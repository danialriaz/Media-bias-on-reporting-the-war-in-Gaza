Here is where things stand: \nIsraeli forces continued their offensive against Hamas in northern Gaza, closing in on the Indonesian hospital where thousands of patients and displaced people have been sheltering for weeks.  The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “appalled”  by reports that 12 people, including patients, were killed in overnight shelling at the last hospital operating in northern Gaza. Some 200 patients have been evacuated  from the Indonesian hospital on Monday, Gaza’s health ministry has said.The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that health services in Gaza have suffered “catastrophic” damage, with most hospitals no longer functioning. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies programme, warned that the thousands of injuries sustained by civilians across Gaza, combined with the growing public health crisis  in the besieged enclave,  is a “recipe for epidemics”.  He also described Israel’s cooperation for humanitarian relief in Gaza as “subpar”. The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said a clinic it operated in Gaza City was attacked on Monday morning.  Part of the building was engulfed in flames, it said, and four marked MSF cars were burned while a fifth was found crushed by a heavy vehicle or a tank. The charity said  it was not immediately aware of the status of one member of staff and 20 family members.Twenty-eight premature babies were rescued  from al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City and taken to Egypt on Monday. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said 31 “very sick” babies were moved from al-Shifa hospital in a joint operation with the UN and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, and 12 of them had been flown to Cairo.  Three babies remain in Gaza.Israel and Hamas appear to be edging towards a deal that would see the release of a significant number of hostages,possibly in return  for a limited ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Joe Biden on Monday said he believed a deal is near , and the White House later said the US is “doing everything we can” and that it believed “we’re closer than we’ve ever been”. Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas have clashed with far-right Israeli politicians who want to bring in the death penalty as a possible sentence for captured Hamas members. The families said on Monday  that even talk of doing so might endanger the lives of their relatives. The row  underlines the deep divisions in Israel over how to deal with the hostage crisis.The UN secretary general has said it is clear that the war in Gaza has seen “a killing of civilians that is unparalleled and unprecedented  in any conflict” since he began his role in 2017. At a press conference on Monday, António Guterres also said he did not believe a UN protectorate in Gaza would be a solution to the conflict and that war must “move in a determined, irreversible way to a two-state solution”. Relief trucks originally from Jordan entered Gaza from Egypt on Monday with the intention of setting up a new field hospitalin the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. Jordanian state media said it hoped the facility  would help ease some of the humanitarian crisis as Israel’s forces seize medical facilities in the north.Yemen’s Houthi rebels said they have seized what they called an Israeli cargo ship in the Red Sea, and warned that all vessels linked to Israel “will become a legitimate target for armed forces”.  They have since released video footage reportedly  showing armed men seizing a ship. Israel said the vessel was a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo ship.\nblock-time published-time 2.14am GMT \nHere are some recent photographs from Gaza: \n    A Palestinian woman walks on building rubble following an Israeli strike in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on 20 November 2023.

They were on the way from north to south Gaza , heading for the Rafah crossing point on Sunday, when he was arrested along with other Palestinian men at an Israeli military checkpoint.\n“The army took Mosab when he arrived at the checkpoint, leaving from the north to the south, as the army had ordered.

Towns were raided, curfews imposed, teenagers arrested, detainees beaten, and villages stormed by Jewish vigilantes.\nWith the world’s attention on Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there, the violence of war has also erupted in the West Bank. Israeli settler attacks have surged at an unprecedented rate, according to the United Nations. The escalation has spread fear, deepened despair, and robbed Palestinians of their livelihoods, their homes and, in some cases, their lives.\nBefore the Hamas assault, 2023 already was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank in over two decades, with 250 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire, most during military operations.\nOver these six weeks of war, Israeli security forces have killed another 206 Palestinians, the Palestinian Health Ministry said, the result of a rise in army raids backed by airstrikes and Palestinian militant attacks. \nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.36am GMT\nblock-time published-time 12.16am GMT \nAl Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud reports that the “northern part of Gaza City right now is under heavy bombardment and air strikes”.\nMahmoud is in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, and writes, “Where we are reporting from, in Khan Younis, has also been a major target of Israeli air strikes.

He said:\nI think we need a multi-stakeholder approach in which different countries, different entities, will cooperate. For Israel, of course, the US is the main guarantor of its security. For Palestinians, the neighbouring and Arab countries of the region are essential.\nSo everybody needs to come together to make the conditions for a transition, allowing for a strengthened Palestinian Authority, to assume responsibility in Gaza and then, based on that, to finally move... in a determined and irreversible way to a two-state solution based on the principles that have been largely established by the international community and which I have time and time again outlined.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.53pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 5.24pm GMT \n World is witnessing an 'unparalleled and unprecedented' killing of civilians in Gaza, says UN chief  \nThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said it is clear that the war in Gaza has seen “a killing of civilians that is unparalleled and unprecedented in any conflict” since he began his role in 2017.\nGuterres, in a press conference on Monday, said: “What is clear is that we have had in a few weeks thousands of children killed.”\nHis remarks came as Gaza authorities said at least 13,300 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since  7 October .

Here is an excerpt from today:\nEvery morning, thousands of people are in the streets looking for what they need: food, medicine, blankets, heavy clothes. I saw a mother screaming at her young son in the middle of the street. It turned out that he got distracted and she had been looking for him for almost an hour.\n“How would I find you if you got lost?” she screamed. Other women were calming her down.\nThese days we hear many stories about parents who lost their children, whether while fleeing or in public places. Most of the evacuating people are in these new areas for the first time, they may have passed by them before, or visited, but knowing the area is really difficult when most people have lost their ability to focus due to fear, stress or lack of sleep.\nI remember talking to my friend who had a new baby girl months ago. “I know this will sound scary, but please, write on your daughter’s body all the identification information in marker, just in case,” I said. He was silent for a second, then he told me that he agreed with me.\nI have witnessed several times the same situation, a group of boys go out to play with a ball, and the parents, usually fathers, would go out angry and tell them to get back inside. “If a bombing happens now, what will happen to you?! Go inside, immediately.”\n Read more of Ziad’s diary from Gaza here: Gaza diary part 23 – ‘Really?

A version has been accepted by legislatures in at least eight states, including Pennsylvania, Nebraska and North Dakota.\nThe resolution adopts Israeli claims that Hamas  uses “civilians as human shields” and names Iran as giving logistical support to the group.\nSome state legislatures have also denounced calls for a ceasefire in Israel’s assault on Gaza.  Although state legislatures have limited direct influence over Washington’s policy on Israel, Alec and allied groups have long been instrumental in mobilising political pressure by pushing local legislation and resolutions in support of the Jewish state. They include laws to block and punish  support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel’s oppression of the Palestinians.\n Read more of Chris McGreal’s report here: Rightwing group pressures states to pass pro-Israel resolutions\n Related:  Rightwing group pressures states to pass pro-Israel resolutions\nblock-time published-time 12.10pm GMT \n 28 premature babies evacuated from Gaza into Egypt – reports  \nA picture has been issued showing the ambulances carrying premature Palestinian babies who have been evacuated from al-Shifa hospital in the process of crossing into Egypt via the Rafah border crossing.\n    Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances transporting premature babies await passage through the Rafah crossing.

The national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has called for the death penalty, which is dormant on Israel’s law books, Reuters reports.\nYarden Gonen, whose sister Romi is among the hostages, told Ben-Gvir and his party colleagues during a parliamentary panel: “It would mean playing along with their mind games. And in return we would get pictures of our loves ones murdered, ended, with the state of Israel and not them [Hamas] being blamed for it.\n“Don’t pursue this until after they are back here. Don’t put my sister’s blood on your hands.”\nSome of the relatives of the people held captive by Hamas in Gaza worry that the publicity around the capital punishment debate could invite reprisals even as hopes of a deal to free some of them is growing. A number of suspected Palestinian gunmen were detained in Israel after members of Hamas breached the Gaza Strip border on 7 October.\nGonen was one of the relatives of the hostages who took part in a five-day march from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem last week. She told the Guardian  on Saturday that the families felt neglected by the government. “We need to see that they’re doing everything in their power to get the hostages back home,” Yarden said. “And we’re not going to back down.”\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.17pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 11.32am GMT \nThe BBC is reporting that only 28 of the 31 premature babies are being transferred because one baby has no identified parents to sign consent forms for the transfer, and that for “personal circumstances” two of the babies’ families preferred them to stay in Gaza.\nEthar Shalaby, of the BBC Arabic Service, spoke to Dr Mohamed Salama, the head of the neo-natal unit at al-Ahli Emirates hospital where the babies were being cared for.

It takes hours to get to a market, because there’s no fuel for cars. It takes hours to queue for supplies or to use the bathroom, and you can’t cook more food than you need for the next day, because you don’t have a fridge. It doesn’t matter who you are, or who you were before this: everything takes a long time, and there’s nothing to spend your money on. The cycle starts again constantly, for everyone.”\nMost people Kaamil speaks to have loved ones who’ve been killed since the war began. That is the context for how they perceive Israel’s campaign: “I hear the word genocide a lot more now,” Kaamil said. “That is a very complicated and contested term, but it’s what people there feel.”\nBecause of the unique misfortune of their geopolitical circumstances, people in Gaza are quite often treated as if they see everything through a political lens; an answer to whether they support Hamas, even before 7 October, was far more likely to be how they would be heard by the wider world than the equivalent question to somebody living in Europe or the US.\n“But if you ask somebody a question like that, it doesn’t mean they were thinking about it before you asked them,” Kaamil said. “My experience of Gaza is as a place full of people finding creative ways to get by, and to enjoy their lives. I don’t know anybody who visited Gaza who didn’t enjoy it, and find it, despite everything, actually a nice place to be. That’s part of why it feels so important to show how people are surviving, or trying to survive, now.”\n Read more here: Monday briefing – the Palestinians determined to get the word out on life inside Gaza\n Related:  Monday briefing: The Palestinians determined to get the word out on life inside Gaza\nSign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.23am GMT\nblock-time published-time 6.57am GMT \nIn an update on the 31 premature babies evacuated from al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on Sunday, health officials say they are in “extremely critical condition”.\nThe newborns had dehydration, hypothermia and sepsis in some cases, said Mohamed Zaqout, the director of Gaza hospitals.\nFour other babies died in the two days before the evacuation, Associated Press quoted him as also saying.\nThe babies from the hospital, where power was cut and supplies ran out while Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants outside, were receiving urgent care in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.\n    Palestinian medics care for babies evacuated from al-Shifa hospital to the Emirates hospital in Rafah, southern Gaza.

"Families criticise UK government’s repatriation guidance in Gaza conflict","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-20 05:00:00," POLITICS; Version:1",694," Geneva Abdul"," Relative ‘shocked’ by advice for family members who crossed into Egypt to split temporarily and apply for reunification from Britain","\nRelatives of British citizens recently evacuated from Gaza and those waiting to return to the UK have criticised the government’s repatriation guidance, as UK officials continue to support nationals crossing into Egypt.\nAhmad Abou-Foul’s family safely crossed from Gaza into Egypt on 3 November. He said they were “shocked” after arriving in Cairo when UK immigration officers advised the individuals with British passports to return to the UK with their children, and once there, start a reunification process for their Palestinian spouses.\n“They were asking us to split a four-month-old from his mother – and a one-year-old and two-year-old,” said Abou-Foul, an NHS surgeon from Birmingham, whose 16 relatives – including young children – returned to the UK on Saturday.\n“We were shocked. Probably they didn’t have a plan; this is what we felt,” he said.\nAfter enduring weeks of Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 12,000 people , the family asked officials why they were being treated differently than in recent evacuations, such as those from Sudan , Ukraine and Afghanistan.  Abou-Foul said the family were told that each situation was different.\nAbou-Foul paid £16,000 in visa fees for three adults and two children. The family was not given any guidance or informed of any fee waivers, he said, and were asked to arrange their return at their own cost. The Guardian understands there have been repatriation cases in which individuals have had visa fees waived.\n“What was the reason for us to be given this option?” said Abou-Foul, adding he did not think it was intentional but due to insufficient planning by the UK government. \n“Why weren’t we supported by the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office]?\n“If I have to do it again, I will do it again, because at that time I would have paid everything I have to get my family to safety.”\nWhile the family is among the hundreds of foreign nationals  who have escaped Israel’s airstrikes and the spiralling humanitarian crisis, more than 2 million people in Gaza, almost half of whom are children, remain under siege after Hamas militants killed at least 1,200 people and abducted 240 hostages in a surprise attack on Israel on 7 October.\nThe Rafah crossing first opened on 1 November to allow specific groups of foreign nationals and the seriously wounded to leave. By early November, more than half  of the British nationals seeking to escape Gaza  for Egypt had managed to do so.\nThe Guardian understands that transportation to Cairo and two nights’ of accommodation is being provided to British nationals and their dependants. While flights are not being facilitated, loans are being offered in a temporary exchange for passports.\n“It’s not easy to afford the cost of the four tickets,” said a British national in Cairo who asked to remain anonymous.\n“I can’t think how I am going to pay back the loan while my medical centre is closed, maybe damaged, and we left everything in Gaza.”\nFor six weeks, the family lived under Israeli bombardment, moving from northern Gaza to Khan Younis, the biggest city in the south, where tens of thousands of people have been evacuated in recent weeks.\nAfter evacuating from Gaza seven days ago, the family has extended their stay in Egypt as they wait for a visa to be processed for a family member without a British passport. \nTessa Gregory, a human rights team partner at the law firm Leigh Day, said: “Our client and her British family who were living in Gaza have fled a war zone where they have survived desperate conditions and witnessed unspeakable violence.\n“In these circumstances the British government should be doing everything within its power to get the family back to the UK as quickly as possible so they can start to rebuild their lives.\n“We hope the Foreign Office will now reconsider its policy and cover the costs of flights for this family.”\nA government spokesperson said: “The safety of British nationals remains a top priority. \n“We are working at pace to support British families who have crossed the border into Egypt, making sure any dependants who need a visa can apply for one and that appropriate checks are carried out in a timely manner.”\nEnd of Document\nAfternoon Update: richest 10% causing 50% of emissions; Optus CEO resigns; and Argentina’s Trump elected president"," November 20, 2023",2023-11-28

The vessel, a car carrier, had been heading towards India from Europe with no cargo, a spokesperson said.\nThe Marine Traffic tracking site said the Galaxy Leader had “departed from Korfez, Turkey, and was on its way to Pipavav, India. Went offline on Saturday south-west of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.”\nThe office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said a ship – which it did not name – had been seized. There were no Israelis aboard and Israel was not involved in its ownership or operation, his office said.\n“This is another Iranian act of terrorism that represents an escalation in Iran’s belligerence against the citizens of the free world, with concomitant international ramifications vis-a-vis the security of global shipping routes,” his office said.\nOn 14 November, the Houthi rebel leader, Abdul Malik al-Huthi, said the group was on the lookout for Israeli vessels in the commercially vital waters of the Red Sea – even those that did not have Israeli flags.\n“Our eyes are open to constant monitoring and searching for any Israeli ship,” he said in a speech broadcast by the rebels’ Al-Masirah TV station.\n                     Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report                   \nEnd of Document\nEmily Hand’s father pleads for Hamas to release her amid hope of hostage deal"," November 20, 2023",2023-11-28

"Israel has long wanted Palestinians out of Gaza – my father saw it firsthand","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-20 06:00:00," OPINION; Version:2",1115," Raja Shehadeh"," Decades after the 1967 war, Israel is still under the illusion that violence against the Palestinians will give it peace and security","\nFifty-six years ago, after Israel’s victory in the six-day war in 1967, an intensive debate took place in the country regarding the future of the newly occupied West Bank and Gaza. The options ranged from outright annexation of the land by Israel, returning the West Bank to Jordan or the establishment of a Palestinian state.\nMy father, Aziz Shehadeh, was a proponent of the last. As a lawyer and activist for refugee rights, he proposed a Palestinian state living side by side with Israel. Washington urged Israel then to translate its undefined position for a settlement into concrete terms.\nIn the midst of Israel’s brutal attack on Gaza, the US is again urging Israel to come up with a plan for the day after. However, as in 1967, Israel’s driving ambitions now focus on retaining as much of the land as possible and getting rid of as many Palestinians as possible.\nIn 1967, Israeli policymakers were adamant about keeping the occupied Gaza Strip. As early as 8 June 1967, Golda Meir, the then secretary general of ruling party Mapai, stated in a meeting of the party’s political committee that she was for “getting rid of its Arabs”. The Israeli cabinet resolution 563, of 19 June 1967, determined that “according to the international border, the Gaza Strip is located within the territory of the state of Israel”. Yet because of the large Palestinian population in Gaza, annexation of the territory, as had happened in East Jerusalem , was not a viable option.\nMass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza was also not feasible while the world was watching. So other strategies were employed. The first of these was to make life unbearable, by ruling with an iron fist and keeping the standard of living very low. The second was by encouraging emigration. Personally supervised by the prime minister, Levi Eshkol, this strategy relied on financial incentives. By mid-1968, tens of thousands had left the Strip , mostly for Jordan. But Jordan decided to stop admitting them, so Israel increased its attempts to boost emigration of Palestinians to non-Arab countries such as Brazil and other South American states, as well as Canada and Australia, but with little success. In the end, none of these strategies brought about significant results, leading Eshkol to lament , “I still don’t know how to get rid of them.”\nAfter the passage of more than five decades, and even with the imposition of a 16-year siege  of the Strip, it is clear that none of these strategies have worked and most of the Palestinian population of Gaza, composed mainly of refugees from 1948 when Israel was established, remained there and increased from 400,000 to 2.2 million. Now, with the war on Gaza, Israel seems to be seizing the opportunity to carry out what has not been possible in all the previous years.\nIn the wake of the 7 October killings, Israel launched a massive strike against Hamas, ostensibly to destroy its military strength, backed by sympathetic public support. But as my colleague, the human rights activist Raji Sourani, who lives in Gaza City, told me over the phone a few days ago, the war he is experiencing is not against Hamas; instead, bombs are striking locations that are heavily populated by civilians. \nEvents point to Israel’s strategy of emptying the north of Gaza of its Palestinian population, with both the massive bombardment that has damaged at least 222,000 residential units , and the refusal to accept a ceasefire so essential life-saving provisions cannot enter. All this shows the massive pressure on the Palestinian population to move south, thus ethnically cleansing the north. There is little prospect that this strategy is intended to keep the civilians out of harm’s way, as Israel has announced, or that it will be reversed after hostilities end. When the fighting stops there would be few buildings in the north still standing for people to move back into to restore their homes and livelihoods.\nToday, almost six decades after my father’s failed effort to convince the Israeli government to make peace with the Palestinians based on sharing the land, I feel the dreadful consequences of this failure. The killing of 11,000 people  by Israeli forces, the attacks taking place in the West Bank by both the Israeli army and Jewish settlers that have led to the deaths of 200 Palestinians , and the failure of the world to deter Israel’s excesses has ushered profound fear into my own life.\nThe cries of the man with dual Irish-Palestinian nationality who lived in Gaza’s Beach camp on the shore of the Mediterranean still ring in my ears. He said to an Al Jazeera reporter that his camp was being bombed from all sides by Israel, and he wondered whether he would survive. He was in darkness with only a torch lighting his face. He asked how much more suffering we must endure before the world stops this, then most poignantly asked the viewers: “Are you enjoying this?” I wonder whether he survived the Israeli bombings. Or another man who, after informing the reporter, “They’re bombing the camp continuously,” said, “We’re leaving our home. We’re moving to al-Shifa hospital.” He ended with the plea: “Do something. Do something.” I thought of him as the hospital was surrounded  by the Israeli army.\nEverything that gave me hope that when violence reaches an unconscionable point and excessive violations of human rights are committed, Israel will be made to stop, is shattered now. I used to have faith that we would be protected by international humanitarian law, or by an outcry from the Israeli public against the excesses of their government – yet at this point I see no hope in either. Nor does it seem that there is hope that Israel will wake up from the delusion that war and violence against the Palestinians and its unassailable military strength will give it peace and security. This leaves us Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories vulnerable and with serious danger for our lives and our future presence in this land.\nAnd yet, despite it all, I find myself echoing Raji Sourani, a friend with whom I have gone through a lot over the past decades. Last week he wrote  in Jacobin magazine: “We deserve justice and we deserve freedom. We believe we are on the right side of history and that we are the stones of the valley. Despite the immensity of the challenges we face, people here do not give up.”\n                                                               Raja Shehadeh is a Palestinian lawyer and writer, and founder of the human rights organisation Al-Haq.

"IDF closes in on Indonesian hospital in Gaza as 12 people reportedly killed","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-20 06:10:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:7",814," Dan Sabbagh in Jerusalem"," Medical worker says ‘women and children are terrified’ amid fears of repeat of events at al-Shifa hospital complexIsrael-Hamas war: live updates","\nA dozen people reportedly have been killed at another major medical facility in northern Gaza as Israeli forces close in on the packed Indonesian hospital despite hopes that a ceasefire-for-hostages deal may be agreed.\nVideo broadcast on  Al Jazeera TV on Monday showed damage to what were described as patient facilities, while daytime footage on social media appeared to show Israeli tanks close to the medical complex.\nOne medical worker, Marwan Abdallah, said the tanks were clearly visible from the hospital windows. “Women and children are terrified. There are constant sounds of explosions and gunfire,” he said.\nThe ministry of health in Gaza said it believed 12 people had been killed in shelling overnight and that it feared a repeat of what happened at al-Shifa hospital complex , which was surrounded and raided by Israeli forces last week.\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces, although in the past  the Israeli military said it believed a Hamas tunnel entrance was near to the Indonesian hospital and that missiles were launched into Israel from nearby.\nThe ministry of health said 700 people, including medical staff, were crowded into the Indonesian hospital, the last hospital operating in northern Gaza. Broadcast footage showed wounded people and sheltering civilians packed into its corridors, seeking treatment or safety from the fighting.\nEfforts were being made to coordinate a rescue of patients with the Red Cross, the health ministry said, although it said it had received no commitments from Israel about allowing safe passage. Only 10 out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remain open, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The Indonesian hospital was coming under “extreme pressure”, the WHO executive director Michael Ryan said.\nRetno Marsudi, Indonesia’s foreign minister, said the attack on the hospital “was a clear violation of international humanitarian laws” and urged Israel’s allies to call on it to “stop its atrocities”. The hospital in the far north of the Gaza Strip was established with the help of donations from the south-east Asian country.\nSeparately, the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said a clinic it operated in Gaza City came under attack on Monday morning. Part of the building was engulfed in flames, it said, and four marked MSF cars were burned while a fifth was found crushed by a heavy vehicle or a tank. The charity said it was not immediately aware of the status of one member of staff and 20 family members.\nIsrael invaded Gaza at the end of October after a Hamas attack three weeks earlier that killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians. Israel responded with an almost immediate aerial bombardment of the densely populated strip, before launching the ground invasion. In total, more than 13,000 Palestinians have died.\nAn estimated 1.7 million Palestinians living in Gaza have also been displaced since the start of the war, according to figures from UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) released on Monday. The population of the strip was estimated at 2.3 million before Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel. \nThere have been hopes that Israel and Hamas may be edging towards a deal  in talks brokered by Qatar that would lead to the release of a significant number of the 240 hostages  held by Hamas, possibly in return for a limited ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.\nSenior US and Israeli officials and the Qatari prime minister all suggested that an agreement was close on Sunday, although observers have cautioned that public statements during such negotiations are often misleading and any potential deal could easily collapse.\nRelief trucks originally from Jordan entered Gaza from Egypt on Monday with the intention of setting up a new field hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. Jordanian state media said it hoped the facility would help ease some of the humanitarian crisis as Israel’s forces seize medical facilities in the north.\nIn an effort coordinated by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, 28 premature babies were rescued from Shifa hospital and taken to Egypt. Three babies remained in Gaza, two for family reasons and one because the family could not be identified.\nThe WHO said on Sunday that the hospital had become a “death zone” , with a mass grave at the entrance and only 25 staff left to care for 291 seriously ill patients, who it was feared were too ill to be moved despite the fighting.\nIsrael says Hamas runs operations from under Shifa, and on Sunday evening it released video footage that it said showed two hostages being taken into the facility on 7 October.\nR Adm Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the military, released CCTV video that appeared to show two hostages, said to be a Nepali and a Thai man, entering the hospital. One of the two was clearly injured and was being carried on a hospital trolley.\nEnd of Document\nHostages’ families clash with Israeli politicians over talk of death penalty"," November 20, 2023",2023-11-28
"Monday briefing: The Palestinians determined to get the word out on life inside Gaza","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-20 06:52:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",2494," Archie Bland"," In today’s newsletter: Caught in the Israel-Hamas conflict, people in Gaza are using social media and more to grieve and tell their story Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition","\nGood morning. As the death toll has risen in Gaza since the beginning of the war, and amid ongoing debates  about which figures are to be trusted, Palestinians have sometimes used variations of a phrase to describe their despair at how invisible their individual losses have been to the wider world: “we are not numbers”.\nBecause of repeated internet blackouts, power outages making communication difficult and the danger to journalists on the ground, the stories of specific people that might work against that perception have often been difficult to tell. But through accounts like the Guardian’s serialised Gaza diary  by 35-year-old Palestinian Ziad – who has described everything from having his messages of condolence finished by his phone’s autocomplete function  to trying to save the family goldfish  – and the many vivid social media posts coming out of the territory, it has been possible to understand something of the plight experienced by those on the ground.\nMeanwhile, Kaamil Ahmed, a reporter on the Guardian’s global development desk, has been writing about the Palestinians he has managed to reach by WhatsApp, direct message and phone. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Kaamil about the work of telling those stories, and what they tell us about how Palestinians are trying to survive. Here are the headlines.\n                   Five big stories                   \n                                            Israel-Hamas war  | Israel and Hamas appear to be edging towards a deal  that would see the release of a significant number of hostages, possibly in return for a limited ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.

See an obituary  and a life in pictures. \n                   In depth: ‘Every day is a new battle’                   \nThere is no way for journalists to get into Gaza without an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) escort, and at least 48 of those on the ground have been killed so far  ; the Committee to Protect Journalists says that 43 of them are Palestinian. Ever since the 7 October attack by Hamas that killed over 1,200 Israelis , the stories of ordinary people living through Israel’s bombardment of Gaza have often emerged in other ways.\nKaamil Ahmed used to report in Jerusalem, and sometimes travelled to Gaza for work. After war broke out last month, he started to reach out to his old Palestinian contacts. “But it’s been a very slow process,” he said. “It’s so hard to get hold of people. So as well as that, I’ve been starting again through social media and messaging people posting about the war to ask if they’ll speak to me about what they’ve been through.”\nStories that would take a day for a local reporter in normal circumstances are now the work of a week or more. But through his old contacts and his new ones, Kaamil has told stories of swimming instructors  and writers , English teachers  and breakdancers.  And through those stories, some persistent themes have emerged of how civilians are navigating an unimaginably frightening new reality.\n***\nNot everyone wants to talk\nAmong the most useful tools for finding people who want to talk has been Snapchat, which – unlike other social media apps – allows a user to search for posts on a geographic heatmap. “Instead of being filtered by an algorithm based on who you already know, you can reach anyone who’s posting – that’s a good way to get a broader view of what’s happening on the ground,“ Kaamil said. On Instagram, meanwhile, Palestinian users like Motaz Azaiza  and Bisan Owda  are gaining millions of followers.\nIt’s probably too simple to claim that people in Gaza are universally determined to tell their stories when so many are naturally preoccupied with survival, or have little faith in the outside world to pay attention. And Kaamil is unsettled by the risk of interviews feeling “transactional” – “like you’re jumping in, and taking something, and moving on”.\nBut, he adds, “most people who are using social media – the reason they are doing it is because they think people need to see how they’re living. A lot of people do see something important in describing what is happening to them.” In those circumstances, he added, “it feels very weird to go through the usual niceties – it seems stupid to ask someone how they are. The conversations are accelerated. If people want to talk, they usually want to get to the point.”\n***\nBlackouts and power shortages mean communication is precious\nThe repeated shutdowns of communications in Gaza that appear to have been imposed by Israel  during particularly intense periods of fighting have meant that those waiting for updates on the wellbeing of their friends and loved ones from afar have been kept in the dark. Even when connections are restored, Kaamil said, “they barely have any electricity, so they’re not leaving their phones on all the time”.\nWhen the first blackout happened, one contact of his, the swimming instructor whose Facebook profile turned from celebrations of his students’ successes to tributes to the dead , disappeared from WhatsApp for four days. “And you may not get responses from people for a long time even if they have access to offices and more reliable services,” he added. “Anyone who has a way to communicate is a conduit for information, so they’re being bombarded. You just have to wait and hope they’re ok.”\n***\nThe struggle to survive begins again every day\nAs Kaamil has heard these stories, he’s been struck by the impossibility for the residents of Gaza of looking beyond their most immediate needs. “Every day is a new battle,” he said. “To find water, to find bread, to charge phones. It takes hours to get to a market, because there’s no fuel for cars. It takes hours to queue for supplies or to use the bathroom, and you can’t cook more food than you need for the next day, because you don’t have a fridge. It doesn’t matter who you are, or who you were before this: everything takes a long time, and there’s nothing to spend your money on. The cycle starts again constantly, for everyone.”\nMost people Kaamil speaks to have loved ones who’ve been killed since the war began. That is the context for how they perceive Israel’s campaign: “I hear the word genocide a lot more now,” Kaamil said. “That is a very complicated and contested term [ this piece explains  differing interpretations of what it means, and why Israelis and Palestinians alike feel it is a threat that they now face], but it’s what people there feel.”\n***\nCivilians in Gaza are no more inherently political than anyone else\nBecause of the unique misfortune of their geopolitical circumstances, people in Gaza are quite often treated as if they see everything through a political lens; an answer to whether they support Hamas, even before 7 October, was far more likely to be how they would be heard by the wider world than the equivalent question to somebody living in Europe or the US.\n“But if you ask somebody a question like that, it doesn’t mean they were thinking about it before you asked them,” Kaamil said. “My experience of Gaza is as a place full of people finding creative ways to get by, and to enjoy their lives. I don’t know anybody who visited Gaza who didn’t enjoy it, and find it, despite everything, actually a nice place to be. That’s part of why it feels so important to show how people are surviving, or trying to survive, now.”\n                   What else we’ve been reading                                                               When The Crown first aired, it was considered prestige TV.

"‘It’s part of our psyche’: why Ireland sides with ‘underdog’ Palestine","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-20 10:27:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:7",1063," Rory Carroll and Lisa O'Carroll"," Ireland is seen as an outlier in the EU – but its sympathy for the suffering in Gaza is rooted in its own history","\nThe video clips have pinged around the world on social media eliciting applause, anger and a puzzled question: why are Irish politicians so outspoken  about Israel’s bombardment of Gaza?\nThe taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, described the assault as “approaching revenge”, the foreign minister, Micheál Martin, called it “disproportionate” and opposition politicians went much further in calling it mass murder. Some wore the keffiyeh in parliament.\nPro-Palestinian commentators have hailed the statements as an example to the rest of Europe on how to denounce an offensive  that has reportedly killed more than 11,000 people.\nPro-Israelis have called Ireland’s responses blinkered and a negation of Israel’s right to defend itself after Hamas killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 240 in southern Israel on 7 October.\nIsrael’s heritage minister, Amichai Eliyahu, urged Palestinians to “go to Ireland or the desert”. Israel’s government disowned his suggestion, but the outburst underscored a perception that Ireland is an outlier in the European Union. \nThere have been pro-Palestinian marches across Ireland  and opposition parties have tried – but failed – to compel the government to refer Israel to the international criminal court and expel Israel’s ambassador, Dana Erlich. More than 600 academics signed a letter urging universities to sever institutional links with Israeli institutions.\n“Irish people are passionate about Palestine, they really understand what’s happening,” Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid, the Palestinian ambassador to Ireland, said in an interview at her mission’s office in Dublin. “I’m privileged to be here.”\nShe lauded the government’s campaign for a ceasefire and said she had been honoured by a rapturous ovation at a Sinn Féin  party conference, where delegates chanted “free Palestine”. Palestinians were sharing clips of Irish legislators backing their cause, said Abdalmajid. “They see the support.”\nSympathy for Palestinians is rooted in Ireland’s history, said Niall Holohan, a retired diplomat who was based in Ramallah from 2002-2006 as the Irish government’s representative to the Palestinian Authority. “We feel we have been victimised over the centuries. It’s part of our psyche – underneath it all we side with the underdog.”\nJane Ohlmeyer, a Trinity College Dublin history professor and the author of Making Empire: Ireland, Imperialism, and the Early Modern World , said Ireland had been Britain’s oldest colony and a template for Palestine. “This has undoubtedly shaped how people from Ireland engage with postcolonial conflicts.”\nEven before the latest conflict, parts of Northern Ireland were using proxy tribal identifications – Israeli flags for loyalist areas and Palestinian iconography for republican areas.\nHolohan claims that another factor in Ireland’s outlook has been its tiny community of approximately 2,500 Jews – barely 0.05% of the population – that contrasts with sizeable and influential Jewish communities in Britain and France.\nIreland was the first EU state to endorse Palestinian statehood – in 1980 – and the first last month to publicly denounce  the Hungarian commissioner, Olivér Várhelyi, after he unilaterally announced on social media that all funding for Palestinians would be suspended. Varadkar also accused Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s pro-Israel president, of “ lacking balance  ”.\nIreland got public support from Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg’s outgoing foreign minister. He told reporters this week, before his last ministers’ summit in Brussels, that for the past decade EU member states “didn’t give a fuck” about Palestinian statehood – with two exceptions. “There were two countries here that tried to put it on the agenda, me and the Irish.”\nIreland strives to nudge the EU towards “a more just” position but avoids solo runs, said Holohan, who noted that France and other members had echoed its call for a ceasefire. “We want to remain within the European consensus.”\nOn Thursday Martin, the foreign minister, visited a kibbutz that was targeted on 7 October and met Israeli and Palestinian leaders. He called the Hamas attack “savage” and reiterated a plea for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying Israel’s belief in a military solution was mistaken.\nIreland’s underdog impulse originally resulted in support for the Jewish quest for an embryonic nation state – a sentiment reciprocated by the Zionist Irgun movement that drew on the experience of Irish rebels when it fought the British occupation of Palestine in the 1940s.\nBut Israel’s capture of the West Bank in 1967  and invasion of Lebanon in 1982  – which put Irish UN peacekeepers in the firing line – helped tilt Dublin’s sympathies.\n“It has morphed into the narrative that while the Irish fought to remove the occupiers so, too, are the Palestinians trying to remove the ‘occupiers’,” said Maurice Cohen, chair of the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland. He said people forgot that the former Israeli president Chaim Herzog – father of the current president, Isaac Herzog – was born in Belfast and grew up in Dublin.\nAntisemitism was proliferating on social media and condemnation of Hamas atrocities tended to be perfunctory – “a collective ‘selective amnesia’ to October 7 appears to have set in”, said Cohen. “Most concerning is the surreptitious shunning and remarks and collective blame in the workplace where there are Jewish people and Israelis present.”\nHolohan, the retired diplomat, said Irish people had a blind spot about Hamas , which he called a repressive and extremist Islamist organisation. “They simply don’t know enough about it.”\nCieren Perry, a councillor who sponsored a failed motion to fly a Palestinian flag over Dublin city hall, said he hoped outrage over Gaza’s suffering would force the Irish government to send stronger signals to Washington and Brussels. “It’s mad, mind-boggling, to think there are people not calling for a ceasefire.”\n This article was amended on 23 November 2023 to remove part of a quote for editorial reasons. An earlier footnote was wrong to state that the Jewish population in Ireland was roughly similar, proportionately, to the Jewish population in the UK. The percentage figures are in fact different by a factor of 10 (about 0.05% in Ireland, and roughly 0.5% in the UK). An earlier amendment to the text made on 21 November 2023 has been removed and the original text restored.\nEnd of Document\nRightwing group pressures states to pass pro-Israel resolutions"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28

A version has been accepted by legislatures in at least eight states, including Pennsylvania, Nebraska and North Dakota.\nThe resolution adopts Israeli claims that Hamas uses “civilians as human shields” and names Iran as giving logistical support to the group.\nSome state legislatures have also denounced calls for a ceasefire in Israel’s assault on Gaza, where the health ministry says more than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed, two-thirds of them women and children.\nAlthough state legislatures have limited direct influence over Washington’s policy on Israel, Alec and allied groups have long been instrumental in mobilising political pressure by pushing local legislation and resolutions in support of the Jewish state. They include laws to block and punish  support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel’s oppression of the Palestinians.\nAlec, which is corporate-funded but has deep ties to Christian evangelicals strongly supportive of Israel, pushed the model resolution to state legislatures after an emergency meeting two weeks ago. A copy of the agenda  obtained by the Center for Media and Democracy shows that the presentation of the case for supporting Israel was made by Rabbi Aryeh Lightstone, who is close to the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\nNetanyahu offered Lightstone a leading role in his 2021 election campaign, according to  the Times of Israel, after the Orthodox rabbi worked as a senior aide to the US ambassador to Jerusalem in the Trump administration, David Friedman.\nAmong the others who spoke at the Alec meeting was the Texas state senator Phil King, a member of the group’s board of directors. He was the lead sponsor of a bill  in support of Israel’s attack on Gaza passed by the Texas senate two days after Hamas killed about 1,200 people and abducted more than 200 in its cross-border assault on 7 October.\nThe resolution accused Hamas of using human shields and said Israel had the “right to pursue without interference or condemnation the elimination of Hamas”.\nKing said that the Texas bill formed the basis of Alec’s model resolution for other states.\n“Alec encouraged other state legislatures to adopt similar resolutions which condemn Hamas’ attack on Israel and supports Israel’s right to eliminate Hamas,” he wrote. \nKing was at the forefront of pushing other pro-Israel legislation in Texas. He co-authored a law against boycotts of Israel and was instrumental in Texas becoming the first state to establish a commission to oversee enforcement of the controversial International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, which critics say has at times been used to shut down criticism of the Jewish state.\nKing has also helped forge ties between Israel and the Texas energy companies, and has made trips to Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.\nKarla Jones, the senior director of Alec’s international relations taskforce, told  a St Louis radio programme that the Hamas attacks invigorated support for Israel.\n“This has been one of the most energising issues I think I’ve ever seen. At Alec, we invoked what’s called our expedited situation provision to consider model policy rapidly in 10 days. We have already adopted the model policy and it was adopted unanimously by the members by both public- and private-sector members of our taskforce,” she said.\nAlec’s chief executive, Lisa Nelson, sent an email to supporters last week saying the organisation has “long supported the Israeli people” and urging Americans to press members of their state legislatures to pass the resolution. She listed the states that have adopted Alec’s model wording in some form or other.\n“If your state is not on that list, it should be,” she wrote.\nAlec’s national chair, the speaker of the Florida house of representatives, Daniel Perez, told  a Christian talk radio station that the state legislature called a special session to consider a resolution in support of Israel that says the Jewish state has the right to defend itself “by eliminating Hamas without ceasefire or pause”.\nThe Nebraska legislature adopted  Alec’s language about Hamas using Palestinians as human shields and expressed unconditional support for Israel’s assault on Gaza.\nNorth Dakota passed a resolution  that said Hamas was evidently in “receipt of support and funding from foreign state sponsors of terror, namely Iran”. It too said that Israel has the right to pursue its war aims in Gaza “without interference or condemnation”.\nIn Pennsylvania, a version sponsored by politicians with ties to Alec said that “Israel has every right to defend itself with all due and overwhelming force”. A resolution  backed by one-third of the Wyoming legislature said Israel is in a “battle over good over evil” and opposes calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nLast year Alec promoted a variation of an older resolution passed by several states that included  a statement that “Israel is neither an attacking force nor an occupier of the lands of others”, apparently endorsing the Israeli right wing’s claim that Palestinian lands belong to the Jewish state.\nEarlier versions of the same resolution explicitly supported “the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in the historical region of the Land of Israel”, including the occupied West Bank.\nAlec led the way in the drafting of laws  adopted in more than 30 states to block support for the BDS movement. The group has also sought ways to restrict criticism of Israel  on US university campuses under the guise of combatting antisemitism.\nIsraeli officials, including diplomats and a leader of a group representing Jewish settlers in the West Bank, have attended Alec meetings in the past.\nEnd of Document\nIsrael-Hamas war live: Hamas leader Haniyeh says ‘we are approaching truce agreement’"," November 20, 2023",2023-11-28
"Palestine coach Makram Daboub: ‘The players are doing their best but it is not easy’","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-20 14:00:00," FOOTBALL; Version:3",863," John Duerden"," In their World Cup qualifier against the Socceroos, Palestinian team ‘want to bring a little joy’ to their people amid war","\nThe 7-0 win over Bangladesh in Melbourne last week was about as smooth as possible a start to World Cup qualifying for the Socceroos, but this week’s follow up is set to be anything but that. The Socceroos have landed in a troubled Middle East, where they take on Palestine in a game that has been moved to the neutral venue of Kuwait due to the Israel-Hamas war.\nPalestine have not played at home since 2019 and are no strangers to disrupted preparations. But they had been scheduled to play Australia in the West Bank city of Ramallah before the 7 October attacks, during which Hamas killed 1,200 people and took more than 240 people hostage. Since then, 13,000 residents of Gaza have been killed in the Israeli offensive and vast swaths of the territory have been reduced to rubble.\nThe game in Ramallah would probably have been the biggest to have taken place in Palestine since it became a full Fifa member in 1998. Given the difficulties in getting out of Gaza and the West Bank, Palestine had been training in Jordan since 24 October to ensure they could physically get to their upcoming games. Not all could. Ibrahim Abuimeir, Khaled Al-Nabris and Ahmed Al-Kayed are stuck in Gaza. Many of those who did report for duty are preoccupied with the safety of their friends and family there, as well as in the West Bank.\n“Of course, they are worried about the situation and are watching the news in the hotel or on their phones all the time,” Palestine coach Makram Daboub told Guardian Australia in the buildup to Tuesday’s game (Wednesday AEDT). “They are all anxious. They are doing their best but it is not easy.”\nMentally, there are issues but the team are preparing as best they can. At least there was a short journey – from Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates where they last played – for the team that arrived in Kuwait City on Friday looking fit and full of running against Lebanon. “Everyone is fine physically and everyone is excited to achieve a positive result against the Australian team,” Daboub said.\nHad the game been scheduled for September rather than November, Socceroos coach Graham Arnold and his side would be playing in front of a passionate and proud home crowd. \n“Playing on our home soil and in front of our fans would have given us even greater motivation and a great advantage in our chance to achieve victory,” Daboub said. “Even more so as I think Australia are not accustomed to playing on artificial grass. It would have been a huge event and everyone was looking forward to it. We also have a very good record at home.”\nHowever, with violence also increasing in the West Bank, that home-field advantage has been lost. But there is the prospect of a healthy attendance at the Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium in Kuwait. “We hope that there will be a large crowd that is made up of Palestinians, Kuwaitis and other Arab communities that are residing in Kuwait,” Daboub said. “Their presence will be a great incentive and give us great support.”\nThat was in contrast to the empty stadium that Palestine faced in their opening game. Just hours after Australia put seven past Bangladesh, the lowest-ranked team in the group, Palestine were drawing 0-0 with Lebanon in Sharjah, in a match moved from Beirut due to security issues. For two evenly matched teams, the result was not a surprise but Daboub was pleased with most aspects of the performance which would have been even better had star forward Oday Dabbagh not been denied in the final moments.\n“We deserved to win as we had a lot of scoring opportunities that we could not take,” the Tunisian said. “Lebanon are a strong team, however, and there are still five games left to play.”\nGiven that the top two teams from each of the nine groups of four will advance to the next stage and with Australia and Bangladesh expected to take first and last place, Lebanon and Palestine will probably compete for the second spot. For the latter, a first ever place in the final round of World Cup qualifying is the prize. Any points that can be taken off Australia, ranked 69 places higher at 27th, would be a major bonus.\n“It is going to be very difficult,” said Daboub, who would not reveal whether he would tinker with his usual 4-3-3 formation. “We will be playing against one of the best teams in Asia at the present time, and our focus and mental presence must be high, and we must play with all our strength and fight for the ball on the field to achieve a positive result.”\nDaboub is confident that despite the horrors at home, his players can pull off a result that would not only set the team on course for a first-ever final round spot but would be something historic and meaningful for millions of Palestinians around the world.\n“We will not sit back and defend only,” he said. “We want to win. Whatever happens, I am proud of the players. They are doing their best and want to bring a little joy to the people of Palestine.”\n                                                               Palestine play Australia at 5pm Tuesday (local)/1am Wednesday (AEDT) at Jabar Al-Ahmad International Stadium in Kuwait.

"We must fight antisemitism on UK campuses","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-20 17:43:00," NEWS; Version:1",505,""," Mark Rusling says that a university education is clearly no inoculation against anti-Jewish racism, and Lynne Davies is appalled that Jewish students are being targeted at UK institutions","\nThe description of Jewish fear at British universities by an anonymous student at Oxford University is deeply upsetting and yet deeply unsurprising ( Why is antisemitism so rife in UK academic settings? I have never found student life more difficult, 16 November  ).\nWe like to think that education inoculates us against racism, but that has never been true for anti-Jewish racism. In the 1932 elections in Germany, almost two-thirds of university students voted Nazi (double the rate of their “less educated” peers). The 1942 Wannsee conference  plotted the murder of every European Jew – more than half of the participants held doctorates. University education is not a cure for antisemitism. Might it be a cause?\nLondon in 2023 isn’t Berlin in 1933, but how long ago and how far away is it? In recent weeks there has been a rise in anti-Jewish racism on British campuses. Even some academics have voted for “ Intifada until victory  ”. Clearly, education doesn’t cure racism – and neither does being on the left.\nBecause this is racism. Targeting British Jewish students because of the Israeli government is racist. Calling for an intifada in the UK is racist (and a crime). For more than 20 years, the police have defined racism as “any incident which is perceived to be racist by the victim”. Why do Jews not merit the same protection?\nThis is not about our views on the Middle East; this is homegrown British racism. To fight back against this tide of intolerance, the National Holocaust Museum has launched a racism response unit. Whatever your education, whatever your politics, racism is wrong, and we will fight it. Mark RuslingDirector oflearning, National Holocaust Museum\n I read with sadness and bewilderment about the plight of Jewish students being racially abused at UK universities by other students. It would seem that these Jewish students are being inexplicably punished for the actions of the Israeli government. It makes no more sense than UK Muslims suffering racism because of the actions of Hamas.\nIt is perfectly possible to be opposed to the actions of the Israeli government, despair at the suffering in Gaza and support Palestine and not be anti Jewish. It is perfectly possible to deplore the actions of Hamas without being anti-Muslim or anti-Palestinian.\nSurely now more than ever, we as individuals should be coming together, not spreading hate and more division. We cannot sadly affect the course of the conflict but we can at least try to ensure that both Jewish people and Muslims here are treated with decency and not scapegoated for things outside their control. We need to try to shed a little light on to this darkness. Lynne DaviesStourbridge, West Midlands\n                       Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

"Activists will claim damage to Israeli defence firm in UK was lawfully justified","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-20 18:21:00," UK NEWS; Version:1",410," Haroon Siddique Legal affairs correspondent"," Eight Palestine Action members are charged with offences relating to effort to shut Elbit Systems’ UK arm","\nPalestine Action activists will argue they had “lawful justification” to commit burglary and criminal damage against an Israeli defence company they wanted to shut down, a court has heard.\nThe eight defendants, including the group’s co-founders, are charged with offences relating to a campaign to put Elbit Systems’ UK arm “out of business”.\nOpening the prosecution case at Snaresbrook crown court in north-east London on Monday, Sally Hogan said the defendants, who are not all charged with each of the 13 counts, do not deny committing burglaries, causing damage to the outside of buildings, threatening Elbit’s landlord, Jones Lang LaSalle, in order to put the company out of business nor possession of articles with intent to cause criminal damage, but claim they were entitled to do so in law.\nShe told the jury: “They caused damage to property, damage that caused thousands of pounds. They went into buildings as trespassers with the intent of causing damage … Why did they want to do that? They wanted to put Elbit out of business.\n“They say what we did was with a lawful justification and that is the stark issue for you, members of the jury [to decide upon].”\nHogan said Palestine Action was a “lawful protest group”, set up by Huda Ammori and Richard Barnard, who recruited the other defendants and other individuals to their organisation. She told the jury the prosecution case was that the pair “in a sense directed to others about what they should do”. Hogan said Ammori and Barnard had posted online about what they were doing and “why they said they were justified in taking the action they took”.\nThe prosecutor said that while there was a right to disagree and protest in the UK, the demonstrations by Palestine Action had crossed the line of what was allowed into unlawful protest and had not followed the rule of law.\nShe said: “It won’t have escaped your knowledge that there have been many protests recently but the prosecution say there are rules, there are laws to prevent offences being committed during the course of protests.”\nThe defendants – Ammori, Barnard, Caroline Brouard, Jocelyn Cooney, Robin Refualu, Genevieve Scherer, Nicola Deane and Emily Arnott – are all charged with encouraging people to commit criminal damage against Elbit, which they all deny in fact and in law. They have pleaded not guilty to all of the offences, which are said to have occurred between June 2020 and February 2021.\nThe case is expected to last six weeks.\nEnd of Document\nCorrections and clarifications"," November 20, 2023",2023-11-28
"Hostages’ families clash with Israeli politicians over talk of death penalty","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-20 18:23:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:3",1084," Jason Burke in Jerusalem"," Far-right politicians want to execute militants convicted of 7 October attacks, but relatives say this risks lives of Gaza hostagesIsrael-Hamas war – live updates","\nFamilies of Israeli hostages held by Hamas have clashed with far-right Israeli politicians who want to bring in the death penalty as a possible sentence for captured Palestinian militants.\nThe families said on Monday that even talk of doing so might endanger the lives of their relatives. The row underlines the deep divisions in Israel over how to deal with the hostage crisis.\nReports have suggested that Israel and Hamas are edging towards a deal that would bring the release of a significant number of the more than 240 people seized by the extremist Islamist organisation during their attack in Israel last month, possibly in return for a limited ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.\nThe US president, Joe Biden, said on Monday he believed a deal was near to secure the release of some of the hostages being held by Hamas, telling reporters: “I believe so,” when asked at the White House about a possible agreement.\nIsraeli officials have sent mixed messages, repeatedly denying suggestions by senior US and Israeli officials, as well as the Qatari prime minister, that an agreement was close, but also hinting that progress was being made.\n“I beg you not to capitalise on our suffering now … when the lives of our loved ones are at stake, when the sword is at their necks,” Gil Dickmann, whose cousin is a hostage, told Itamar Ben-Gvir,  Israel’s national security minister, according to Haaretz.\nYarden Gonen, whose sister Romi is among the hostages, told Ben-Gvir and his far-right party colleagues during a parliamentary panel that the proposal to introduce potential capital sentences for convicted militants would mean “playing along with [the] mind games” of Hamas.\n“And in return we would get pictures of our loved ones murdered, ended, with the state of Israel and not them [Hamas] being blamed for it …. Don’t pursue this until after they are back here,” she said. “Don’t put my sister’s blood on your hands.”\nWhen confronted by relatives of the hostages opposing such a change, far-right politicians shouted that they did not have “a monopoly of pain” in comments that appalled many Israelis.\nAs many as 300 Hamas militants are being held by Israel, military officials have said. Some were involved in the bloody attacks last month, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians in their homes or at a dance party.\nThe Qatari prime minister on Sunday said that only minor differences between Hamas and Israel remained to be resolved, but the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said no deal had been reached.\nNetanyahu is under domestic pressure to free the hostages. The challenge of doing this while completing the goal of eliminating Hamas as a military force capable of striking Israel again has led to disagreements among Israeli policymakers and the security establishment, as well as society more broadly.\nSenior military officers say the two objectives can be reconciled as military pressure on Hamas would lead to concessions over hostages. It is not clear that all Israeli cabinet ministers agree.\nIsraeli media have reported divisions  among senior ministers, with some favouring accepting the deal reportedly tabled by Qatar before international pressure or rising military casualties weaken Israel’s bargaining position. Others argue that Israel should hold out for better terms and that to accept those on offer would set a precedent for future negotiations to obtain the freedom of any remaining hostages.\nUS officials said a hostage deal appeared to be close, but also pointed out that it has appeared close for several days now. It was getting final agreement from the Israeli side, they said, that appeared to be the last hurdle.\nThe White House deputy national security adviser, Jon Finer, on Sunday said any deal to free “considerably more than 12” hostages would be likely to also include an extended pause in the fighting and allow for the distribution of humanitarian assistance in Gaza.\nA staged release would be the first de-escalatory step since Hamas launched its assault on Israel on 7 October. So far, only four hostages have been released. It is thought 239 people from 26 different countries are still being held, including some dual nationals. One Israeli soldier was rescued early in the conflict.\nBen-Gvir’s proposal on capital punishment has moved slowly in parliament. The conservative Likud party of Netanyahu, which depends on support from far-right parties to remain in power, has shown little interest in advancing it during its long rule.\nIsrael’s justice ministry said earlier this month that officials were considering different procedures for putting suspected militants on trial and securing “punishments befitting the severity of the horrors committed”.\nThe hostages have already been threatened with execution by Hamas and are at risk of being hurt or killed in the military offensive launched by Israel. Israeli officials have said that two hostages were murdered by Hamas after being captured, citing forensic examination of their remains found by Israeli troops in northern Gaza.\nThe death penalty remains on Israel’s law books but the only ever court-ordered execution in Israel was that, in 1962, of Adolf Eichmann, a convicted Nazi war criminal who played a central role in the administration of the Holocaust.\nIsraeli military courts, which often handle cases involving Palestinians, have the power to hand down the death penalty by a unanimous decision of three judges, although this has never been implemented.\nHawkish politicians have, over the years, proposed making capital sentences easier to award, claiming executions deter terrorism.\nDoing this was “more critical now than ever”, Ben-Gvir said, “first of all, for the sake of those murdered and who fell in the line of duty and, no less, so that there will be no more people kidnapped.”\nLinor Dan-Calderon, three of whose relatives are hostages, accused Ben-Gvir’s party of having “confused priorities”.\n“You’ve gotten mixed up, because we are a nation that pursues life, not one that pursues revenge – even if, in the past, we did something to Eichmann,” she said. “I am simply asking you to drop this from the agenda.”\nYair Lapid, the leader of the opposition, said the heated argument in parliament on Monday  was “shameful, a disgrace, and a terrible insult not only to the families of hostages but also to the entire state of Israel”.\nLapid said: “This is what happens when you take the craziest and most extreme people in the country and let them be in power.”\nEnd of Document\nYemen’s Houthi rebels seize cargo ship in Red Sea and call Israeli vessels ‘legitimate targets’"," November 20, 2023",2023-11-28

Until I see it, I won’t believe it.”\nSix weeks after the Palestinian militant group’s deadly attack on 7 October, the parents of young hostages abducted by Hamas – Emily Hand, nine; Almog Meir Jan, 21; and Yotam Haim, 28 – pleaded for their return at a press conference in London, as they described their lives as a nightmare.\n“I know the Israeli government and the army will do everything in their capabilities to get them back,” said Hand, whose daughter Emily was initially believed to be among the 1,200 Israelis killed during the surprise attack by Hamas in southern Israel. Now, she is counted among the 240 hostages in Gaza.\nHand said the day of Emily’s ninth birthday, 17 November, which he spent in Times Square surrounded by billboards with her image, was one of his darkest since the attack.\n“My sole purpose in life now is to do everything I can to get my little daughter Emily back,” said Hand, who after living in Be’eri kibbutz for 20 years working in a printing house, now lives in a hotel near the Dead Sea. “Nothing else concerns me.”\nThe emotional plea comes amid the bloodiest chapter in the 75-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, after Israel responded to the Hamas attack with an assault on Gaza that has killed more than 13,000 civilians.\nOn Monday, families in London echoed calls the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has faced from families  to bring the hostages home. Negotiations for their release are under way, possibly in return for a limited ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.\nHamas has released four hostages, and has claimed that as many as 30 have been killed by the Israeli bombing of Gaza. On Sunday, Israel accused Hamas of executing a captive soldier and holding two foreign hostages at al-Shifa hospital, where last week the military said it recovered the body of 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss, a resident of the Be’eri kibbutz who was abducted by Hamas.\nSitting at a table before a backdrop displaying photographs of some of the 240 hostages, including a nine-month-old baby and young children, Iris Haim expressed support for the Israeli military while asking for the world’s support.\n“We hope that they will come back, I trust Israel, I trust the IDF with all my heart but we need the support of the world,” said Haim, the mother of 28-year-old Yotam, who was abducted by Hamas from Kfar Aza. “We need you to support us please.”\nAfter losing contact with her son at 10.44am on 7 October, Haim said the family have had few updates. She has found little comfort, she said, after learning he left his home healthy, walking and unwounded.\nShe added: “Many people want to live together, but we cannot, we cannot make peace with somebody that hates us, that wants to kill us and not just to kill but to slaughter, to be so cruel to innocent people.”\n“In the long-term future, I would love to see peace with our neighbours,” Hand said told the Guardian. “We used to have peace with our neighbours. Before the first intifada, there was true peace. I just hope that they’re taking some reasonable care of Emily and the hostages.”\nEnd of Document\nPalestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha detained by Israelis in Gaza, family says"," November 20, 2023",2023-11-28

"Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha detained by Israelis in Gaza, family says","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-20 22:29:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:3",557," Julian Borger World affairs editor"," The American Book award winner was said to be heading south for the Rafah crossing when he was picked up at a checkpointIsrael-Hamas war – live updates","\nA celebrated Palestinian poet and author, Mosab Abu Toha, has been detained by Israeli forces while trying to leave Gaza, according to his friends and family.\nAbu Toha had been told by US officials that he and his family would be able to cross into Egypt, as one of his children is an American citizen. They were on the way from north to south Gaza, heading for the Rafah crossing point on Sunday, when he was rounded up along with other Palestinian men at an Israeli military checkpoint and taken away.\n“The army took Mosab when he arrived at the checkpoint, leaving from the north to the south, as the army had ordered. The American embassy sent him and his family to go through the Rafah crossing,” the poet’s brother, Hamza, said on social media.  “We have heard nothing from him.”\nA friend of Abu Toha, Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and a former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organization, said: “His son, who was born in America, was cleared to be evacuated a couple of weeks ago, but Mosab’s name was not on the list.”\n“Eventually, they got his name and his wife’s name and the other kids on the list, and they were waiting to get out when it was safe,” Buttu said. “They were trying to evacuate from the north to the south, when they were stopped at a checkpoint with a lot of others. They were told to lift their arms to show they didn’t have anything. Mosab was ordered to put his son down and then the army grabbed him, along with a lot of other men, 200, his wife said. His wife has not heard from him since.”\nNeither the US state department nor the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), responded to requests for comment.\nAbu Toha had been writing in the New Yorker magazine about his experiences under bombardment in Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. A collection of his poetry published in English in the US was a finalist in the National Book Critics Circle award and won an American Book award this year.\n“He’s one of our most prolific writers,” Buttu said. “To be so widely published at such a young age and to have got all these awards and acclaim for his writing, it shows you just how powerful a writer he is.”\n“He’s an incredible poet,” Laura Albast, a Palestinian journalist, editor and friend of Abu Toha, said. “The poetry he writes is very accessible, but it’s also a representation of what happens to us, describing how he rode his bike to try to reach home while the bombs were falling.”\nAbu Toha and his family had taken refuge in Jabalia, where they heard their home in Beit Lahia had been bombed. In a New Yorker article  published on 6 November, he described cycling to the house to try to salvage something from his small book collection.\n“I hope to at least find a copy of my own poetry book, maybe near my neighbor’s olive tree, but there is nothing but debris. Nothing but the smell of explosions,” he wrote.\n“Now I sit in my temporary house in the Jabalia camp, waiting for a ceasefire. I feel like I am in a cage. I’m being killed every day with my people. The only two things I can do are panic and breathe. There is no hope here.”\n“His whereabouts are now unknown,” the New Yorker reported on its website  on Monday night, saying it joined other organisations in calling for his safe return.\n This article was amended on 21 November 2023 to refer to Abu Toha being detained rather than arrested.\nEnd of Document\nWe must fight antisemitism on UK campuses"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28

Other medical staff, including MSF staff, were severely injured, it said.\nMore than 200 patients are still in Al-Awda and must be urgently evacuated to other hospitals in Gaza that are still functioning, MSF said.\nIt said it has regularly shared information about Al-Awda – one of the last remaining functional hospitals in northern Gaza – and that it had shared GPS coordinates with Israeli authorities on Monday. The statement continued:\nWe condemn this strike in the strongest terms and yet again call for the respect and protection of medical facilities, staff and patients.\nAttacks on medical facilities are a “serious violation of international humanitarian law”, it said, adding that such attacks have become “systematic” in the past weeks.\nThis is yet another incident that MSF staff have been subject to in the last few days. Our colleagues who are assisting hundreds of patients in Gaza are facing extremely difficult times in providing the little medical care they can. Seeing doctors killed next to hospital beds is beyond tragic, and this must stop now.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.32pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 5.21pm GMT \n     A medic in Khan Younis attends to an injured Palestinian child evacuated from the Indonesian hospital in the north.

The Unicef spokesperson James Elder said:\nIf youngsters continue to have restricted access to water and sanitation in Gaza, we will see a tragic yet entirely avoidable surge in the number of children dying.\n“The death toll among children is sickening,” he said, noting that more than 5,350 Palestinian children had reportedly been killed, according to Gaza health authorities.\nGrief is becoming embedded in Gaza. So this then is a stark warning: without sufficient fuel, without sufficient water, conditions for children will plummet.\nHe said the daily minimum need in emergency situations was 15 litres of water per person, but that in parts of Gaza as little as three litres a day is available, and none on some days.\nPointing to “a desperate lack of water, faecal matter strewn across densely populated settlements [and] an unacceptable lack of latrines”, Elder said it was a “perfect storm for the spread of disease”.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.06pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.41pm GMT \n At least 52 journalists and media workers have been killed since the Israel-Hamas war began on 7 October, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). \nThe press group updated its death toll  after the news that two journalists  from the Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese channel Al Mayadeen were reportedly killed while working in southern Lebanon on Tuesday.\nThe toll now includes 46 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese killed since 7 October, as well as 11 journalists injured and three missing journalists.\nSherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa programme coordinator, said:\nJournalists across the region are making great sacrifices to cover this heart-breaking conflict. Those in Gaza, in particular, have paid, and continue to pay, an unprecedented toll and face exponential threats. Many have lost colleagues, families, and media facilities, and have fled seeking safety when there is no safe haven or exit.\nblock-time published-time 4.30pm GMT \n Biden says 'very close' to hostage deal  \nThe US president, Joe Biden, has said a deal is “very close” to securing the release of potentially dozens of hostages held by Hamas.\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Biden said:\nWe’re now very close, very close – we can bring some of these hostages home very soon, but don’t want to get into the details of things.\nHe added:\nNothing is done until it’s done and when we have more to say we will, but things are looking good at the moment.\nMeanwhile, a US official told Reuters that Israel and Hamas were “very, very close” to agreeing a deal.\nThe deal would include Hamas releasing 50 hostages, mostly women and children, in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners and a pause of four or five days, the official said.\nWe believe we are very, very close to having a deal. There is still a lot of work to be done, still approval that has to be achieved. But we believe we are very close.\nIt comes as Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has convened his war cabinet  amid growing signs of an imminent deal on the release of hostages.\nNetanyahu is expected to then meet his security cabinet at 7pm local time (5pm GMT) and the full government at 8pm (6pm GMT).\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.45pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.20pm GMT \n     Injured Palestinians, including children, are being taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital for treatment after the Israeli attacks hit the school at Al Bureij Refugee Camp as Israeli attacks continue in Deir Al Balah, Gaza.

South Africa has already cut off diplomatic ties with Israel.\nThe Arab diplomats have been on a tour of capitals of permanent members of the UN security council to gather support for a further UN security council resolution instructing Israel to stop preventing humanitarian aid reaching Gaza. It may also ask for the security council to upgrade the call made on Israel to implement a humanitarian pause to an instruction. Israel immediately rejected a UN security council last week to introduce humanitarian pauses.\nThe delegation started their tour in China before heading to Russia on Tuesday in a sign that the Arab countries now realise they will have to demonstrate to the US president Joe Biden he cannot take an Arab-US alliance for granted if he continues to provide such strong support to Israel.\nIt is also expected that some members of the delegation will visit France and the UK.

Qatar foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari said “we are at the closest point we ever had been in reaching an agreement”, adding that negotiations were at a “critical and final stage”.It is reported that the deal would involve a multi-day pause in hostilities, the release of about 50 civilian hostages by Hamas and the release of Palestinian women and children held in Israeli custody.  Any agreement would mark the biggest hostage release and first prisoner swap since the 7 October Hamas attack inside Israel. To date just four of the estimated 240 people seized and abducted into Gaza have been returned to Israel. Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir issued a statement this morning warning against a deal.Israel’s air force has said on social media that in the last 24 hours it has “struck approximately 250 Hamas terror targets”.  The Israeli military also issued a video of its troops in action within the Gaza Strip, claiming that “division 162 completed the encirclement of Jabalia tonight and is ready for the continuation of the attack”.The Al-Mayadeen news channel has accused Israel of a direct attack on its journalists, after correspondent Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih Maamari were killed on Tuesday while working in the south of Lebanon, near the UN-marked boundary with Israel.  “It was a direct attack, it was not by chance,” AFP reports Bin Jiddo said in an interview on the channel, noting it came after an Israeli government decision this month to block access to the website of Al-Mayadeen.

But what was supposed to be a joyful holiday, became a waking nightmare.\nWhen Israeli military officials issued a sweeping evacuation order for nearly half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people to move south or else risk being killed, the Abushaabans initially sought shelter at the Khan Younis refugee camp.\nBut as the siege continued, conditions became increasingly grim. Food, water and electricity became scarce and all the while Israel was still bombing Gaza from the land, sea and air.\nThe Abushaabans’ only connection to the outside world was via WhatsApp – and only when there was limited access to the internet. The communication blackouts in the territory meant they had to decide each day whether to call Kari to discuss their attempts to escape, or dial their family, knowing that any conversation might be their last.\n Read more of Erum Salam’s report here: ‘Why can’t I get them out?’: Palestinian Americans who fled Gaza devastated over leaving family behind\n Related:  ‘Why can’t I get them out?’: Palestinian Americans who fled Gaza devastated over leaving family behind\nblock-time published-time 12.16pm GMT \n Reuters has a quick snap that Lebanese media is reporting an Israeli strike on a car inside Lebanon, near Tyre, has killed four people. \nEarlier Lebanon’s Al-Mayadeen television said two of its staff were killed in an Israeli attack in the south of the country today.

(One of those prisoners was Sinwar himself.)\nBy its refusal to accept a deal before now, Israel has kept that leverage to a minimum. “But once that path is taken, Hamas can play that card much more effectively,” Levy said. “They’re not going to roll over for the release of the rest of the prisoners – they’re going to demand as much as they possibly can for each one.”\nOne reason for Netanyahu’s resistance to a deal may be his understanding that once the war comes to an end, his own position will come under far more urgent scrutiny because of a wide consensus that the failure to protect civilians near the Gaza border was his responsibility. “He is almost certainly toast the morning after the war is over,” said Levy. “The same is probably true of the military leadership, so they have not played the moderating role that they might ordinarily be expected to.”\n Read more here: Tuesday briefing – How a deal that could mean a truce in Gaza became possible\n Related:  Tuesday briefing: How a deal that could mean a truce in Gaza became possible\nSign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.36am GMT\nblock-time published-time 7.08am GMT \n Israel’s military has issued its latest update on the operational situation, and has said that it is “operating against terrorist infrastructure and operatives in the Jabalia area in the northern Gaza Strip”. \nIn the update posted to social media and to the Telegram messaging app, the IDF claimed “during the battle, the division struck three tunnel shafts in the area of Jabalia, in which terrorists were hiding” and that “troops killed dozens of terrorists with air support, captured enemy weapons in various locations, including private houses and children’s bedrooms, and located and destroyed tunnel shafts.”\nThe claims have not been independently verified. \nThis is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Certainly not while prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu  was in charge. He was, as his acolytes put it, “Mr Security”. He wanted to be remembered, he said, as “the protector of Israel”. He boasted that Israel had never known a more peaceful and prosperous time than the roughly 16 years he has been in power. It was under his successive administrations that Israel installed the Iron Dome system to intercept rockets from the Gaza Strip, and constructed, along the Gaza border, a 40-mile, $1.1bn fence, equipped with underground sensors, remote-controlled weapons and an expansive camera system. The success of Netanyahu’s vision of Fortress Israel could be measured in the imperceptibility of the Palestinians and their suffering from the comfort of a Tel Aviv cafe.\nBut the relative calm of the last decade-and-a-half was built upon a series of illusions: that the Palestinians and their aspirations for freedom could be hidden behind concrete barriers and ignored; that any remaining resistance could be managed through a combination of technology and overwhelming firepower; that the world, and especially Sunni Arab states, had grown so tired of the Palestinian issue that it could be removed from the global agenda, and consequently, that Israeli governments could do as they pleased and suffer few consequences.\n Related:  The Netanyahu doctrine: how Israel’s longest-serving leader reshaped the country in his image\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.12am GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.50am GMT \nMeanwhile Al Jazeera reports that Israeli forces have struck communications towers in Gaza City and northern Gaza, cutting off communications.

The death toll, published by Gaza’s government media office on Monday, includes 5,600 children and 3,550 women.Israeli forces continued their offensive against Hamas in northern Gaza, closing in on the Indonesian hospital where thousands of patients and displaced people have been sheltering for weeks.  The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “appalled”  by reports that 12 people, including patients, were killed in overnight shelling at the last hospital operating in northern Gaza. Some 200 patients have been evacuated  from the Indonesian hospital on Monday, Gaza’s health ministry has said.The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that health services in Gaza have suffered “catastrophic” damage, with most hospitals no longer functioning. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies programme, warned that the thousands of injuries sustained by civilians across Gaza, combined with the growing public health crisis  in the besieged enclave,  is a “recipe for epidemics”.  He also described Israel’s cooperation for humanitarian relief in Gaza as “subpar”. The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said a clinic it operated in Gaza City was attacked on Monday morning.  Part of the building was engulfed in flames, it said, and four marked MSF cars were burned while a fifth was found crushed by a heavy vehicle or a tank. The charity said  it was not immediately aware of the status of one member of staff and 20 family members.Twenty-eight premature babies were rescued  from al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City and taken to Egypt on Monday. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said 31 “very sick” babies were moved from al-Shifa hospital in a joint operation with the UN and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, and 12 of them had been flown to Cairo.  Three babies remain in Gaza.Israel and Hamas appear to be edging towards a deal that would see the release of a significant number of hostages,possibly in return  for a limited ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Joe Biden on Monday said he believed a deal is near , and the White House later said the US is “doing everything we can” and that it believed “we’re closer than we’ve ever been”. Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas have clashed with far-right Israeli politicians who want to bring in the death penalty as a possible sentence for captured Hamas members. The families said on Monday  that even talk of doing so might endanger the lives of their relatives. The row  underlines the deep divisions in Israel over how to deal with the hostage crisis.The UN secretary general has said it is clear that the war in Gaza has seen “a killing of civilians that is unparalleled and unprecedented  in any conflict” since he began his role in 2017. At a press conference on Monday, António Guterres also said he did not believe a UN protectorate in Gaza would be a solution to the conflict and that war must “move in a determined, irreversible way to a two-state solution”. Relief trucks originally from Jordan entered Gaza from Egypt on Monday with the intention of setting up a new field hospitalin the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. Jordanian state media said it hoped the facility  would help ease some of the humanitarian crisis as Israel’s forces seize medical facilities in the north.Yemen’s Houthi rebels said they have seized what they called an Israeli cargo ship in the Red Sea, and warned that all vessels linked to Israel “will become a legitimate target for armed forces”.  They have since released video footage reportedly  showing armed men seizing a ship. Israel said the vessel was a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo ship.\nEnd of Document\nCanadian writers ask Giller prize to drop charges against pro-Palestinian protesters"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28
"The Netanyahu doctrine: how Israel’s longest-serving leader reshaped the country in his image","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 05:00:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",5348," Joshua Leifer"," He first became prime minister in 1996, and has been pushing the country further right ever since. Most agree his political days are numbered – but the approach he established will prove very difficult to shift","\nAn attack like Hamas’s 7 October massacre was not supposed to have been possible. Certainly not while prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in charge. He was, as his acolytes put it, “Mr Security”. He wanted to be remembered, he said, as “the protector of Israel”. He boasted that Israel had never known a more peaceful and prosperous time than the roughly 16 years he has been in power. It was under his successive administrations that Israel installed the Iron Dome system to intercept rockets from the Gaza Strip, and constructed, along the Gaza border, a 40-mile, $1.1bn fence, equipped with underground sensors, remote-controlled weapons and an expansive camera system. The success of Netanyahu’s vision of Fortress Israel could be measured in the imperceptibility of the Palestinians and their suffering from the comfort of a Tel Aviv cafe.\nBut the relative calm of the last decade-and-a-half was built upon a series of illusions: that the Palestinians and their aspirations for freedom could be hidden behind concrete barriers and ignored; that any remaining resistance could be managed through a combination of technology and overwhelming firepower; that the world, and especially Sunni Arab states, had grown so tired of the Palestinian issue that it could be removed from the global agenda, and consequently, that Israeli governments could do as they pleased and suffer few consequences.\nThe attack on 7 October shattered all these presumptions. Hamas gunmen on motorbikes and the backs of pickup trucks sailed through the “smart” barrier that cost more than the entire GDP of Grenada. Caught off guard, Israel’s army appeared almost immobilised, unable to regain control of some towns  and kibbutzim for more than 48 hours. Every aspect of Netanyahu’s project collapsed on the Saturday morning Israelis have taken to calling “the black shabbat”.\nSuccessive Netanyahu governments did not make Israelis safer. Instead, they made them vulnerable to attacks such as the one Hamas carried out. Netanyahu did not chart a path for Israel out of its dependence on the United States. Instead, he left Israel as dependent on its US backer as it was during the only comparable disaster in Israel’s history, the 1973 Yom Kippur war. Netanyahu promised to streamline the state and make government more efficient. Instead, Israel’s bureaucracy has been hollowed out, its social services underfunded and unresponsive.\nAnd yet, while Netanyahu’s vision for Israel has been utterly discredited, there is no clear successor poised to break with it. The iron tracks that Netanyahu laid may prove too hard to shift. The current crisis may very well mark the end of Netanyahu’s public career. But Israel may also be trapped in conditions of his making long after he is gone.\n                   * * *                   \nOn a dark October night in 1995, Netanyahu stood  on a balcony overlooking Jerusalem’s Zion Square. A banner reading “Death to Arabs” had been unfurled before him. An inflamed crowd of tens of thousands stood below him. Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister at the time, was pushing for a negotiated settlement with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and this was a protest organised by the Oslo Accords’ rightwing opponents. At the time, Netanyahu was the 46-year-old elected leader of Israel’s rightwing Likud party. He was widely seen as a brash new face in a tired political scene still dominated by veterans of Israel’s founding.\nA savvy political operator, Netanyahu had staked his political future on opposing the Oslo peace process. That summer, he had joined a demonstration that featured a mock funeral procession for Rabin, replete with a coffin and a noose, where protesters chanted “Death to Rabin”. In the streets of Jerusalem that October night, demonstrators brandished signs denouncing Rabin as a traitor. They held aloft pictures of him in the uniform of the Nazi SS, and in PLO chair Yasser Arafat’s keffiyeh. They chanted “in blood and fire we will expel Rabin”, and, again, “Death to Rabin”.\nOne month later, a religious nationalist law student named Yigal Amir fired two shots into Rabin’s back, killing him and the vision of territorial compromise he represented. Outside the hospital where Rabin’s death was announced, a crowd of the prime minister’s supporters chanted “Bibi is a murderer”. It was, of course, Amir who pulled the trigger. But Netanyahu was among the most prominent figures who had fuelled the atmosphere of violence in which Amir did the deed.\nIn 1996, the Labor party leader and Rabin’s successor, Shimon Peres, called elections in the hope of reaffirming a popular mandate for the Oslo peace process. According to the polls, it was a safe bet. Netanyahu’s popularity had begun to flag in the aftermath of Rabin’s assassination. But after a string of suicide bombings in the months before the May elections, Netanyahu’s fortunes began to improve. He hammered Peres on the perils of territorial compromise, framed his dovish opponent as weak and warned that Peres “would divide Jerusalem”. By a threadbare margin – less than 1% of the vote – Netanyahu staged a surprise upset. He became the youngest prime minister in Israel’s history.\nNetanyahu’s first three-year term was not a success, but many of the hallmarks of his approach were already evident. Pressed by the Clinton administration to advance peace negotiations, Netanyahu strung the Americans along, committing only to the bare minimum required to keep the peace process alive, while doing everything possible to prevent a final status agreement in the long run. In the eyes of his rightwing critics, Netanyahu did not break decisively enough with the two-state solution. As Netanyahu saw it, however, the best way to prevent a Palestinian state was to do so quietly, without the fanfare that formal annexation or direct rejection of the US-led peace process would have entailed.\nNetanyahu is not a conventional ideologue. His opposition to a two-state solution does not derive from any messianic conviction or biblical inspiration. While many of his supporters are religious traditionalists, he is staunchly secular and doesn’t even keep kosher.  Instead, his worldview is shaped by deep pessimism. “I’m asked if we will for ever live by the sword – yes,” he told a group of Knesset members in 2015. He had absorbed this view as a child. His father, Benzion Netanyahu, was a dyspeptic historian of the Spanish Inquisition who died in 2012, at the age of 102. “ Jewish history is in large measure a history of holocausts ,” Netanyahu Sr  once told the New Yorker’s David Remnick. For Netanyahu the son, that catastrophic vision of history has meant that nearly all matters of defence appear refracted through the lens of existential threat. According to such calculus, any Palestinian state would almost certainly devolve into an Islamist terror state threatening Israel’s existence; therefore indefinite Israeli control over the occupied territories is an absolute necessity for Jewish survival.\nNetanyahu combined this bleak worldview with a mastery of the art of political presentation. He was Israel’s first real TV prime minister. He took acting classes to perfect his public performances. He wore makeup and made sure the cameras only showed his good side. At a time when most other Israeli politicians still favoured rolled-up shirt sleeves, Netanyahu appeared in bold Brioni suits, and this taste for luxury, too, would remain throughout his years in power.\nA former special forces commando turned management consultant, Netanyahu embodied the new Israeli synthesis of hawkish neoliberalism. He was, at once, a technocrat and a populist. In 1996, he arrived in office with elaborate plans to remake the Israeli economy along Thatcherite free-market lines: restructuring of the country’s bureaucracy, liberalising the labour market; cutting subsidies for struggling industries. He accomplished little of this programme. More significant were the changes he brought to the country’s political culture. Ever since Menachem Begin’s premiership in the 1970s, Likud had used the rhetoric of class resentment and religious traditionalism to mobilise its base of largely working-class Mizrahim, Jews of Middle Eastern and north African origin. Netanyahu sharpened Likud’s populism for the age of the soundbite. His supporters rallied behind the slogan “Netanyahu – good for the Jews”, which implied that his opponents were disloyal to Jewish interests.\nAfter he returned to power in 2009, Netanyahu vowed never to lose it. As Israeli journalist Ben Caspit details in his book, The Netanyahu Years, Netanyahu crushed or expelled any potential rivals within Likud. By 2015, he had “metamorphosed”, Haaretz editor Aluf Benn wrote, “from a risk-averse conservative into a rightwing radical”. He transformed a party that, while always staunchly and even violently nationalist, had once included economic and social liberals into an authoritarian populist party centred on his charismatic personality. Encouraged by his wife, Sara, and his son, Yair, Netanyahu also began to think of himself as indispensable, as the incarnation of the national spirit, as identical to the state itself. “Without Bibi,” Sara Netanyahu has repeatedly said, “Israel is doomed.”\n                   * * *                   \nOver his long years in power, a distinct “Netanyahu model” of politics emerged. When it came to the issue of the Palestinians, Netanyahu’s core belief was that the occupation could be managed and maintained indefinitely. In theory, Netanyahu suggested that he would be willing to accept the “demilitarised” Palestinian state that he described in a 2009 speech at Bar-Ilan University.  Yet in practice, as he outlined in the same speech, the conditions under which he would agree to such a state were ones that no Palestinian leader could ever accept: not just demilitarisation and Israeli security control over airspace, but also an Israeli capital in an undivided Jerusalem. It was a bluff to keep the illusion of a peace process alive while further entrenching the occupation.\nNetanyahu’s belief that the occupation could remain in perpetuity was, and is, widely shared. The Israeli centre-right’s leading intellectual, the philosopher Micah Goodman, gave the idea of occupation-management a respectable patina of pragmatism in his 2018 book Catch-67.  Rather than hoping to “solve” the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Goodman suggested that it might be “minimised” – for instance, by expanding areas of limited Palestinian autonomy while maintaining ultimate Israeli dominance in the occupied West Bank.\nEven Netanyahu’s political opponents have embraced this approach. The short-lived “change” government led by the former TV host Yair Lapid and settler leader Naftali Bennett, which briefly deposed Netanyahu in the spring of 2021, did not deviate from the Netanyahu model, but deepened it further. It was under the Lapid-Bennett government when Palestinian casualties in the West Bank began to spike. This was also the period when Benny Gantz, at the time minister of defence, designated six leading Palestinian human rights NGOs “terrorist organisations” as part of Israel’s efforts to quash opposition to the occupation.\nTo its proponents, the occupation-management paradigm had numerous practical advantages. Maintaining the status quo lowered the risk of enraging the international community. Indefinite yet putatively temporary occupation also enabled Israel to keep the Palestinians disenfranchised, whereas formal annexation would require Israel to decide whether to grant Palestinians in the annexed territories citizenship and, from Israel’s point of view, risk jeopardising the Jewish demographic majority.\nYet for Netanyahu and his allies, it was not enough simply to entrench the occupation; it was also necessary to guarantee that no unified Palestinian movement might arise. The way to do that, according to Netanyahu, was to strengthen the Islamist Hamas in Gaza at the expense of its rival, the Fatah-dominated PLO in the West Bank. To prop up the Hamas government in Gaza, at Israel’s request, the Qatari government transferred billions of dollars to the militant group. “Anyone who wants to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state needs to support strengthening Hamas,” said Netanyahu  at a Likud party meeting in 2019. “This is part of our strategy, to divide the Palestinians between those in Gaza and those in Judea and Samaria.”\nWhat Israelis call “the conceptzia” – this paradigm of occupation-management and divide-and-rule – had its counterpart in the realm of foreign policy. Until 2020, the only Arab states to sign treaties with Israel were Egypt and Jordan. That changed when the Trump administration underwrote the 2020 Abraham Accords , the series of normalisation agreements between Israel and the Gulf States of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco and, later, Sudan.  It is not a coincidence that Hamas launched its attack just as Israel and Saudi Arabia appeared to be getting closer to normalising relations. Even after the current devastating war, Israel and the Saudis may very well press on with this process, but it remains as clear as ever that long-term regional stability – and Israeli security – will depend on ending the occupation and realising Palestinian national aspirations.\nFrom the perspective of Israel’s right, regional integration also provided an alternative safety net as the US turned its focus away from the Middle East and toward Asia. As one Israeli politician, a member of Avigdor Liberman’s rightwing secularist Yisrael Beitenu party told me in the summer of 2022, “the declining stature” of the US in world affairs necessitated closer ties between Israel and other countries in the region. “People understand that they need to hang on to each other,” he said.\nA Middle East where the US played a less active role had also long been a dream of Israeli hawks, who view Israeli reliance on the US as a constraint and strategic liability. In 1996, a group of neoconservative thinktankers lead by Richard Perle, who would later join the George W Bush administration, published a paper titled A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm , which outlined steps for how Israel under Netanyahu could “forge a new basis for relations with the United States”. According to the authors, Israel could gain “greater freedom of action and remove a significant lever of pressure against it” if it was able to “cut itself free” from US support by “liberalising its economy”.\nTo a large extent, Netanyahu’s successive administrations followed this strategy. Aggressive privatisations of banks and utilities, tax cuts and sharp decreases on public spending, and anti-union measures did transform Israel from a middling, state-dominated economy into an affluent, military- and surveillance-tech exporting regional power, even as inequality within Israel deepened. Under Netanyahu – first as finance minister in Ariel Sharon’s government, then during his second stint as prime minister – Israel reversed  its longstanding trade deficit and began to accumulate vast foreign currency reserves. The stronger Israel became economically, the less it required direct economic grant aid from the US, which ceased in 2008.  Even US military aid to Israel, though it still amounts to the enormous sum of $38bn, mostly comes in the form of a discount  for Israeli purchases of US arms and missile-defence funding – essentially a subsidy to US arms manufactures.\nIn the 2010s, Netanyahu began to turn away from the US and its allies and cultivate relationships with proudly illiberal states such as Viktor Orbán’s Hungary and Poland under the rule of outgoing leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski as a means of blocking potential measures against Israel by the European Union. He boasted of his good working relationship with Russia’s Vladmir Putin – 2019 Likud election campaign posters showed Netanyahu shaking hands with Putin  –and throughout Russian’s war on Ukraine, Israel has refused to supply missile defence systems to Ukraine and has kept criticism of Russian conduct to a minimum. Ever wary of US decline, Israel has also developed closer ties with China. In 2021, as part of China’s belt and road initiative, Israel granted  the state-owned Shanghai International Port Group a tender to operate the Haifa Bay Port shipping terminal, which manages roughly half of the country’s freight. Chinese companies have also worked on major Israeli infrastructure projects, such as the new Tel Aviv light rail system.\nIn Israel’s domestic sphere, Netanyahu developed a distinct mode of personalistic rule. He granted ministerial and government agency positions to Likud apparatchiks and yes-men, unknowns and incompetents whose only credential seemed to be their loyalty to him. In 2020, after he was indicted in several corruption cases, charged with  bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu’s political style became increasingly paranoid. In a pre-trial speech , he declared: “Elements in the police and the prosecution have joined forces with the leftist media – I call them the ‘anyone but Bibi’ gang – to manufacture baseless cases against me.” This marked the crystallisation of what some Israeli commentators named “Bibism” – a synthesis of bellicose nationalism, conspiracy theorising and, above all else, the denunciation of Netanyahu’s opponents as traitors.\nAs more of the electorate turned against him, Netanyahu maintained a governing coalition by elevating extremist settlers and messianic ethno-nationalists to positions of power within his government. These included figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir , now minister of national security, who has previously been convicted of incitement to racism and terrorism, who as a young far-right militant had been part of a group that assaulted Yitzhak Rabin’s motorcade, and who, until recently, hung on his living room wall a picture of Baruch Goldstein, a Brooklyn-born Israeli settler who massacred 29 Palestinians at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron. As part of coalition negotiations last winter, Netanyahu transferred authority  over the military government in the West Bank to finance minister and hardline religious nationalist Bezalel Smotrich, who has called for the formal annexation of the West Bank and the expulsion of any Palestinians who resist.\nOnce invested with authority, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich began to push immediately for the annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank, implementing land-grab measures and approving unbridled settlement expansion, which culminated, even before the current war, in making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians since the second intifada. Between 1 January and 6 October , the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs recorded at least 199 Palestinian fatalities in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the highest figure since 2005.\n                   * * *                   \nHamas’s incursion on the morning of 7 October demolished each of the prongs of Netanyahu’s project. The scale and cruelty of the assault demonstrated the impossibility of maintaining the occupation for ever without continuous, devastating loss of life. For most of the past two decades, it was the Palestinians who bore the vast majority of this human cost, and those years lulled Israel into a dangerous complacency and indifference toward the fates of their Palestinian neighbours. The Hamas leadership recognised this vulnerability and exploited it to murderous effect.\nWhile it will take time to grasp fully the extent of the Israeli intelligence failure, what has emerged so far is that military officials ignored what should have been warning signs. According to Haaretz, Israel intelligence stopped listening  to Hamas walkie-talkie chatter months before the attacks. On a recent TV interview, a 20-year-old soldier from the 7th armoured brigade said his unit had received reports of unusual activity at about 11pm the night of 6 October but were issued no follow-up command. At about 3am, Ronen Bar, director of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service, received a call  in response to such reports. After hours of deliberation in the early morning, he sent only a small special forces team to the Gaza separation-fence area. Convinced that Hamas had been pacified, deterred and integrated into the Israeli apparatus of occupation-management, Israel’s generals did not take seriously that Hamas could carry out an attack of such magnitude.\nThe attacks also revealed with terrifying clarity the strategic risk posed by the ongoing settlement enterprise in the West Bank. One reason why Hamas gunmen managed to overwhelm Israeli defences, and why it took so long for Israeli forces to retake the towns and kibbutzim that had been overrun, was that much of Israel’s army had been sent to the West Bank. That weekend was the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah – under normal circumstances a time of joy and dancing, but in the occupied West Bank, a time of heightened settler violence. The Israeli army had even relocated forces away from the Gaza border to the West Bank, to guard Israeli settlers. In total, 32 IDF battalions had deployed to the occupied West Bank, while just two battalions deployed along the Gaza border. This left the kibbutzim and towns of the western Negev – the citizens of Israel proper – vulnerable, while West Bank settlers could terrorise the Palestinian population under IDF cover. Advocates of settlement-building have long claimed that their efforts bolstered Israel’s security. Reality has proven their argument wrong.\nNetanyahu’s failures in the realm of foreign relations are no less stark. Contrary to his long-held view, the question of Palestine will not simply go away. No real Israeli integration into the broader Middle East will be possible without a long-term agreement that ends the occupation of the West Bank and the siege of the Gaza Strip. The current war has frayed Israel’s relations with Egypt and Jordan, its two most crucial Arab allies. With the help of the US, the Israeli government has attempted to pressure the Egyptian government into taking Gazans into Egyptian territory, a move that reflects a reckless disregard for the stability of their south-west neighbour. Egyptian authorities have so far refused. Massive protests have broken out not only in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, but also in Turkey. The Abraham Accords, which Netanyahu took to be his epochal achievement, have also shown signs of strain. In early November, Bahrain recalled  its ambassador from Israel and announced that it had suspended economic ties to show support for the Palestinian cause.\nAbove all, the ostensible “self-reliance” that Netanyahu achieved has proved to be a farce. Amid the threat of a broader regional war, Israel now appears more dependent than ever on its US sponsor, which has moved two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East to deter regional escalation of the conflict. The US provides Israel with everything from small arms, such as automatic rifles, to key components of the Iron Dome system. It even sent  three-star general James Glynn of the US Marines to advise the Israeli general staff on how to conduct urban counterinsurgency. In an unprecedented display of US involvement, secretary of state Antony Blinken and secretary of defense Lloyd Austin have both sat in on Israeli security cabinet planning meetings to counsel their Israeli counterparts.\nWithin Israel, the incompetent response to 7 October has exposed the toll Netanyahu’s long rule has taken on the state. For days, and in some cases weeks, after the attacks, some families reported that they had heard nothing from government officials about the whereabouts of their missing relatives; daytime TV anchors stepped in to create hotlines for those desperate for information. On the day of the attacks, when dozens of police were killed, Ben-Gvir, whose office oversees the police, was nowhere to be found; only later did he emerge, not to take responsibility for what had happened, but to stage photo-ops of himself distributing assault rifles to civilian defence units in Israeli cities. State efforts to relocate, feed and clothe the tens of thousands of Israelis evacuated from the northern and southern borders were so ineffectual that protest groups, which had formed during the demonstrations against the government’s judicial overhaul plan, stepped in to fill the void. Budget cuts to the ministry of health have created a shortage of state-funded social workers and psychologists to handle the thousands of people in need of treatment for trauma.\nFor his part, Netanyahu seems to be managing the crisis with his increasingly dim political future in mind. As ever, his concern is optics. He has not attended a single funeral for those killed on 7 October, presumably out of fear that attendees might accost him. He has favoured broadcast addresses and staged photo-ops with elite military units. When he finally met with representatives of the families of those taken hostage, a far-right activist with no known ties to any hostages, but with close ties to the Netanyahu family, just happened to suddenly appear  at the meeting to praise him. Having already attempted to blame military and intelligence officials for the 7 October disaster, Netanyahu is now busy collecting evidence  to exculpate himself when, after the war, he finally faces a reckoning.\n                   * * *                   \nDespite such efforts at image rehabilitation, Netanyahu is all but finished politically. The public’s anger towards him and his government is immense. In a recent survey conducted by Israel’s Channel 13 News, 76% of respondents  said Netanyahu needs to resign – either at the end of the war (47%) or immediately (29%). During a recent interview with the Israeli liberal daily Haaretz, the former defence minister Moshe Ya’alon, a man whose political views are to Netanyahu’s right, called the prime minister “an existential threat” to the country. Another poll found that less than 4% of Israelis believe Netanyahu is a reliable source of information about the current war.\nWhat comes after Netanyahu? Before 7 October, his attempt to dismantle the country’s judiciary had sparked the largest protest movement  in Israel’s history. For more than nine months, hundreds of thousands took to the streets in an attempt to stave off a reactionary constitutional revolution that would have made it almost impossible for the right to lose power. These protests revitalised Israeli civil society, which had shrivelled over the course of Netanyahu’s tenure. The perceived threat of an Orbán- or Erdogan-style autocracy has re-politicised and, in some cases, even radicalised segments of Israel’s liberal, secular, educated middle classes. Any new political force that might not just challenge Netanyahu the man, but also break with his policies, will probably emerge out of this movement.\nStill, what remains of Israel’s left finds itself in a difficult place. The last few years of repeated elections – there have been five since 2019 – devastated the Labor Zionist parties that once dominated Israeli political life. The Labor party itself has been reduced to just four parliamentary seats. Meretz, the civil libertarian, social-democratic party that long represented the country’s peace camp has no seats. Since 7 October, Yair Golan , a 61-year-old former IDF general and erstwhile Meretz chairman has become something of a national celebrity after he donned his uniform and rescued civilians under Hamas attack; for the time being, he is the Israeli centre-left’s last, best hope to bring a negotiated compromise with the Palestinians back to the Israeli mainstream – but it is an extremely remote possibility.\nIsrael’s public discourse has lurched much further to the right. TV news amplifies the calls for revenge and the use of disproportionate force, even as the death toll in Gaza rises into the tens of thousands. Each day, another Likud politician or government minister emerges to call unashamedly for war crimes. Agriculture minister Avi Dichter appeared  on television last week to urge on the “Gaza Nakba”, as he described Israel’s current ground operation. Deputy speaker of the Knesset, Nissim Vaturi, tweeted that Israel should  “Burn Gaza now, nothing less!” Earlier this month, the minister of heritage, Amihai Eliyahu suggested Israel could drop  drop a nuclear bomb on the Gaza Strip. Some Israeli pop stars have begun  to sing of conquering and rebuilding Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. Though the political leaders of the settler right, such as Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, have been discredited, the veteran pollster Dudi Hasid recently observed that there might be space even further to their right awaiting to be filled. Netanyahu and his government have said that the aim of the war is to topple Hamas; Israel’s almost inevitable failure to fully meet this goal could, in fact, generate an increased ethno-nationalist backlash.\nThe most likely possibility, however, is that the Netanyahu project persists in the absence of the man himself. The most probable successor to Netanyahu is his closest rival of several years, Benny Gantz, the former IDF chief and leader of the centre-right National Unity party, whose ratings  have skyrocketed in the past six weeks. The tall, blue-eyed Gantz presents an image of martial rectitude compared to Netanyahu’s mafioso-populism. Yet Gantz is less an ideological alternative to Netanyahu than a cosmetic one. A loyal soldier for his entire life, he has known nothing other than the occupation-management paradigm, and would probably maintain it. Polling just behind Gantz, former prime minister Naftali Bennett also appears poised for a bid at power. Bennett – who once served as Netanyahu’s chief of staff – would also probably stick to the Netanyahu playbook.\nFor years, Netanyahu has imagined himself  as the Middle East’s Winston Churchill. The Israeli journalist Ari Shavit has observed that Netanyahu sees himself not simply as battling threats to Israel’s existence, but as a frontline defender of the west against its mortal enemies. Since the start of the current war, Netanyahu’s grandiose illusions have been on display. “We are sons of light, they are sons of darkness,” he recently declared.  Yet it is, at least in part, this very pessimism – the worldview in which it is always 1933 – that has doomed Israel under Netanyahu to endless wars – seven since he assumed power in 2009 – and condemned the Palestinians in Gaza to repeated bombardment.\nAny break with the Netanyahu paradigm will require moving beyond the mentality according to which Israel’s existence hangs ever in the balance – a task that, after the massacres of 7 October, will be much more difficult. But as Israeli security officials will freely acknowledge, this ghastly war, even with its threat of turning into multi-front conflagration, is not an existential war for Israel. If there is to be any hope of undoing the Netanyahu legacy, it will come from an Israeli leader, perhaps one whose name is not yet known, with the courage to acknowledge frankly Israel’s strength and use it as a basis for a renewed push for peace.\nFor now, however, there are no such candidates. Netanyahu has reshaped the country in his image; he has led the country for longer than David Ben-Gurion, the country’s founding father. Even after Netanyahu the man is gone, his legacy discredited, the mould he set will prove difficult to shatter. \n  The best stories take time.

"Israel-Hamas war is deadliest conflict on record for reporters, says watchdog","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 06:00:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",966," Robert Tait in Washington"," The IDF’s offensive in Gaza has killed 48 members of the press and caused a ‘news blackout’, says Committee to Protect Journalists","\nIsrael’s military offensive in Gaza has produced the deadliest month for journalists since statistics began more than three decades ago, and created a news blackout in the embattled territory, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said.\nThe reporters’ watchdog has recorded the deaths of 48 reporters since Hamas embarked on a murderous killing spree in Israel on 7 October, triggering a concerted Israeli bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza in response.\nThe committee had already labelled the first month after the Hamas attacks as the most lethal suffered by journalists since 1992 before six more Palestinian journalists were killed in Gaza over the weekend.\nFive were killed on Saturday alone, making it the second deadliest of the war apart from the day of Hamas’ attack, when six journalists lost their lives.\nThe spiralling death toll over a six-week period compares with the 42 journalists killed worldwide in the whole of 2022, including 15 who died covering Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, widely considered a highly dangerous conflict for news media.\nThe CPJ says the lethal trend also far outstrips the 30 journalists killed at the height of the Syrian civil war, previously regarded as the deadliest war zone for journalists in recent times.\nNow the organisation has issued an urgent plea to Israel and its western allies to reform the rules of engagement deployed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to prohibit the use of lethal force against journalists bearing press insignia.\nSherif Mansour, the committee’s coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, said the rising number of media fatalities combined with successive cuts to internet and phone networks , and tightening censorship, were effectively imposing an information blackout on Gaza, a tiny coastal territory that is home to an estimated 2.3 million Palestinians. It meant a dearth of information for a population desperate to know where to obtain food, fuel and clean water, he said.\n“Reporting the conflict has become so much more dangerous because of the exponential risk to local Palestinian journalists who are on the frontline and have no safe haven and no way out,” Mansour said.\n“Also the Israeli army has refused to take any responsibility for the killings, saying to the international media organisations that they cannot guarantee the safety of the media or their employees.\n“We have said, especially after the army targeted communications facilities, that we have reached a news blackout. We also have the problems with censorship, assaults and detentions in the West Bank.”\nNinety percent of the journalists killed have been Palestinians, with the exception of four Israeli reporters killed in the Hamas attacks, and one Lebanese citizen. The majority of the Palestinians killed have been freelancers and photo-journalists.\n“They are the most needed right now but they are also the most vulnerable,” said Mansour.\nAnother nine journalists have been injured and a further three are missing. Thirteen have been arrested as part of what is described as an Israeli “censorship regime” introduced under emergency legislation making it an offence to damage “national morale” or “national security”.\nIt is unclear how many journalists were covering the conflict at the times of their deaths. But the CPJ is investigating each instance to see if reporters were caught in the crossfire while trying to do their jobs, Mansour added.\nThe grim tally has prompted the committee to renew calls initially made before the outbreak of the latest hostilities for Israel to reform its rules of engagement so that clearly identified journalists are protected.\n“Last May, we said the IDF must change their rules of engagement to stop unleashing the use of lethal forces against journalists and media organisations,” said Mansour, who cited a previous CPJ report, Deadly Pattern, which said 13 out 20 journalists killed in Gaza before the current war had been wearing or carrying press markings at the time.\n“We have not seen any indication that this has been done. This time, therefore, we have also called on Israel’s allies, including the United States, Britain and other European countries to pressure it to stop any use of lethal force against journalists.”\nThe call for protective measures follows claims this month by an Israeli media advocacy group, HonestReporting, that some international media outlets knew about Hamas’s 7 October attack in advance , citing the publication of pictures taken by local journalists showing the group storming into Israeli territory.\nHonestReporting subsequently withdrew the accusations in the face of the organisations’ denials but not before the office of Benjamin Netanyahu , the Israeli prime minister, issued a statement calling journalists who had photographed the event accomplices in “crimes against humanity”. Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet, said they should be treated as terrorists and hunted down.\nDays after the report, the home of Yasser Qudih, a freelance photographer who provided pictures of the Hamas attack to Reuters, was struck by four missiles. Qudih survived the strike but eight members of his family were killed. It is unclear whether Israel launched the strike.\nMansour called the HonestReporting claim a “smear campaign” that put Palestinian journalists’ lives in danger and said it was consistent with previous “false narratives” implying that Palestinian reporters were involved in terrorist activity.\n“It doesn’t take hours or a genius in Gaza to know about Israeli army operations or Hamas operations,” he said. “You are talking about a 20-mile-long strip that is six miles wide. There are so many ways journalists could be at the scene – it doesn’t take any inside knowledge to open the window and look at the sky and see where the operation is.”\nEnd of Document\nHamas leader says militant group ‘close’ to truce agreement with Israel"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28
"Hamas leader says militant group ‘close’ to truce agreement with Israel","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 06:03:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",1091," Jason Burke in Jerusalem"," Deal could include limited ceasefire and exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisonersIsrael-Hamas war: live updates","\nIsmail Haniyeh, the most senior political leader of Hamas, has said a truce agreement with Israel may be close, raising hopes of both a pause in the Israeli offensive in Gaza and the release of at least some of the Israeli hostages the militant organisation is holding there.\n“We are close to reaching a deal on a truce,” Haniyeh said, and the group had delivered its response to Qatari mediators.\nQatar foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari was on Tuesday quoted by the Times of Israel as saying “We are at the closest point we ever had been in reaching an agreement”. The deal would involve a multi-day pause in hostilities, the release of about 50 civilian hostages by Hamas and the release of Palestinian women and children held in Israeli custody, according to a source who briefed Reuters. \nSenior US and Israeli officials, as well as the Qatari prime minister, have all suggested in recent days that an agreement is near, although observers have cautioned that public statements during such negotiations are often misleading and any potential deal could easily collapse.\nAnalysts also point out that any deal agreed by the political leadership of Hamas overseas would have to be acceptable to political and military leaders in Gaza.\nIzzat el Reshiq, another senior Hamas political leader, told Al Jazeera that continuing talks were for a truce that would last “a number of days” and include arrangements for the entry of aid in to Gaza, and a swap of hostages taken by Hamas for prisoners in Israeli jails. Reshiq, who like Haniyeh is based in Qatar, said the deal would include the release of Israeli women and children from Gaza in exchange for Palestinian women and children from “occupation prisons”.\nNegotiators have been working to secure a deal to allow the release of about 240 mostly Israeli hostages who were seized on 7 October when Hamas launched attacks into Israel which killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their homes or at a dance party. Qatar, where Hamas has a political office, has been mediating.\nOn Monday, the US president, Joe Biden, said he believed a deal to free the hostages was close. “I believe so,” Biden said when asked whether a hostage deal was near, and crossed his fingers.\nThe White House said the negotiations were in the “endgame” stage, but refused to give further details, saying it could jeopardise a successful outcome. \n“Sensitive negotiations like this can fall apart at the last minute,” the White House deputy national security adviser, Jon Finer, told NBC’s Meet the Press programme on Sunday. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.”\nTwo sources familiar with the latest talks told Agence France-Presse that a tentative deal included a five-day truce, comprising a ceasefire on the ground and limits to Israeli air operations over southern Gaza.\nIn return, between 50 and 100 prisoners held by Hamas and Islamic Jihad – a separate Palestinian militant group – would be released. They would include Israeli civilians and captives of other nationalities, but no military personnel.\nUnder the proposed deal, 300 Palestinians would be released from Israeli jails, among them women and children, the sources said. This would be a significant propaganda coup for Hamas, and a personal victory for Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, who spent 22 years in Israeli prisons before being released in an exchange in 2011.\nSinwar tops Israel’s hitlist and his whereabouts are unknown, but his consent is essential for any agreement to be meaningful.\nThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is under domestic pressure to free the hostages. The challenge of doing this while completing the goal of eliminating Hamas as a military force capable of striking Israel again has led to disagreements among Israeli policymakers and the security establishment as well as society more broadly.\nIn recent days, support among senior military officers for a deal appears to have grown, with a new understanding that the release of the hostages should be the main objective of the Israeli offensive. Many within the Israeli security establishment have always believed that significant concessions were inevitable.\n“We know we will have to pay a painful price,” one senior Israeli intelligence official told the Guardian last month.\nIsraeli media have reported divisions  among senior ministers, with some favouring accepting the deal reportedly tabled by Qatar before international pressure or rising military casualties weaken Israel’s bargaining position. Israel has reported the loss of 66 soldiers in the offensive so far.\nOthers argue that Israel should hold out for better terms and that to accept those on offer would set a precedent for future negotiations to obtain the freedom of any remaining hostages.\nOn Monday, relatives of the hostages clashed with far-right members  of Netanyahu’s government. So far, four of those held have been released, two have been found dead and one rescued.\nNot all of the hostages are held by Hamas, with some in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a separate extremist faction, and criminals in Gaza, Israeli and other officials say.\nSeparately, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday that its president had travelled to Qatar to meet Haniyeh “to advance humanitarian issues related to the armed conflict in Israel and Gaza”.\nAccording to the Hamas government in Gaza, the Israeli offensive has killed more than 13,300 people, thousands of them children.\nA further 17 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli bombardment of Nuseirat camp in central Gaza at midnight, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported early on Tuesday. There was no immediate comment from Israel.\nGaza’s Hamas-run health ministry also said on Monday that at least 12 Palestinians had been killed and dozens wounded after a shell struck the second floor of the Indonesian hospital  in northern Gaza, which is surrounded by Israeli tanks.\nMedics there fear the hospital, the only one which up until Monday was still able to treat patients in the north of the territory, could suffer the same fate as al-Shifa hospital, which was surrounded and raided by Israeli forces last week.\nA medical worker, Marwan Abdallah, said the tanks were clearly visible from the hospital windows about 200 metres away and that Israeli snipers could be seen on nearby rooftops. “Women and children are terrified. There are constant sounds of explosions and gunfire,” he said.\nIsrael denied it had hit the hospital, while staff deny there were any armed militants on the premises.\nEnd of Document\nUS has wrecked chances of peace in Middle East, Putin tells Brics summit"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28
"Tuesday briefing: How a deal that could mean a truce in Gaza became possible","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 06:53:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",2615," Archie Bland"," In today’s newsletter: Amid growing optimism that a deal to release the hostages is back on, a former Israeli peace negotiator talks about what each side gets out of it Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition","\nGood morning. Before Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza began three weeks ago, there was talk of a deal to secure the release of some of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas in exchange for a pause in the bombardment of the territory. But the talks failed,  and thousands of Palestinians and an unknown number of the hostages have been killed in the weeks since. Now there is growing optimism that a deal is back on. \nYesterday, Joe Biden said that an agreement was almost done; this morning, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said that officials were “close to reaching a truce agreement”. Al Jazeera quotes  another Hamas official who says details will emerge in “the coming hours”. If that happens, it would be the biggest change in the dynamic between Israel and Hamas since 7 October – and some believe that it could even be a vital first step towards a more permanent end to the violence. But the US has also cautioned that until a deal is absolutely final, there is still a chance that it will collapse.\nFor today’s newsletter, I spoke to Daniel Levy , president of the US / Middle East Project and an Israeli peace negotiator under prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak, about what it will take to get the hostages out – and why both sides are considering it when each has so much to lose. Here are the headlines.\n                   Five big stories                   \n                                            Environment | The world is on track for a “hellish” 3C of global heating , the UN has warned before the crucial Cop28 climate summit in the United Arab Emirates next week.

Sunak stressed the focus was “very much the supply side” of the economy in a signal that business tax cuts are more likely than personal ones.\n                                            OpenAI | Turmoil has engulfed the company behind ChatGPT after nearly all of OpenAI’s 700 staff threatened to quit  unless ousted chief executive Sam Altman is reinstated.

An entry from Vallance’s diary from October 2020 also claimed that Dominic Cummings said that Sunak “thinks just let people die and that’s okay”.\n                                            Nature  | Church surveillance cameras in the Netherlands have caught the first documented evidence  of any mammal mating without intromission. In plain English, they have recorded bats having sex without penetration.\n                   In depth: ‘The hope is that a pause in the fighting gathers momentum’                   \nYesterday, the families of some of the Israelis who were abducted by Hamas on 7 October met with Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet.  They had come to Jerusalem after a five-day march from Tel Aviv , accompanied by thousands of supporters, and their message was simple: “We have 240 people in Gaza,” Moran Mina, whose grandmother is one of the hostages, told Sky News.  “We need to bring them all back and this is our victory.”\nThe wishes of the families carry enormous weight in Israel – and yet there is also remarkable national unity behind the idea of neutralising the threat from Hamas. “The pressure on Netanyahu to get a deal done has been rising,” Daniel Levy said. “But there is also public support for carrying on the military assault. Getting prisoners out alive, and the life-affirming story that would tell, could be a new vector in the debate, and mobilise support for further release deals.”\nAccording to a Hamas official who spoke to Al Jazeera this morning, a deal would involve the release of Israeli women and children in exchange for Palestinian women and children held in Israel. AFP reported  that between 50 and 100 hostages – but no military personnel - would be freed in exchange for as many as 300 Palestinians, with a five day pause in fighting on the ground and limits to Israeli air operations in the south of Gaza.\nHere are some of the key factors behind such a deal, and what could come next if it is finalised.\n***\nIs Israel’s position getting weaker?\nAs the death toll in Gaza mounts, and even Israel’s allies voice concerns over the extent of the devastation for Palestinian civilians, there have been reports in the Israeli media  about divisions among senior ministers. One side believes that the longer and more intense the military campaign, the more concessions Hamas will be forced to make; the other fears that international pressure to end the war is bound to grow, and that the terms of any deal will only get worse.\n“My sense is that the Israelis are always trying to get another day, and another day, and another day of operations before agreeing to a deal,” Levy said. “Each day, they hope that they’ve won the lottery and killed [Hamas leaders] Mohammed Deif or Yahya Sinwar and that they will be able to point to a major military success.”\n***\nDoes a deal give Hamas more negotiating power?\nHamas took the hostages in part because it knows the leverage that comes with the high value that Israeli society places on the release of its citizens: the most famous example is the deal struck by Netanyahu for the release of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners  in exchange for a single Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, in 2011. (One of those prisoners was Sinwar himself.)\nBy its refusal to accept a deal before now, Israel has kept that leverage to a minimum. “But once that path is taken, Hamas can play that card much more effectively,” Levy said. “They’re not going to roll over for the release of the rest of the prisoners – they’re going to demand as much as they possibly can for each one.”\n***\nWhat does Benjamin Netanyahu get out of it?\nOne reason for Netanyahu’s resistance to a deal may be his understanding that once the war comes to an end, his own position will come under far more urgent scrutiny because of a wide consensus that the failure to protect civilians near the Gaza border was his responsibility. “He is almost certainly toast the morning after the war is over,” said Levy. “The same is probably true of the military leadership, so they have not played the moderating role that they might ordinarily be expected to.”\nThe families’ march to Jerusalem has heightened that sense of Netanyahu’s responsibility, Levy added. But it’s equally clear that any resolution that ends with the deaths of many of the hostages, or their permanent incarceration in Gaza, will also be laid at the prime minister’s door. “If this ends with none or very few getting out, Netanyahu and his government will of course say that it’s Hamas who are to blame – and it’s true that Hamas is responsible for capturing them. But the Israeli public will know that they were alive, and you chose to let them die. Under those circumstances, it’s remarkable that they’ve resisted pressure for a deal for as long as they have.”\n***\nWill Israel accept a different victory narrative?\nSince 7 October, the Israeli government has been clear that its primary goal is the elimination of Hamas – with the release of the hostages second on its list. But many expert observers view the first aim as either impossible to achieve or moot because the factors that contributed to the Hamas atrocity will simply be heightened.\nEven if it was never a realistic goal, so much emphasis has been put on that message that if it changes direction, and puts hostage release first, Israel will need to have a coherent story. “The government has been pushing the idea that it is only military pressure that put a deal on the table in the first place,” Levy said. And yesterday, senior Israeli adviser Mark Regev said that  “the reason people are a bit more upbeat about [a deal] is because Hamas needs a ceasefire. They need some time to rest and regroup.”\nThat isn’t true, Levy said. “Something very similar was available four weeks ago. But if that’s the narrative that they need to make it viable – that’s fine. They might have preferred not to do the release at all, but if they have to, this is the story that they will push.”\n***\nCould a pause lead to a more permanent end to hostilities?\nIf there is a hostage deal, the shape of Israeli public opinion is unpredictable, Levy said. “But if you get 50 or more people out, then a story that has been about death and loss and combat heroics could shift to being a story about lives being resumed, families being reunited, and a desire for more of the same.”\nThe hope in the United States and elsewhere will be that a pause in hostilities could open a path to further prisoner releases, and that the previous Israeli objectives will be forgotten because of the accompanying public relief. “I think if the Israeli public was told today that a hostage deal would mean a permanent ceasefire, it would be a hard sell,” Levy said. “So the hope is that you can get there surreptitiously, bit by bit, and that a pause in the fighting gathers a momentum of its own.”\nFor Hamas to countenance more releases, they would need “a guarantee that this wave of the military campaign is over”, Levy said. “It’s not about a commitment that Sinwar and others in the leadership will be able to live out their natural days – they know they can’t get that.” Even if more hostages are released, he added, it is hard to see how the current circumstances would lead to the freeing of every last one, since that would reduce Hamas’ leverage to nil.\n“Even if you go much further down this path, you need a credible, workable proposition for how this can be brought to an end,” he said. “Hamas is unlikely to give up whatever final group of Israelis it would be holding without guarantees that Israel would withdraw its military presence from Gaza. It is hard to envisage how one gets to that point.”\n                   What else we’ve been reading                                                               As the two-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine nears, Shaun Walker’s dispatch from Kyiv  shows that morale and optimism is waning.Nimo                                                                 Being the youngest of five, I know my fair share about sibling rivalry (illustrated above).

"National living wage to rise to £11.44 an hour from April and extended to 21-year-olds – as it happened","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 09:21:00," POLITICS; Version:18",8944," Andrew Sparrow"," Treasury confirms the national living wage will increase by over a pound an hour from April","\nblock-time published-time 5.12pm GMT \n Afternoon summary  Prof Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has brushed aside claims that he should have done more to force No 10 to take the Covid threat seriously in February 2020.  (See 3.24pm. )David Cameron, the new foreign secretary, has used his maiden speech in the Lords to defend his record as PM and to make a jibe about Boris Johnson’s “illusions”.  (See 4.18pm. )The Low Pay Commission has said that next year the “national living wage” will be worth two-thirds of the median wage, putting the UK “at the forefront of comparable economies”.  As the government announced it was accepting the LPC’s recommendations, which will see the main rate rise to £11.44 per hour (see 4.54pm), Bryan Sanderson, the LPC chair, said in a statement  :\nThe national living wage has delivered an improved standard of living to thousands of people who care for our children and elderly, work in farms and shops and at many other essential jobs. These efforts over the lifetime of the NLW mean over £9,000 PA more to a full-time worker without any increase in unemployment.\nThis hasn’t been easy for employers, with the economy facing a range of unprecedented challenges in recent years. The high degree of political and economic uncertainty has made assessing and forecasting the performance of the economy, and therefore our task, very difficult. It is a tribute to my fellow commissioners that we have continued to achieve consensus.\nOur new recommendation of a national living wage of £11.44 attempts to steer a path through this uncertainty and achieve the government target of two-thirds of the median wage, an outcome which if accepted would position the UK at the forefront of comparable economies.\nThe UK government borrowed less than expected in the first seven months of the financial year as Jeremy Hunt puts the last-minute touches to a series of potential pre-election giveaways in his autumn statement on Wednesday. The outcome of the Brexit vote and years of political uncertainty it triggered has had a chilling impact on business investment in Britain, a deputy governor of the Bank of England has said. Two protesters were “reasonable” in calling Iain Duncan Smith “Tory scum” outside the Conservative party conference, the high court has ruled, in a rejection of an attempt to overturn their acquittal.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.25pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.54pm GMT \n Hunt says 'national living wage' going up to £11.44 per hour next year  \nIn his speech to the Conservative party conference Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said the “national living wage” would be going up to at least £11 per hour.  This afternoon the Treasury has announced that, in the autumn statement tomorrow, it will rise to £11.44 per hour.  It says:\nThe chancellor will deliver a pay rise of more than £1,800 a year for a full-time worker, as he confirms that the national living wage will increase by over a pound an hour from April.\nThe almost 10% pay boost, from £10.42 to £11.44 an hour, is the biggest cash increase in the national living wage in more than a decade and fulfils the government’s manifesto pledge to end low pay for those on the national living wage.\nEligibility for the national living wage will also be extended by reducing the age threshold to 21-year-olds for the first time. A 21-year-old will get a 12.4% increase, from £10.18 this year to £11.44 next year, worth almost £2,300 a year for a full-time worker.\nNational minimum wage rates for younger workers will also increase. 18-20-year-olds will get a wage boost to £8.60 per hour – a £1.11 hourly pay bump.\nThe Department for Business and Trade estimate 2.7 million workers will directly benefit from the 2024 national living wage increase.\nThe Treasury says this means the government has now achieved its target of lifting the “national living wage” to two-thirds of median earnings by 2024.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.26pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.42pm GMT \nToday’s Covid inquiry hearing is over.

He said:\nI think that one of the things that we really did not find easy to get across – and I found this surprising given that so many people in both politics and in the official system are trained in economics – is the extraordinary power of exponential growth to get you from small numbers to large numbers very quickly.\nPeople just don’t get that … I think they got it a bit more now because of having seen it. But certainly prior to this pandemic, I think people just didn’t understand how quickly you move from ‘it’s actually very small numbers to it’s actually very large numbers and doubling every few days’.\nblock-time published-time 4.18pm GMT \n Cameron takes swipe at Boris Johnson's 'allusions' in maiden Lords speech defending his own record as PM  \n David Cameron did not have anything very new or profound to say about foreign policy, or the CPTPP bill, in his maiden speech in the House of Lords. But it was an accomplished speech full of jokes, flattery, self-deprecation, self-aggrandisment and score-settling. Here are the highlights.\nCameron suggested that he would be willing to let himself by questioned by MPs.  He said:\nI look forward to answering noble lords’ questions monthly and appear before all the relevant committees. I recognise my responsibilities to this house and I’m happy to consider other appropriate mechanisms so that parliament is able to scrutinise all the work of my department.\nThat seemed to be reference to suggestions he should take questions from MPs as foreign secretary in Westminster Hall.\nHe defended his record as prime minister. He said:\nAs prime minister, I learned that the respect we command overseas also depends on success at home. We certainly didn’t get everything right. But over six years, we did smash some of the big political orthodoxies, showing you can grow the economy and cut carbon emissions, you can cut the deficit and create jobs, you can achieve the best school results in the poorest areas.\nAnd you can start to build a society that is multi-ethnic, multiracial and proud and patriotic.\nAnd today with a British Indian prime minister at our helm, we have a good opportunity to do all of those things and ensure we stand taller in the world and stronger too.\nCameron did not mention the fact that the biggest political orthodoxy that he managed to smash when he was PM – the assumption the UK would remain in the EU – was one he wanted to keep intact. This passage was also interesting because it does not fit with the thrust of Rishi Sunak’s speech to the Conservative party conference, in which he complained of “30 years of a political system which incentivises the easy decision, not the right one” (including Cameron’s government, by implication).\nHe said he had always admired the House of Lords as a “patient, diligent and considered complement” to the Commons.  And he joked about the “ornate, carved, wooden panels” in the chamber, saying it was a significant upgrade compared with his “now infamous shepherd’s hut”.He compared himself to Margaret Thatcher, saying that in her maiden speech in the Lords she pointed out that she was responsible for giving peerages to so many of its members. He was in the same position, he said. He joked about being to blame “for putting space here at a premium”.He joked about the large number of Lib Dem peers (81), saying he always told Nick Clegg that his party “would feel the benefit of participating in the coalition for many years to come”.He claimed he first set foot in the Lords as parliamentary researcher, when he listened to Lord Macmillan making his maiden speech attacking Margaret Thatcher.  He said he would not be doing the same to his successor.He praised Rishi Sunak as a “strong and capable prime minister”. And he said that his experience as an ex-PM would help Sunak “in meeting the vital challenges that we face as a country”.He jokingly dismissed Boris Johnson’s chances of a comeback. By leading the leave campaign, Johnson did as much as anyone to end Cameron’s premiership. In a reference to his nemesis, Cameron said:\nIt was a surprise to be asked [to be foreign secretary]. I have not been sitting like some latter day de Gaulle at Colombey-les-Deux-Églises waiting to be asked to – how should I put it – to take back control. Nor am I Cincinnatus hovering over my plough. I leave all classical allusions, and indeed illusions for that matter, to another former prime minister with whom I shared a number of educational experiences.\nWhen Johnson resigned, he compared himself to Cincinnatus, a Roman leader who was called out of retirement to rule again as a dictator. \nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.33pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 3.33pm GMT \n Cameron delivers maiden speech as peer, saying he hopes to spend much longer in Lords than his 15 years in Commons  \nIn the House of Lords David Cameron is now delivering his maiden speech as a peer, opening the debate on the trade (comprehensive and progressive agreement for Trans-Pacific partnership) bill.\nHe was sitting on the frontbench for at least half an hour before he started, grinning broadly and clearly pleased as punch with his new role.\nHis speech (so far) is mostly about himself, and his comeback, but also full of flattering comments about the House of Lords. (Nothing about the CPTPP so far.) I will post a summary soon.\nHe started by saying that he was only in the Commons for 15 years, and that he looks forward to spending many more years as a member of the Lords.\n(Clearly, he is not taking Labour’s threat to abolish the Lords too seriously.)\n    David Cameron delivering his maiden speech in Lords Photograph: House of Lords    \nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.36pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 3.24pm GMT \n Whitty under pressure as asked to explain why he did not do more to warn No 10 of Covid threat in February 2020  \nBack at the Covid inquiry, Prof Sir Chris Whitty says the government could have “moved up a gear” in February 2020 when the first warnings came that a pandemic could lead to more than 100,000 or more deaths.\nHe says, if someone had warned that a terrorist attack might kill this number of people, the system would have reacted very differently.\nQ: Why did you not pick up the phone to No 10, and tell them they were not understanding the magnitude of the threat?\n Whitty says there was a debate about exactly what the reasonable worst-case scenario was [ie, whether it was 300,000 deaths or 600,000 deaths.]\nHe says the system is not designed to understand threats of this kind [ie, health ones, not security ones].\nQ: That was a systemic failure, wasn’t it?\n Whitty says it is not clear what difference it would have made if No 10 had responded with more alarm. But he goes on:\nUnder ideal circumstances there would have been a different response.\n Hugo Keith KC tries again.\nQ: Given there was a system failure, why didn’t you and others aware of the nature of the threat email No 10, or “shout out your concern”?\n Whitty says it is difficult to know where you can go, once you have talked to all the people you have talked to.\nHe says Sir Patrick Vallance says in his written statement he tried to get No 10 interested via Dominic Cummings.\nHe says he is not convinced, if he had acted differently, the outcome would have been different. But he goes on:\nNobody looking at this could say this was ideal.\nThey have stopped for a break.\n Dame Heather Hallett, the chair, tells Whitty that he will have to return tomorrow, because they won’t get through all his evidence today.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.16pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 3.04pm GMT \n Humza Yousaf tells Sunak UK should recognise state of Palestine  \nIn the Scottish parliament this afternoon MSPs are debating an SNP motion calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nAhead of the debate, Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister, released an open letter to Rishi Sunak  saying the UK should recognise the state of Palestine. He said.\nThe UK needs to work with the international community to break, once and for all, the political impasse that has condemned Israelis and the Palestinians to successive cycles of violence. This would be assisted were the UK to recognise the state of Palestine within the 1967 borders, as over 130 members of the United Nations, including nine members of the European Union, have done and as the new Spanish government has pledged.\nRecognition would offer hope to Palestinians that a just and durable political solution is possible. It would make it plain to the Israeli government that a military solution is illusory and the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza is unacceptable.\nYousaf also made the same argument in an open letter to Keir Starmer.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.32pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 2.50pm GMT \nBack at the Covid inquiry, Prof Sir Chris Whitty says, looking back at the start of the crisis, he thinks it would have been good to consider asking people returning from China in early 2020 to self-isolate, regardless of symptoms.\nBut he says he is not sure what difference this would have made, because Covid was also getting into the UK from European countries.\nblock-time published-time 2.45pm GMT \n Sunak rejects UN criticism of new law allowing severe sentences for climate activists who disrupt traffic  \nRishi Sunak has rejected a statement from a United Nations official saying lengthy sentences for climate protesters could curb freedoms in the UK, PA Media reports.\nNo 10 spoke out in response to Ian Fry, the UN’s special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change, raising concern at the sentences handed to Just Stop Oil campaigners who scaled the Dartford Crossing in October 2022.\nMorgan Trowland, 40, and Marcus Decker, 34, were jailed for three years and two years and seven months respectively after using ropes and other climbing gear to scale the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, causing gridlock across two days when police closed it to traffic.\nFry, in a letter to a UK government  representative sent in August, said the sentences were “significantly more severe than previous sentences imposed for this type of offending in the past”.\nThe special rapporteur said he was “particularly concerned” about the sentencing of the “environmental human rights defenders” in relation to their “rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly and association”.\nHe added: “I am gravely concerned about the potential flow-on effect that the severity of the sentences could have on civil society and the work of activists, expressing concerns about the triple planetary crisis and, in particular, the impacts of climate change on human rights and on future generations.”\nBut Sunak rejected Fry’s comments in a post on X.\nIn his post Sunak said:\nThose who break the law should feel the full force of it. It’s entirely right that selfish protesters intent on causing misery to the hard-working majority face tough sentences. It’s what the public expects and it’s what we’ve delivered.\nenltrThose who break the law should feel the full force of it.

PA says:\nIn July the protesters lost an appeal over what their lawyers said was the “extraordinary length” of their jail terms for the direct action on the crossing over the River Thames in south-east England.\nIn their ruling, the judges acknowledged the “long and honourable tradition of civil disobedience on conscientious grounds” and that the sentences handed to Trowland and Decker went “well beyond previous sentences imposed for this type of offending”.\nBut the lady chief justice, Lady Carr, said the jail terms were “not excessive” and reflected “parliament’s will” under new laws enacted under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act last year.\nThe legislation introduced a new “fault-based public nuisance offence for what obviously will include non-violent protest behaviour, with a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment”, the appeal judges said.\nCarr said the sentences met the “legitimate” aim of deterring others from such offending.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.59pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 2.33pm GMT \nBack at the Covid inquiry Hugo Keith KC, counsel for the inquiry, is asking Prof Sir Chris Whitty about an email he sent to No 10 on 28 January 2020 warning about the risk of a pandemic.\n    Email from Whitty to No 10. Photograph: Covid inquiry   \n Whitty says he was concerned at the time that government might opt for a “middle way” solution.\nHe says he wrote this to make the point that that would not be an option. He wanted ministers to know that, if Covid was not contained in China, there would be a pandemic.\nAnd he says he wanted them to know that, once there were in a pandemic situation, stopping the virus would not be possible.

But that does not mean a pandemic was inevitable, he says.\nQ: The trigger for government action had been met.\n Whitty says that was the trigger for government taking it seriously. He says Sage met about a week later.\nIn any week, he says he gets dozens of alerts about outbreaks. He says he has a system of triggers indicating which ones need to be taken seriously.\nQ: By 16 January you knew there was a coronavirus with a 12% hospitalisation rate, and human to human transmission. Shouldn’t you have been taking it more seriously?\n Whitty says at this point they had only known about this for two weeks.\nQ: Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, your deputy, says in his witness statement he thought at that point this would lead to a pandemic. He said he was seriously concerned. He said he went to you, and he said you argued it might escalate, but that for now you should wait and monitor the situation.\n Whitty says Van-Tam is quite “instinctive” in his decisions. He says if he had asked him what evidence he had there was going to be a pandemic, he would just have said it was instinct.\nSo Jonathan, and I think he would agree with this, is quite instinctive in some of these decisions – very often, rightly.\nHe is a very able epidemiologist and thinker in this area, but if I had said to him, ‘OK, what is the evidence on which this is going to be a pandemic …?’ he would have said ‘it just feels like that to me’.\nThat is quite a narrow basis on which to make quite big decisions.\nHe says it is not clear to him that, if he had acted differently on 16 January, there would have been a better outcome in the end.\nQ: Was Van-Tam’s instinct right, and yours wrong?\n Whitty does not accept that. He says government was already taking the issue seriously. He says he cannot see how the outcome would have been different if they had responded differently then.\nHe says, if the result of this inquiry is to set up a “hair trigger” response to threats like this, that would not be an advance.\nGovernment was already engaged, he says. He says “wait and see” does not mean it was just him and Van-Tam having a chat. Scientists were monitoring the data, he says.\nHe says he can look back on moment in the Covid crisis where, if a different decision had been taken at an inflection point, the outcome might have been different. But he says he does not see 16 January as one of these moments.\nHe says, if you go to government just on the basis of gut feeling, without data, you do not get much response.\nHe says “waiting and seeing” only meant a few days.\nHe says acting early may always seem like the right thing to do. But he says that does not take into account the cases where deciding to do nothing turns out to be right.\nThey have now paused for lunch.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.04pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 12.39pm GMT \n Whitty accepts decision-making 'chaotic' in No 10 under Johnson - but claims other countries had similar problems  \nQ: How efficient was the administrative system around the PM?\n Whitty says the civil servants did a good job in very difficult circumstances. The political system was more mixed, he says. It was “quite often chaotic”, he says. But he says he thinks it was probably chaotic in other governments.\nHe says civil servants should not say who their fantasy PM would be. They should operate with the person who is there.\nQ: There is clear evidence that the PM had difficulty taking decisions. Did you see that?\n Whitty says the way Johnson took decisions was “unique to him”.\nQ: That’s a euphemism. What do you mean?\n Whitty says he does not want to make a commentary on politicians.\nQ: It must have been apparent to you that the government had trouble taking decisions and sticking to them. This “degree of oscillation and chaos is apparent”.\nThat’s correct, says Whitty.\nBut he says “it’s a matter of record that many other nations had similar problems”.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.22pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 12.32pm GMT \nQ: Did ministers every cherrypick scientific advice?\nYes, says Whitty.

He says they knew ministers were unlikely to reject the recommendations.\nAnd he says he also offered public health advice directly to the public as CMO.\nQ: Were ministers clear that it was for them, as elected representatives, to take these decisions?\n Whitty says, in the early stages, some of them needed help to see this was their role. They saw it as a technocratic exercise. Whitty says he saw this as a political exercise.\nThere was no pushback on this, he says.\nQ: Were there ever any good or easy options?\n Whitty says all the options were bad. Some were very bad.\nAnd any option would last for a long time. This took some time for some people to internalise.\nAnd people were going to die whatever happened, he says.\nQ: So the mantra that government was following the science was a bad one?\n Whitty says at first and Vallance welcomed this claim, because it meant ministers were listening to scientists.\nBut he says they came to the view that it was a bad description of the process because it blurred the dividing line between scientific advice and political decision-making.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.41pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 12.26pm GMT \nQ: Did you hold yourself back from giving advice on what you thought government should do? Did you only give advice on public health implications?\n Whitty says he and Patrick Vallance were blunt about public health advice. But they never told the government what it had to do, because those were political decisions.\nblock-time published-time 12.23pm GMT \n Whitty says he would like to see scientists advising government offered protection from legal action  \n Keith says he does not want to cover the disgraceful abuse directed at Sage scientists. But he asks if Whitty was concerned that scientists advising goverment might be open to some legal action.\n Whitty says he is concerned about this. He says the legal position is not clear, because the advisers are not government employees. He says he would like to ensure that they get protection from legal claims. That should be “solvable”, he says.\nblock-time published-time 12.16pm GMT \nBack at the hearing Hugo Keith KC, counsel for the inquiry, is getting to the point in early/mid-March 2020 when No 10 realised a new approach was needed.\n Whitty accepts this was in response to the data changing.

The interview took place during the Tory leadership contest and the interview was about Sunak’s scepticism about lockdown measures (also opposed by the Spectator).\nVallance, the Sage co-chair at the time, says the Treasury official attended Sage meetings because he actively encouraged it.\nenltrPatrick Vallance suggestions Rishi Sunak was misleading in his Tory leadership claims about SAGE pic.twitter.com/8rWc5iX0RJ\n — Chris Smyth (@Smyth_Chris) November 21, 2023\nIn his evidence yesterday Vallance also cast doubt  on Sunak’s claim not to be aware of scientists’ concerns about his “eat out to help out” scheme.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.33pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 12.01pm GMT \n Keith asks if it was realistic to expect Whitty and Patrick Vallance to relay to ministers the full extent of what experts were saying in Sage meetings.\n Whitty says writing up the whole meeting would have taken too long.\nBut he says, because he and Vallance were both summarising what was said, that provided “some degree of error prevention” because, if one of them missed something out, the other could correct.\nblock-time published-time 11.56am GMT \nThe hearing has resumed.\n Whitty said that when Dominic Cummings was allowed to listen to Sage meetings, that caused a row. But Whitty said he personally thought this was a sensible arrangement.\nUPDATE: Whitty said:\nI thought it was perfectly sensible that if one of the most senior advisers to the prime minister, if she or he wished to, could listen in on Sage, struck me as a sensible thing to do … they could ask questions potentially, but try to bias the answer that was given and that would be extremely unacceptable, but that wasn’t the situation, in my view, that happened.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.24pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 11.51am GMT \n Whitty says Sage could have considered lockdown earlier - but also suggests proposing such radical policy job for ministers  \nThe key charge against Prof Sir Chris Whitty, and Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies – the expert body he co-chaired) is that they should have considered the case for a lockdown much earlier than they did, and put that proposal to government. Hugo Keith KC put this argument to Whitty in the final minutes before the break. Whitty’s response was nuanced.\nWhitty said it was “reasonable” to argue that Sage should have considered the case for a full lockdown earlier.  When Keith first put his question, Whitty said that although restrictions had been imposed in the past in previous pandemics, full lockdowns had not been used. He went on:\nThe idea of essentially, by law, locking down all society is not something which had previously been used. You could argue, and I think it is reasonable to argue, that that is something we should have cottoned on to an earlier stage.\nIn reality, my view is that the band of situations where that would be relevant is in fact relatively narrow.\nBut Whitty also suggested that it was for government, not scientists, to propose such a radical intervention.  He accepted that Sage had not considered the case for a lockdown in early and mid-February.\nDid Sage look in detail at a mandatory lockdown … in early and mid-February? I think the short answer is no. That’s pretty clear from the minutes. We did, on the other hand, look at ways of keeping households separated.\nWhitty said China had provided an example of a full lockdown approach. He went on:\nYou can argue that we should have gone for a maximalist model. I don’t want to put anyone into a difficult position, but were we to have been instructed by ministers, ‘what would happen if we did a Chinese approach?’, that would be something that Sage would undoubtedly have looked at.\nThe question actually, I think, is would it have been appropriate for a group of scientists to come up with what I consider is quite a radical proposition to put to government? I think that’s a debatable question.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.44pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 11.28am GMT \nQ: In your witness statement you talk about Sage having a “failure of imagination” at the very start. What did you mean by that?\n Whitty says he wanted Sage to consider the experience of other pandemics. He was aware of the danger of a second wave in winter. That is what happened in previous flu pandemics in the 20th century. That is something that was not in the modelling, but had happened in the past.\nAnd he says, in the past, a lot of other NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) had been used, such as self-isolation, quarantine and closing schools.\nBut full lockdowns had not been used, he says.\nHe says it is reasonable to argue that Sage should have considered them.\nQ: So if there was a failure to think about the prospect of a “mandatory stay-at-home order” being an option, if Sage had thought it was an option, would the government have considered it?\n Whitty says, by the middle of March, Sage was saying the government would have to significantly reduce interactions by households. Whether or not to do that by law was a political decision.\nHe says this approach had been used in China.\nQ: Should Sage have proposed a lockdown as an option?\n Whitty says China “had thrown the kitchen sink at this”. He says his view was that the UK needed to find a way of cutting interactions.\nHe says you could argue that Sage should have gone for a “maximalist model”. He says if ministers had proposed that, they would have had a look at it.\nBut he says it is “debatable” whether Sage should have taken the initiative, he says.\nAnd they are now stopping for a break.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.44pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 11.19am GMT \n Whitty says Sage was not the only route by which scientific advice was provided to government. It is important to stress that, he says. He says the government had many other sources of advice.\nblock-time published-time 11.08am GMT \nQ: In your witness statement, you says as co-chair of Sage you are likely to be biased in its favour. Were you aware of how other countries get scientific advice?\n Whitty says he was well aware of how other countries do this. \nIn general, the UK system of integration of science into government is still short of where it should be, by “quite some distance”, but it is better than in some other countries, he says.\nThe Sage system “had some pluses and minuses”.\nBut he could not see another system that made him think “if only we had that, we would be in a much better shape”.\nQ: There is a tension between having a body small enough to take decisions, but large enough to represent a wide range of views.\n Whitty says, at first, it was too Sage. Patrick Vallance recognised that and responded. Arguable it later got too large, Whitty says.\nHe says it is important to stress Sage is not a fixed body. People come on to it and go off it, depending on what the problem is.\nblock-time published-time 11.04am GMT \n Whitty says the countries that could scale up testing quickly, like South Korea, had invested in that capacity. He says South Korea had had a bad experience with Mers.\nFor a country like the UK, it was much harder, he says.\nQ: Were you consulted on the decision to disband Public Health England?\n Whitty says he was just told this was happening. He thought PHE had acted professionally. \nblock-time published-time 11.00am GMT \n Whitty says the CMOs for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland sometimes gave collective advice when they wanted to give a collective view on something important.\nQ: Were there any significant scientific disagreements between you?\nNot that he can recall, says Whitty.\nBut he says they sometimes had to think about things quite hard. Sometimes they were 49%/51% calls.\nThe most difficult decisions were about borders, he says.\nQ: There have been claims there was not proper collaboration between the four nations.\n Whitty says the CMOs, and the public agencies, did a lot together. And the presidents of the medical colleges worked together.\nBut, he says, that does not mean that at an operational and political level there weren’t differences.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.02pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 10.51am GMT \n Keith asks Whitty about a comment he gave in a speech on 12 February 2020.

He suggests that would be overreaction.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.00am GMT\nblock-time published-time 10.48am GMT \n Whitty says the precautionary principle is often misunderstood.\nWhere there are no downsides, the precautionary principle justifies acting; for example, telling people to wash their hands.\nBut that does not apply in cases where acting does have downsides, he says.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.01pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 10.46am GMT \n Whitty says he does not accept that he warned against over-reacting at start of Covid inquiry  \n Whitty says doctors have to give advice on both sides of equation. If a patient needs an operation, even if a doctor thinks it is worthwhile, they have to give advice about the potential downsides, he says.\nHe suggests this influenced his thinking on advice about lockdown measures.\nQ: To what extent did the need for data impact on your advice early on?\n Whitty says, by the time Sage was giving advice, he was supporting the Sage advice.\nFrom 16 March onwards, Sage was very clear about the need for action.\nBut, when you give advice, it is also important to acknowledge the downsides too, he says.\nQ: There is a difference between accepting the downsides, and saying you should not overreact. Did you warn against overreacting?\n Whitty says he was not deviating from the position of Sage.\nThe view of Sage was that, to avoid deaths, action was necessary.\nBut it was also clear that downsides would be involved.\nHe says ministers needed to know that. If they were not aware, there was a risk of them reversing course.\nHe says this approach was appropriate. Any doctor or civil servant would accept this was the correct thing to do.\nQ: Did Sage itself warn against the dangers of overreacting from early January to early March?\n Whitty says he does not think Sage would have used the phrase overreaction. It was about emphasising the downsides.\nQ: The documentary evidence seems to suggest you were prominent in warning of the risk of overreacting. Is that fair?\n Whitty says he rejects Keith’s characterisation of this as “overreaction” because that implies he thought the reaction should not happen. His concern was to make sure the downsides were understood.\nI’ve rejected and I will continue to reject your characterisation of this as ‘overreaction’, because that implies that I thought that in a sense the action should not happen.\nWhat I thought should happen is that people should be aware that without action very serious things would occur but the downsides of those actions should be made transparent.\nI don’t consider that incorrect.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.13am GMT\nblock-time published-time 10.36am GMT \n Whitty says he was wary of introducing Covid interventions too early because he knew poor people would lose out most  \nQ: Were you co-chair of Sage, or was Sir Patrick Vallance the lead chair?\n Whitty says he and Vallance agreed that it was best to have a permanent chair. So Vallance chaired the meetings when he was there. But technically they were co-chairs.\nQ: Did you try to form a common position on advice from Sage, and on technical advice to government?\nYes, says Whitty. \nHe says in one respect he was a member of Sage. He gave opinions in his own capacity.\nBut, once Sage had agreed a position, he saw it as his role to express the Sage position – not his own, personal view. Vallance also expressed the collective Sage view.\nQ: Was it hard to ensure you were always singing from the same hymnsheet?\n Whitty says the Sage process helped establish a common position. Where Sage did not consider a matter, he and Vallance tried to agree a common view before they advised the government.\nQ: Was there a tension between you and Vallance? Jeremy Farrar said this in his book.\n Whitty says Farrar, who is a colleague and a friend, had a book to sell. He says the differences between him and Vallance were small.\nQ: Farrar in his book, and Vallance in his diary, say you were more cautious, and more inclined to wait until moving to measures.\n Whitty says they should be “very careful of the narcissism of small differences”. The differences were very small.\nBut he was very clear that the impacts of measures such as cocooning (a precursor to lockdown) would be highest in areas of deprivation.\nHe says, with the benefit of hindsight, he thinks they went “a bit too late” in terms of introducing measures in the first wave.\nHe says he was probably further in the “let’s think through the disadvantages” camp as the impact of interventions was being considered.\nUPDATE: Whitty said:\nWell Sir Jeremy, who is a good friend and colleague, had a book to sell, and that made it more exciting, I’m told.\nMy own view was that actually the differences were extremely small\nAnd the main one – and Sir Patrick, I thought put it very well – was that I saw as part of my role within Sage, in my first role as an individual, to reflect some of the very significant problems for particularly areas of deprivation, I saw for many years the actions that we were taking in terms of what was going to be advised to ministers to consider for what they did next.\nAnd that I think that was an appropriate thing for me to do and Sir Patrick also thought it was appropriate.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.04am GMT\nblock-time published-time 10.26am GMT \nQ: Did the system of international collaboration work well?\n Whitty says, in the circumstances, it worked as well as could be expected.\nQ: Can you give examples?\n Whitty says, for every new wave of Covid, the first information came from the countries involved.\nAnd he says, with the original Wuhan wave, they at first relied on Chinese science.\nThere were many groups. But they all involved sharing information.\nWhen the UK had the Alpha wave (called the Kent variant at the time), it was the UK sharing its information with other countries.\nblock-time published-time 10.21am GMT \nQ: Was there no aspect on the pandemic on which you did not advise?\n Whitty says he would not put it like that. He says he felt it important to advise on issues where advice from a scientist or doctor would be useful.\nHe says there was a limit to what they could do. There were only 20 people in his office, he said.\nQ: But there were no issues on which you could not advise?\n Whitty says quite often his office said they thought it was not right for them to advise on a particular matter.\nblock-time published-time 10.18am GMT \n Whitty says, as CMO (chief medical officer) for England, he matches what the CMOs do in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But he says he also advises the government on health on UK matters, and as CMO for England he has certain international responsibilities.\nHe says, when Covid first emerged in January, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam led on the response.

The session starts at 10am, but we have already had an insight into one of the points he might make from a witness statement  from Sir Patrick Vallance published by the inquiry last night. In it, Vallance says Whitty regrets saying “fatigue” might stop people putting up with a long lockdown.\n    Extract from Patrick Vallance’s witness statement Photograph: Covid inquiry   \nThis was in one of three witness statements  from Vallance published by the inquiry last night, after the government’s former chief scientific adviser finished giving evidence in person.\nIn his evidence Vallance said Whitty had initially been more reluctant than others  to support an early lockdown at the start of the Covid crisis. This wasn’t a great secret because in those very early press conferences Whitty argued that, if the government were to introduce restrictions on what people could to too early, there was a danger that people would get tired of complying, and start reverting to normal behaviour, at a point where Covid was still a threat. This is what Vallance is referring to when he talks about Whitty introducing the concept of “behavioural fatigue”.\nThis later became highly controversial not just because it was wrong – people were willing to comply with lockdown restrictions for a long time (perhaps surprisingly) – but also because there does not seem to be much evidence to support the concept in the first place.

The territory’s ministry of health said it believed 12 people had been killed in shelling overnight to Monday and that it feared a repeat of what happened at al-Shifa. \n                   What is the Indonesian hospital?                   \nFunded by Indonesia, the $9m hospital opened in 2016 just outside the territory’s largest refugee camp in Jabalia, in the north of Gaza City, on approximately 1.4 hectares (3.5 acres) of land.\nThe 140-bed facility, staffed by about 400 Palestinians and some Indonesian volunteers, was treating 250 patients a day when it first opened, according to the Opec Fund for International Development.  That makes it significantly smaller than al-Shifa, which had about 700 beds. \nIts services included outpatient clinics, general and orthopaedic surgery, a specialised department for abdominal diseases and one of the only modern CT scanners in the region.\n                   What is happening at the hospital?                   \nAfter al-Shifa, Gaza’s largest hospital and also in Gaza City, was raided last week, the Indonesian hospital was the only facility in northern Gaza still treating patients, with dozens of those killed and wounded by Israeli attacks flowing in overnight to Monday, according to medics.\nBut since Monday the hospital has been targeted by Israeli forces.  Gaza’s health ministry spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qudra, told Agence France-Presse that Israel was “laying siege” to the hospital. “We fear the same thing will happen there as it did in al-Shifa,” he added.\nOne medical worker, Marwan Abdallah, said tanks were clearly visible from the hospital windows, about 200 metres away, and that Israeli snipers could be seen on nearby rooftops. “Women and children are terrified. There are constant sounds of explosions and gunfire,” he said.\nAbdallah and the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said a shell struck the hospital’s second floor killing 12 people on Monday. Both blamed Israel, which denied shelling the hospital, saying its troops had returned fire on militants who targeted them from inside the compound.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) cited reports  saying patients and their companions were among the dead and that tens of people were also injured, some critically. It also said there were reports that people who attempted to leave were shot at, though none were injured.\nIndonesia’s foreign ministry said it had lost contact with three Indonesian volunteers who are part of the group that set up the facility.\n                   How many people are still there?                   \nThe health ministry spokesperson told AFP about 200 patients had been evacuated and taken by bus to Nasser hospital in the southern town of Khan Younis in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\nHe said there were still about 400 patients at the hospital and that officials were working with the ICRC to evacuate them too. There were also about 2,000 Palestinians sheltering in the hospital grounds, he said.\nMany Palestinians sought refuge in hospitals after Israel launched its offensive on Gaza last month, in the belief that Israeli forces would not target them.\n                   Why are Israeli forces targeting the hospital?                   \nIn a briefing earlier this month , the Israeli military spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari, claimed the Israel Defense Forces had intelligence of a tunnel network under the hospital, as well as aerial imagery showing rocket launchers a few dozen metres from the complex.\n“Hamas systematically built the Indonesian hospital to disguise its underground terror infrastructure,” Hagari said, according to the Times of Israel.\nHe also presented recordings of calls between Hamas officials describing their use of fuel reserves that belong to the Indonesian hospital. The Guardian was not able to verify his claims.\n                   What has the international community said?                   \nIndonesia’s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, condemned what she called Israel’s “attack” on the hospital.\n“The attack is a clear violation of international humanitarian laws,” she said in a statement. “All countries, especially those that have close relations with Israel, must use all their influence and capabilities to urge Israel to stop its atrocities.” \nThe head of the WHO said he was “appalled” by the attack. “Health workers and civilians should never have to be exposed to such horror, and especially while inside a hospital,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X. \nEnd of Document\nDetained Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha released by Israeli forces"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28
"Democrats supporting Israel oppose Bernie Sanders’ plan for conditional aid","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 11:00:00," US NEWS; Version:2",1225," Lauren Gambino in Washington"," Senator’s urge for US to make Israel reconsider military strategy is met with fierce backlash, underscoring rift on left over war in Gaza","\nBernie Sanders called on Congress to require Israel to change its policies as a condition to receiving US military aid – a statement that was met with fierce opposition by vocal Democratic supporters of the Jewish state, underscoring a deepening rift on the left over the Biden administration’s response to the war.\nIn a statement on Saturday, Sanders, a leading progressive voice, proposed leveraging US security assistance as a way of forcing Israel to reconsider its military strategy amid its bombardment and blockade of Gaza that has led to spiraling death, dislocation and destruction across the territory.\n“While Israel has the right to go after Hamas, [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s rightwing extremist government does not have the right to wage almost total warfare against the Palestinian people,” Sanders said in the statement. “That is morally unacceptable and in violation of international law.”\nIsrael’s response to the murderous 7 October attack by Hamas – which left 1,200 people dead and roughly 240 taken hostage, the vast majority of whom were civilians, according to Israeli officials – has caused a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. More than 13,000 Palestinians – most of them women and children – have been killed, according to Palestinian health authorities.\nSanders issued his call as Democrats faced mounting pressure from the party’s voters to support a ceasefire in the weeks-long war. Sanders himself has faced criticism from his progressive supporters over his reluctance to endorse their push for a ceasefire.\nJoe Biden, who has emphatically backed Israel, has seen his support among Democrats drop dramatically, as majorities of Americans disapprove of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war and foreign policy more broadly.\nAn NBC News poll released  over the weekend found that a majority of Democrats – 51% – believe Israel’s military response in Gaza has gone “too far”, versus 27% who say its actions are “justified”. The discontent was especially pronounced among younger voters: nearly seven in 10 voters between the ages of 18 and 34 disapproved of the US president’s handling of the war.\nIt comes amid reports  that a number of House and Senate Democrats have engaged in discussions about how to impose conditions on future military aid. Politico reported that the conversations among progressives were “preliminary” but that the White House was aware that “administration allies could openly push for conditions in the near future”.\nSanders’ demands include a postwar commitment by Israel to pursue “broad peace talks for a two-state solution” as well as to ensure displaced Gazans are able to return to their homes and that Israel will not reoccupy or continue its blockade of the enclave.\nCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat of New York, called  Sanders’ proposal a “responsible course of action”.\n“The United States has a legal and moral responsibility to ensure that public resources do not facilitate gross violations of human rights and international law,” she wrote on Twitter/X.\nOcasio-Cortez is part of a growing number of House Democrats who have publicly called on Biden to support a ceasefire. What began as a call by 12 progressive House Democrats has now expanded to include more than three dozen members, including several Jewish Democrats.\nThe idea of conditioning aid was also raised in a New York Times op-ed by Josh Paul, who recently resigned from his position as the former director in the state department’s political-military affairs bureau to protest against the US decision to continue sending weapons into the conflict in Gaza.\n“If the United States is to continue to employ military and security assistance as a tool of its engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (and there are good arguments why it should not), it must change its approach significantly,” he wrote on Friday.  “One way to do this would be simply by applying the laws and policies that it applies to every other country in the world: There is no point in having leverage that could pressure Israel to cease actions that undermine peace if we refuse to even consider using it.”\nBut any effort from Democrats to put restrictions on Israel has been met by furious backlash.\n“Conditioning aid to Israel will only have one outcome: it would help Hamas in their goal of completely annihilating Israel and the Jewish people,” said  congressman Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat. “It would weaken America’s national security and our fight against terror.”\nCongressman Jared Moskowitz, a Florida Democrat, warned that if Sanders attached “political requirements” to aid for Israel, he would work to “remove those conditions or condition [a]id to Gaza that requires the removal of Hamas”.\n“Let’s not play this game,” Moskowitz wrote on X.  “Send the aid to both.”\nMeanwhile, several Democrats compared Sanders’ proposal to a decision by the House speaker, Mike Johnson, to tie the $14.3bn aid package to Israel to $14.3bn in spending cuts  to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n“I didn’t agree with conditioning aid to Israel when Republicans did it and I don’t agree if Democrats are trying to do it,” Congressman Jake Auchincloss, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote. \nAsked about the growing calls among progressives, Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said he would oppose applying such “criteria” on assistance to one of the US’s closest allies.\n“I don’t know how the United States Congress, which has yet to pass a budget, can impose conditions for combat on an ally that is trying to defend itself as it has a right and responsibility to do under some of the most difficult conditions of warfare in recent history,” he said in a Sunday appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press. “I would be very loth to impose conditions that would, in effect, straitjacket or handcuff the IDF in this very, very excruciatingly difficult challenge.”\nAmid international outcry over the Gazan civilian death toll under Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion, the Biden administration is increasingly raising concerns about the scale of the violence caused by Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, as well as its postwar plans for the territory. It is also frustrated by the Israeli settler violence in the occupied West Bank, which has escalated since the 7 October attack.\nIn a Washington Post op-ed , Biden wrote on Saturday that the US was prepared to impose sanctions, including visa bans, against Israeli settlers who attack Palestinian civilians in the West Bank.\n“I have been emphatic with Israel’s leaders that extremist violence against Palestinians in the West Bank must stop and that those committing the violence must be held accountable,” he wrote.\nAsked about the growing push to condition aid during an interview on Meet the Press, Jon Finer, the deputy national security adviser, said: “No assistance that the United States provides to any country is unconditional.”\nHe repeated that the US was committed to supporting Israel as it defends itself in response to the attacks of 7 October, but that Israel had an “obligation” to conduct “this conflict in a way that distinguishes civilians from noncombatants in a way that is proportional”.\nFiner declined to say whether the White House was confident that Israel was following international law after Israeli forces raided Gaza’s largest hospital last week. \nEnd of Document\nIsrael-Hamas war is deadliest conflict on record for reporters, says watchdog"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28
"First Thing: Hamas ‘close’ to truce agreement with Israel, leader says","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 11:25:00," US NEWS; Version:1",1894," Nicola Slawson"," Deal could include limited ceasefire and exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Plus, most US gun deaths are suicides. How can they be prevented?","\nGood morning.\nIsmail Haniyeh, the most senior political leader of Hamas, has said a truce agreement with Israel may be close , raising hopes of a pause in the Israeli offensive in Gaza and the release of at least some of the Israeli hostages the militant organisation is holding there.\n“We are close to reaching a deal on a truce,” Haniyeh said, adding the group had delivered its response to Qatari mediators.\nSenior US and Israeli officials, as well as the Qatari prime minister, have all suggested in recent days that an agreement is near, although observers have cautioned that public statements during such negotiations are often misleading and any potential deal could easily collapse.\nAnalysts also point out that any deal agreed by the political leadership of Hamas overseas would have to be acceptable to political and military leaders in Gaza.\n                                                                                        What could the agreement consist of? Two sources familiar with the truce talks told Agence France-Presse a tentative deal included a five-day truce , comprising a ceasefire on the ground and limits to Israeli air operations over southern Gaza. In return, between 50 and 100 prisoners held by Hamas and Islamic Jihad – a separate Palestinian militant group – would be released. They would include Israeli civilians and captives of other nationalities, but no military personnel.                                                                                          What has Israel said? Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, issued a statement this morning warning against a deal. Yesterday he was involved in angry exchanges with families  of those being held hostage by Hamas.                                                                                Court rules that only US government can sue to enforce Voting Rights Act                                      \nA federal appeals court shocked voting rights groups  yesterday with a ruling that only the US government, not outside groups or citizens, could sue to enforce the Voting Rights Act’s provisions.\nThe civil rights law, which outlaws racial discrimination as it relates to voting, has typically been enforced by lawsuits from these groups, not by the government itself. Now that the Republican-appointed eighth circuit court of appeals has made the ruling by 2-1, this “private right of action” to enforce section 2 of the law is called into question.\nThe ruling stemmed from a case brought by the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and Arkansas Public Policy Panel over new maps created during redistricting that the two groups allege diluted the voting power of Black voters in the state.\n                                                                                        How did the judges make the decision? While courts at all levels have allowed private claims seeking to enforce the voting rights law for decades, this is an “assumption that rests on flimsy footing”, according to the opinion written by Judge David Stras, who was appointed by Donald Trump. The ruling dissected the law itself, finding it did not include specific language that allows anyone aside from the attorney general to bring enforcement action.                                                                                          What happens next? It is expected there will be an appeal to the supreme court over the ruling.                                                                                OpenAI staff threaten to quit en masse unless Sam Altman is reinstated                                      \nTurmoil has engulfed the company behind ChatGPT after hundreds of OpenAI staff members threatened to quit en masse  unless the board overseeing the business reinstates its ousted chief executive, Sam Altman, and steps down.\nIn an open letter,  nearly all of OpenAI’s 700 employees demanded the resignation of the board and said they may walk out if Altman is not brought back.\nAltman was fired on Friday in a move that shocked Silicon Valley, riled the company’s employees and put rival tech companies on alert for a talent exodus, although Microsoft – a major investor in OpenAI – quickly snapped some up.\nMonday’s letter to OpenAI’s four remaining board directors said: “Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI. We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgment and care for our mission and employees.” The board’s members have yet to comment publicly.\n                                                                                        What is OpenAI? It was founded as a non-profit entity. It controls a commercial subsidiary that until Friday was run by Altman. The 38-year-old has become a globally renowned executive off the back of the success of ChatGPT, the AI text-generating system that raced to 100 million users soon after its launch in November last year.

Media Matters’ report led IBM, Comcast and several other advertisers to pull ads from the platform.

I can count on one hand those friends who have always been certain that they want children. Now, they have them. The rest seem mired in uncertainty, waiting for the opportunity to arise – or pass. Even decisions don’t seem to readily stick. All my life I’ve felt fairly sure that I don’t want children of my own. This is convenient, given that I’m 32 and single. And yet, without my bringing it up, the question seems to keep rebounding on me, like signposts along a highway warning of the last chance to turn: am I sure ?\n                                        … or this:                     the majority of US gun deaths are suicides. Here’s how to prevent them                                      \nIn 2022, the number of US gun suicides reached an all-time high: 73 people dying by gun suicide every day, or a total of nearly 27,000 deaths that year. Despite years of intense debate over gun violence in the US, this central fact still receives little attention: most of the country’s gun deaths are suicides, not homicides. Experts say stigma and misinformation are still getting in the way of preventing more of these deaths.  Paul Nestadt, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University, spoke to the Guardian about the country’s rising number of suicides, the role of guns and mental health – and what works to save lives.\n                                        Help us raise $1.5m to fund independent journalism in 2024                                      \nAs we head into 2024, the Guardian’s journalists are already hard at work preparing for one of the most consequential news cycles of our lifetimes.

The world’s richest 10% encompasses most of the middle classes in developed countries – anyone paid more than about $40,000 (£32,000) a year. The lavish lifestyles of the very rich – the 1% – attract attention. But the 10% are responsible for half of all global emissions , making them key to ending the climate crisis.\n                                        Last Thing:                     caught not quite in the act – church cameras reveal bat sex ritual                                      \nIt was the surveillance cameras trained on the dark corners of St Matthias church in the village of Castenray in the Netherlands that caught the creatures in the act.

"‘Why can’t I get them out?’: Palestinian Americans who fled Gaza devastated over leaving family behind","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 12:00:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:2",1164," Erum Salam in New York"," US officials say they have helped nearly 800 citizens leave the territory, but more than 1,200 with ties to the country remain behind","\nThe day after the border between Gaza and Egypt opened, the Abushaabans left the Khan Younis refugee camp and headed for the Rafah crossing.\nWith the crackle and thump of gunfire and airstrikes in the distance, the two women walked south, praying that their names were on a list of American nationals allowed to enter Egypt and that they would soon be able to go back to their home in Houston, Texas.\nHalf of those prayers was answered. The elder Abushaaban was on the list, but her 20-year-old daughter was not.\nThinking it was surely a clerical error, they contacted Maria Kari, one of dozens of US-based immigration lawyers who have been lobbying the state department and congressional representatives to help US families trapped in Gaza return home.\nBut when the Abushaabans reached Rafah, it became clear there was no hope. The elder of the two – who have both asked not to be named – had to make a decision: enter Egypt alone and hope her daughter soon be allowed to follow or return together into the humanitarian crisis that is Gaza and wait until both of their names were on the list.\nThe younger Abushaaban, a kinesiology student at the University of Houston, speaks no Arabic and had only visited Gaza a handful of times before this trip.\n“She’s this 20-year-old girl who went with her mom to this part of the world that she cannot navigate on her own,” Kari said. “How on earth could they be separating families? This is not the Trump administration. We don’t separate families at the border.”\nDespite the pain from a foot which had swollen from the many miles she had walked, the elder Abushaaban chose to stay in Gaza with her daughter. And after another 24 hours of frantic calls between Kari, the family and the state department, both mother and daughter were permitted to cross the border the next day.\nUS officials say they have helped some 800 US citizens leave Gaza, where fighting has raged since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing at least 1,200 people and taking nearly 240 hostage, and Israel launched its campaign against Gaza in response, killing more than 12,000 people, more than 5,000 of whom are children.\nBut more than 1,200 people with ties to the US – including citizens, green card-holders and their families – remain trapped in the embattled territory.\nAnd for those without connections to the US or other countries, there is no immediate hope of escape. Joe Biden is facing growing calls to back a ceasefire, but although the US president says he is “heartbroken” by the deaths of “many thousands of civilians, including children”, he has yet to echo the calls for a halt in the violence. A ceasefire would only help Hamas, he argues.\nThe Abushaabans had left Texas for Gaza in August, excited to catch up with relatives. But what was supposed to be a joyful holiday, became a waking nightmare.\nWhen Israeli military officials issued a sweeping evacuation order for nearly half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people to move south or else risk being killed, the Abushaabans initially sought shelter at the Khan Younis refugee camp.\nBut as the siege continued, conditions became increasingly grim. Food, water and electricity became scarce and all the while Israel was still bombing Gaza from the land, sea and air.\nThe Abushaabans’ only connection to the outside world was via WhatsApp – and only when there was limited access to the internet. The communication blackouts in the territory meant they had to decide each day whether to call Kari to discuss their attempts to escape, or dial their family, knowing that any conversation might be their last.\nFrom Texas, Abushaaban’s other daughter Mai, 22, worked tirelessly, contacting the state department and immigration attorneys like Kari, to help bring her mother and sister home. Her efforts were not in vain and on 7 November, she was reunited with her mother and sister.\nWhen she finally saw them again, Mai said she couldn’t believe they were actually in front of her.\n“I just kept touching my sister, her hair, her face,” she said. “This is essentially a second chance at life.”\nBack in Texas, the two women are still wrestling with the emotional toll of their ordeal and neither felt ready to speak to a reporter about their grueling experience, said Mai. Both are showing signs of survivor’s guilt and have expressed a desire to go back for the people they had to leave behind.\nAll three women are haunted by the fate of their relatives who remain trapped in Gaza, Mai said.\n“My mom and sister are just traumatized from what they had to go through,” she said. “They feel guilty for even having that privilege to be able to leave and to know there’s other people who want to leave and they just can’t, including our loved ones.”\nMany others who escaped Gaza are wrestling with the same agony of leaving relatives behind.\nNaela Elshorafa, 66, of Camarillo, California, was visiting her ailing 85-year-old mother when the war broke out. She spent 33 traumatic days in the territory before she was finally able to reach Egypt and then travel home to California.\nIn a Zoom interview, she apologized for her raspy voice, the result of what she believes was Israel’s use of white phosphorus artillery shells.\n“Look what happened to me from the chemicals. I am very sick,” Elshorafa said. “Whenever they [were] bombing us, you hear and see the smoke. And you start to smell it. Phosphorus, they said.”\nHuman Rights Watch has confirmed  Israel deployed white phosphorus, which can cause horrific burns and respiratory damage.\nBefore she crossed the border Elshorafa was sheltering in a house with 50 others. There was only one bathroom. Back home in California, she still feels guilty for being able to brush her teeth and take a shower, she said.\nElshorafa is safe, happy to see her children and play with her baby grandson again. But she too remains overwhelmed with concern for her immediate family members still trapped in the war zone. Many of her siblings and cousins – including her sister Nadia and their 85-year-old mother – remain in Gaza.\nBecause none are US citizens, their chances to leave Gaza are slim to none.\n“I am American. I am [an] American citizen. I have the right to take my mom out,” Elshorafa said. “I try to connect with the media and the government and try to get my family out. This is what I’m looking for.

Why can’t I get my family out?”\nIn April 2022, the Biden administration announced Uniting for Ukraine , a program that allows Ukrainian nationals fleeing Russia’s war against Ukraine to come to the US temporarily, so long as they had a US national family member that could support them.\nThe Biden administration has not afforded the same option to Palestinians fleeing Israel’s war against Gaza, which greatly frustrates many Palestinian Americans like Elshorafa, especially since her mother was suffering from a lung infection when she left and her medication supply was dwindling.\n“Now what comes to my mind is [whether] I get them out or not.

"Are social media giants silencing online content?","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 12:37:00," TECHNOLOGY; Version:1",1360," Kari Paul"," As violence on the ground continues, emotions on social media are higher than ever – with critics asking if platforms need more transparency around their algorithms Don’t get TechScape delivered to your inbox? Sign up here","\nAs the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas and its devastating effects play out in real time on social media, users are continuing to criticise tech firms for what they say is unfair content censorship – pulling into sharp focus longstanding concerns about the opaque algorithms that shape our online worlds.\nFrom the early days of the conflict, social media users have expressed outrage  at allegedly uneven censorship of pro-Palestinian content on platforms like Instagram and Facebook. Meta has denied intentionally suppressing the content, saying that with more posts going up about the conflict, “content that doesn’t violate our policies may be removed in error”.\nBut a third-party investigation (commissioned by Meta last year and conducted by the independent consultancy Business for Social Responsibility) had previously determined Meta had violated Palestinian human rights by censoring content  related to Israel’s attacks on Gaza in 2021, and incidents in recent weeks have revealed further issues with Meta’s algorithmic moderation. Instagram’s automated translation feature mistakenly added  the word “terrorist” to Palestinian profiles and WhatsApp, also owned by Meta, created auto-generated illustrations of gun-wielding children  when prompted with the word “Palestine”. Meanwhile, in recent days, prominent Palestinian voices  say they are finding their content or accounts limited.\nAs the violence on the ground continues, emotions are higher than ever – intensifying frustration with these decisions and building pressure on an already volatile situation, digital rights groups and human rights advocates say.\n“When it feels like platforms are limiting certain viewpoints, it fans the flames of division and tension because people on all sides of the issue are worried their content is being targeted,” said Nora Benavidez , senior counsel at media watchdog group Free Press. “This kind of worry and paranoia played out across communities helps to create environments that are electric and combustible.”\nThe moderation disaster unfolding around the Israel-Palestine conflict is renewing calls for more transparency around algorithms, and could bolster support for related legislation. There have long been legislative efforts to address the issue, though none have been successful. The latest attempt is the Platform Accountability and Transparency Act, first announced  in 2021 and reintroduced in June 2023, which would require platforms to explain how their algorithmic recommendations work and provide statistics on content moderation actions.\nA similar bill in the US, Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act, was introduced in 2021 but was not passed. Such legislation is in keeping with recommendations from experts and advocates, like Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who in 2021 urged  senators to create a government agency that could audit the inner workings of social media firms.\nGroups including 7amleh  – the Arab Center for Advancement of Social Media and the Electronic Frontier Foundation  (EFF) have also called on platforms to stop unjustified take-downs of content and to provide more transparency around their policies.\n“Social media is a crucial means of communication in times of conflict – it’s where communities connect to share updates, find help, locate loved ones, and reach out to express grief, pain, and solidarity,” said the EFF. “Unjustified takedowns during crises like the war in Gaza deprives people of their right to freedom of expression and can exacerbate humanitarian suffering.”\n                   Twitter’s moderation problem                   \nWhile Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok have been under fire for their handling of Palestine-related content, X is facing its own issues after Elon Musk supported  an antisemitic  tweet and the platform has been criticised for anti-Islamic and antisemitic content.\nMusk came under fire for publicly agreeing with a tweet accusing Jewish people of “hatred against whites” – a move that will not only impact the company itself but also represents “major societal danger”, said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at market research firm Insider Intelligence. “Twitter’s influence has always been larger than its user base and ad revenues and, while the platform’s cultural relevance has declined, Musk and X are still very much a major part of public conversation,” she said.\nMeanwhile, a study from advocacy group Media Matters showed that  advertisements from companies including Apple and Oracle were placed on X next to antisemitic material. It also showed advertisements from NBC Universal and Amazon were placed next to white nationalist hashtags. A separate study  from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that of a sample of 200 posts on X containing hate speech towards Muslims or Jews, the company removed just four – or two per cent.\nOn Monday, X responded to Media Matters and its report with a lawsuit claiming the group had defamed the platform. As Reuters reported , X is claiming that Media Matters “manipulated” the platform by cherry-picking accounts known to follow fringe content “until it found ads next to extremist posts”. The social media platform is also in dispute with the CCDH, filing a civil complaint against the group  alleging that it scared off advertisers. Last week the CCDH filed a motion  to dismiss the claim.\nExperts say the platform’s actions surrounding the current conflict could hasten the downfall of X – as advertisers including  IBM, Apple, Disney and Lionsgate flee or pause spending. “The damage to X’s ad business will be severe,” Enberg said. “A big-name advertiser exodus will inspire other advertisers to follow suit.”\nUS ad revenue on the site has dropped more than 55% year-on-year since Musk took over, but its newish managing director, Linda Yaccarino, claimed in September that X would be profitable next year and that engagement was up “dramatically”. (Dan Milmo goes into much more detail about the company’s business issues in this piece. )\n                   The OpenAI soap opera                   \nLast week, the board of the company behind Chat GPT AI chatbot abruptly fired its star CEO, Sam Altman. Few knew why. Then Microsoft, a major investor in the company, hired Altman  and some other illustrious people to work on its surprise new advanced AI team. Oh, and OpenAI’s staff has threatened a mass walkout if he’s not brought back  to the artificial intelligence research company.\nKevin Roose and Casey Newton, the very well-informed folks behind Hard Fork, meanwhile, rushed out a now-outdated (but still fun) “ emergency pod  ” about just how little is known about the firing – followed by their interview with the tech leader recorded days before the sacking. \nCan’t keep up? Dan Milmo has a very digestible explainer on what happened and what it means , noting that the disruption may not slow down AI development: “Elon Musk’s latest venture, xAI, has shown how quickly powerful new models can be built. It unveiled Grok, a prototype AI chatbot, after what the company claimed was just four months of development. ”\nAltman, who is well liked in Silicon Valley all the way back to his Y Combinator days, is still trying to return as OpenAI’s CEO, according to the Verge. \n                   The wider TechScape                                                               The US spy tech firm Palantir has just been granted a role in handling NHS patient data.

"Rightwing personalities use X to bring antisemitic theories to light in US","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 13:00:00," TECHNOLOGY; Version:2",1260," Jason Wilson"," Experts say figures like Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson bringing ‘great replacement’ theory mainstream signals growing extremism","\nThe racist and antisemitic “great replacement” theory is encroaching out of the far right and more visibly into mainstream US politics in the wake of its platforming by major figures like Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson, in a move experts believe shows the growing extremeness of rightwing politics in the US.\nHigh-profile users of Twitter/X including rightwing personality Carlson and the platform’s proprietor Musk, are helping to mainstream extremist narratives that are increasingly prevalent on the site, experts and advocates say.\nDespite Musk’s aggressive responses to organizations that criticize X for promoting extremism, white nationalists and other extremists last week took to the platform to celebrate the role of Musk, his platform and star attractions including Carlson for “shifting the Overton Window” on antisemitism.\nThe “great replacement” is a racist conspiracy narrative that falsely asserts there is an active, ongoing and covert effort to replace white populations in current white-majority countries. In many versions – such as those rehearsed in the manifestos of mass shooters in Christchurch, New Zealand; El Paso, Texas; and Buffalo, New York – the purported replacement is being coordinated by Jewish people.\nFrom the middle of last week through the weekend, events on X followed a pattern that has become increasingly familiar since Musk assumed control of Twitter in October 2022: extremist remarks from Musk and other high-profile users received widespread criticism, more advertisers abandoned the platform, and Musk furiously portrayed his critics as unfairly picking on him.\nOn Wednesday, Musk described  another user’s claim that Jewish people had pushed “hatred against whites” and implied they were responsible for “hordes of minorities … flooding” western countries.\nThe comments drew condemnation from Jewish groups, media commentators and even the White House. \nHeidi Beirich, extremism expert and co-founder of the Global Project on Hate and Extremism (GPAHE ), pointed to Twitter’s response to a 31 October GPAHE report  showing that members of the white supremacist Generation Identity (GI) movement had returned to Twitter after widespread bans in 2020.\nFollowing the report’s publication, 31 GI accounts were suspended, but 26 were reinstated within 24 hours.\n“Somebody was trying to content moderate according to the rules and had the decision reversed,” Beirich argued.\n“I don’t know if that’s Musk or [X CEO] Linda Yaccarino or someone else, but clearly they don’t care to impose their own rules any more when it comes to this type of hate content,” she added.\nLast week, on Carlson’s self-produced show which has run on X since his acrimonious exit  from Fox News, he and guest Candace Owens discussed what they called the hypocrisy of pro-Israel donors in threatening college funding over pro-Palestinian protests after allegedly remaining silent during Black Lives Matter protests and the implementation of diversity initiatives.\nAt one point Owens – on the show to discuss her public feud with the Daily Wire founder Ben Shapiro  over Israel’s actions in Gaza – claimed that discussions of race on college campuses were designed to “breed white people out of the population”. Carlson asked donors: “Where were you the last 10 years when they were calling for white genocide?” Carlson later added: “You were paying for it, actually … You were calling my children immoral for their skin color, you paid for it.”\nJulie Millican is vice-president of media watchdog Media Matters for America (MMFA) who said that “as far as Tucker Carlson goes, he has always been a conduit for mainstreaming the great replacement theory. He used to push it on his Fox News show all the time.”\nFollowing Musk’s remarks, companies including IBM, Apple and NBC Universal paused advertising on the platform. Musk attributed this to an MMFA report  showing how ads from major advertisers being placed against extremist content including pro-Hitler material. Mush has threatened strong legal action against MMFA.\nIn conversation last week, Millican described the report as “a look at what the impact of X’s moderation decisions are, especially with an eye toward brand safety for advertisers”, explaining that MMFA was a member of the Stop Toxic Twitter  coalition “that has from the beginning advocated for advertisers to cease advertising on the site or at least pause spending until Musk would agree to rolling back moderation changes” at a site that has become a “playground for extremists”.\nMusk responded by calling MMFA an “evil organization” and promised to launch a “ thermonuclear lawsuit  ” against the non-profit, blaming them for claiming that they had misrepresented user experience on X.\nIn an emailed statement on Monday, MMFA president Angelo Carusone said: “Far from the free speech advocate he claims to be, Musk is a bully who threatens meritless lawsuits in an attempt to silence reporting that he even confirmed is accurate. Musk admitted the ads at issue ran alongside the pro-Nazi content we identified. If he does sue us, we will win.”\nDespite Musk’s pushback on claims that the site was fostering extremism, in the wake of his and Carlson’s remarks white nationalists and other far-right extremists took to X to celebrate the apparent alignment with their views.\nIn an X “space” (the platform’s name for real-time audio conversations) held last week, the Irish white nationalist Keith Woods and “America First” white nationalist influencer and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes joined other extremists to celebrate the role Musk and Carlson were playing in “shifting the Overton Window” on antisemitism.\nWoods came to prominence  in September when Musk replied to one of his posts attacking the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) by claiming that the Jewish organization’s “demands to ban social media accounts” made them “the biggest generators of anti-Semitism on this platform”.\nFuentes, who appeared in the Wednesday space under his latest X alias “Autumn Groyper”, attracted controversy  a year ago when he dined at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate while working on Kanye West’s abortive presidential campaign, which itself embraced antisemitic, pro-Nazi and conspiracy-minded themes.\nIn the space, speakers welcomed the more permissive environment Musk had instituted on X, as well as his role in directly spreading antisemitic ideas.\nIn introducing the space, Woods remarked that “in a short space of time, it’s really incredible how far the conversation can move.”\nWoods added: “Someone like Elon makes a comment like that, someone like Tucker, people that other kind of influencers look to and suddenly, you know, it’s OK to talk about this, it’s OK to question this.\n“Very rapidly, you can see the conversation change where the fear of cancellation, the fear of being labeled an antisemite that used to totally stifle conversations around this topic, the power of that is disappearing,” Woods continued.\nLater in the space, Fuentes remarked: “I think that Elon purchasing Twitter and the internet basically coming back online, that created the environment where things can happen.”\nThe Guardian emailed X’s press office for comment. In a return email, X press wrote: “Busy now, please check back later.”\nAsked about the white nationalist response to Musk’s tenure at X, Beirich, said: “Hate content is proliferating on X. It’s coming out of the mouths of prominent personalities like Tucker Carlson and Elon Musk. Neo-Nazi accounts are gaining revenue on the site.”\nBeirich added: “X is becoming one of the largest hate sites in the world.”\nEnd of Document\nMorning Mail: Labor’s secret detainee strategy, hostage release hopes in Gaza, Socceroos edge Palestine"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28

The Socceroos have played almost 600 ‘A’ internationals, but they’ve never had a game quite like this.\nThe war in Gaza puts this game in a unique context. The match was originally scheduled to be played in Ramallah in the West Bank – it would have been Palestine’s first home game since 2019 – before being moved for security reasons. Palestine’s first scheduled home game since the outbreak of war will instead be played at the Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium. \nIt’s their second World Cup qualifier, following a goalless draw with Lebanon on Thursday. The Socceroos started their campaign by beating Bangladesh 7-0 in Melbourne, with the substitute Jamie Maclaren scoring a second-half hat-trick. Palestine, the highest ranked opponent in this group, will be a tougher challenge, though it will still be a major surprise if Australia don’t win.\n“What we do have control over is our performance and playing against Palestine and going out and getting the job done for Australia,” said the Socceroos coach Graham Arnold, who described the war as “horrific” after Thursday’s game. “We’re very sympathetic for everyone with what’s going on, but again, it’s a game of football and that brings a lot of joy to everybody.”\n Kick off  5pm local time, 1am AEDT, 2pm GMT.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.16pm GMT\nEnd of Document\nNews live: Penny Wong confirms 67 Australians fled Gaza overnight; bushfire emergency warning in southern Perth"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28
"The pressure on Netanyahu is starting to tell – this truce shows something has changed","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 13:33:00," OPINION; Version:2",1145," Simon Tisdall"," A deal to pause hostilities in Gaza and free some hostages has been struck, but both sides are split on what happens next","\nA deal with Hamas to release some of the Israeli hostages  seized on 7 October in return for a pause in the fighting in Gaza reflects a change of course by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has adopted an uncompromising stance since the start of Israel’s worst security crisis in 50 years.\nIt would probably be wrong to suggest the deal represents a softening of Netanyahu’s position. He has been adamant from the beginning that Israel’s overriding aim must be to eliminate Hamas as a military and political force in Gaza. He appears wedded to that approach, on whose success his own political future hinges.\nBut Netanyahu and his war cabinet, which includes the hardline defence minister Yoav Gallant, have come under intense pressure to do more from the families of the hostages, who staged a huge, five-day march to Jerusalem last week. Some relatives accuse Netanyahu of treating their loved ones as a secondary issue.\nIsraeli commentators attribute the apparent change of heart at the top to this effective lobbying by relatives, but also to a belated realisation that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the security establishment have a duty to Israel’s citizens that goes beyond the destruction of Hamas.\nThere has been a change on the Israeli side, wrote Haaretz columnist Amos Harel.  “It seems to stem mainly from a realisation by Gallant and IDF chief of staff Herzl Halevi that it’s impossible to focus solely on the military offensive in northern Gaza.\n“The defence establishment, being responsible for the terrible failure that enabled the 7 October massacre, must start rectifying it. And the rectification doesn’t end with conquering territory and killing terrorists. First and foremost, it involves an effort to bring at least the mothers and children among the hostages back home.”\nThe war cabinet has reportedly been split  on the issue for weeks, with hardliners, including Netanyahu, convinced that relentless military pressure was the best way to weaken Hamas and convince its leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, to free the captives. Others argue Israel must get what it can now, however unsatisfactory, before international pressure to back off in Gaza becomes irresistible.\nNetanyahu’s shift may have been critically influenced by his personal encounter with hostage families , after weeks during which he refused to meet them. Netanyahu and his Likud party have lost the trust and confidence of most voters, who blame them for 7 October lapses and complacency. Polls suggest they would lose an election if one were held now. As ever, calculation is mixed with compassion.\nIf the hostage deal sticks, it will reportedly include the release of 50 women and children in return for the freeing of up to 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli detention since before the war. A total of about 240 Israelis are believed to be held hostage at present. No releases of military personnel or adult males are being considered.\nThe proposed deal also includes a four-day truce that would involve a ceasefire on the ground and limits to Israeli air operations in southern Gaza. During this time, it is assumed, unrestricted aid deliveries would resume via the Rafah crossing with Egypt. Whether other entry points into Gaza would be opened is unclear.\nWhile welcoming any sign of movement on hostages, opposition politicians in Israel may try to represent Netanyahu’s shifting stance as a further indication that his judgment is flawed and that he should be replaced as prime minister. Yair Lapid, the main opposition leader, is already demanding Netanyahu stands down.\nA deal and an accompanying ceasefire do not mean the war is over or that the hostage crisis has been resolved. It could, in theory, recommence with increased fury after both sides have had time to regroup. But it will encourage mediators, principally the Qatari government, and interested parties such as the Biden administration, to work for a more permanent halt to the fighting.\nPressure on Netanyahu and Israel’s war cabinet from the US has been growing steadily in recent weeks as President Joe Biden has faced growing disquiet among Democratic party supporters, and the US public in general, about the civilian toll in Gaza. The Hamas-run health authority says more than 13,000 Palestinians have died there since Israel’s intervention. About 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, died in the Hamas attacks on 7 October. A recent poll showed most Americans favour a ceasefire. \nA hostage deal would enable Biden to claim that his behind-the-scenes influence with Israel’s leadership , to whom he pledged unstinting support on a visit to Tel Aviv last month, is proving effective. It could defuse sharp criticism of US policy from countries of the global south and mitigate divisions with European allies such as France, which has called for a ceasefire.\nHamas has been helped by the sheer weight of international condemnation of Israel’s assault on Gaza, especially within the Arab and Muslim spheres. Russia and China are among leading countries that have refused to criticise Hamas. Last week’s compromise UN security council resolution failed to include language condemning the 7 October attacks.\nThe impact a deal would have on the stance and future conduct of the Hamas leadership is uncertain. Sinwar, who commands Hamas forces in Gaza, is a mercurial, radical figure. Some Israeli assessments suggest he is not an entirely rational actor. At one point earlier this month he suddenly broke off hostage negotiations, only to resume contacts a few days later.\nSinwar will certainly present a deal, especially if it involves a truce, as a tactical victory and as some kind of twisted justification for the horror, misery and suffering his unprecedented attack on Israel has brought down on the heads of Gaza’s people.\nHe will probably claim to a watching Arab world and his ally, Iran, that despite the enormous disparity in military forces, his defiance has forced concessions from the Israeli side. Just as importantly for him, a deal would demonstrate that Hamas has survived Israel’s initial onslaught, still has teeth, as shown by continuing missile attacks on Israeli territory, and will live to fight another day.\nBut Sinwar does not have sole, final say over what happens next. The exiled Hamas political leadership based in Qatar, directed by Ismail Haniyeh, has been negotiating the hostage deal, and their view of any agreement, and the next steps, will not necessarily coincide with that of the fighters on the ground.\nIn other words, internal splits and differences within Hamas, mirroring those within Israel, could yet torpedo hostage releases and derail future moves towards a more lasting peace.\n                                                               Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator                                                         \nEnd of Document\nTuesday briefing: How a deal that could mean a truce in Gaza became possible"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28
"Why is Qatar often a mediator and what is its role in Israel-Hamas war?","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 14:31:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:2",915," Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor"," Qatar is mediating a potential truce agreement between the two sides involving the release of hostagesIsrael-Hamas war: live updates","\n                   Why does Qatar mediate in so many conflicts?                   \nMany countries in the Middle East aspire to the role of mediators – Egypt, Oman and Kuwait among them – but Qatar presents itself as the region’s primary problem solver and advocate of dialogue. It has been active in Ukraine, Lebanon, Sudan, Iran, Afghanistan and Gaza, in the process hosting the leadership of the Taliban and the political wing of Hamas among others. \nObservers say Qatar takes on this role since as a small but fabulously wealthy country built on vast supplies of liquid gas, it needs to make itself indispensable to the international community and protected from unwelcome interventions by its larger neighbours, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The 2017-2021 boycott of Qatar led by Saudi Arabia showed it has good reasons to be fearful.\n                   Is there opposition to its role in the Israel-Hamas conflict?                   \nYes, on the American right and in parts of Israel. The North Carolina Republican senator Ted Budd said on X this week: “For weeks, Qatar’s foreign ministry has claimed to ‘be close’ to negotiating a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas – including American hostages. How long will Qatar continue to host terrorists with American blood on their hands?”\nGershon Baskin, an Israeli hostage negotiator who has dealt directly with Hamas, challenged Qatar at a recent Middle East Institute seminar. “In my mind, Qatar is a state that supports terrorism and they need to be called to order,” he said. Noting that the largest US military base in the region was in Qatar, he said: “The Americans need to tell Qatar if you don’t force Hamas to release hostages, you are going to exile them from Qatar.”\nBaskin is one of those who think Egyptian intelligence has better lines into Hamas than Qatar, and Qatar does not have the same lines into Israeli intelligence. Such criticism puts a lot of pressure on Qatar to deliver, both to show its independence from Hamas and its effectiveness. Indeed, the surprise statement on Sunday  by the Qatari prime minister that Qatar was close to a deal may have reflected a need to challenge the gathering scepticism of Qatar in the US Congress.\nQatar argues that some its critics misunderstand why it hosts Hamas’s political leaders – which is not so much out of ideological sympathy but because the US has asked it to.\nIt is argued that its role is distinct from the technical role that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) can undertake and the message-carrying role that Switzerland undertakes for the US in Tehran. It requires a degree of political trust, knowledge and political sensitivity. Just as the US does not mount much public criticism of Israel, neither does Qatar of Hamas. The precondition of influence sometimes is discretion.\n                   Where does Qatar stand on the conflict?                   \nQatar does not endorse the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October but says the responsibility lies with Israel due to the occupation. At a recent Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit, it was arguing for tougher messages than condemnation of Israel, and since then it has accused Israel of genocide, breaches of the Geneva conventions and massacres. It has also laid into what it sees as double standards on the part of some in the international community.\nQatar has tried to influence Iran not to escalate the conflict. If there has been a common denominator in Qatar’s stance, it has been one of de-escalation.\n                   Why are hostage talks proving so difficult?                   \nAt one level this is a technical exchange of political prisoners and as such a routine confidence-building measure in a conflict. The identity of those being swapped, the criteria, location and method of transfer have to be agreed. In this instance, it has been agreed for more than two weeks that women and children will be the first released on both sides. The lists are compiled by the ICRC.\nBut this is more complex because it is linked to a humanitarian pause that requires discussion about the number of border crossings opened, the aid that will be permitted to enter, the conduct of Israeli checkpoints, coordination of aid and the level of military deconfliction. As Baskin points out, for Israel this is an unusual kind of negotiation since it is negotiating indirectly with the people it has said it intends to continue fighting. Since the outcome of this conflict could determine the future of the Middle East for generations to come, no one wants to give premature ground.\n                   What about the other hostages?                   \nEven if the deal happens, Hamas will retain as many as 150 hostages and it will want another pool of its prisoners held in Israeli jails released. About 7,000 Palestinians are imprisoned, 559 of these serving life sentences for murdering Israelis. In addition there are roughly 130 of the terrorists who were caught inside Israel on 7 October. A third of the prisoners are members of Hamas, and only about 400 of the 7,000 come from Gaza, with the vast majority coming from the West Bank. The majority are serving sentences for things like belonging to a terrorist organisation or throwing stones or molotov cocktails. Or they are administrative detainees – in other words, they were arrested by Israel without charge and imprisoned without trial.\nSecuring their release, and the release of the remaining Israels, will be much harder.\nEnd of Document\nNetanyahu meeting with ministers amid signs hostage deal to be approved"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28
"Canadian writers ask Giller prize to drop charges against pro-Palestinian protesters","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 15:40:00," BOOKS; Version:1",486," Ella Creamer"," More than 1,800 writers and publishers have signed an open letter in support of the pro-Palestinian protest at the prestigious literary award last week","\nMore than 1,800 writers and publishers have signed an open letter  in support of the pro-Palestine protesters who disrupted the ceremony of a prestigious Canadian literary award last week.\nAmong the signatories is Canadian author Sarah Bernstein, the winner of the C$100,000 (£58,000) Scotiabank Giller prize.\nThe Giller prize event was first interrupted when protesters jumped onstage with signs that read “Scotiabank funds genocide”, while another protester shouted that Scotiabank “currently has a $500m [£398.7m] stake in Elbit Systems” and that “Elbit Systems is supplying the Israeli military’s genocide against the Palestinian people”.\nThe event was interrupted a second time when the winner’s announcement was being made. As Bernstein’s name was called, a protester posing as a photographer began shouting, so the organisers repeated the announcement.\nThe letter states that protesters were booed by the audience, forcibly removed, detained by police for three hours after the event ended and are now facing charges, which it says should be dropped.\nBernstein said she “was only made aware what had happened at the Giller ceremony after the event”, which she attended via a one-way video link. “I support the right to protest, and I hope the charges against the protesters will be dropped,” she added. “I’m proud to join fellow Canadian writers in also calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.” She won the prize for her novel Study for Obedience , which is also shortlisted for this year’s Booker prize , announced on Sunday.\n“We ask all of our literary institutions to be loud where our governments and news outlets have been silent,” reads the letter. “To call for a ceasefire; to express condemnation for the collective punishment of Palestinians and the war crimes being enacted by the Israeli government; to exert pressure on the Canadian government to stop its military funding to, and diplomatic support for, the Israeli government; to call for a release of all hostages: Israeli hostages and the 5,000 Palestinian civilians (including 170 children) who are illegally incarcerated in Israeli prisons  ; and to urge Israel to end the 75-year occupation of Palestine.”\nAlong with Bernstein, other signatories include Noor Naga, co-winner of this year’s Arab American book award for her novel If an Egyptian Cannot Speak English. “Activists do not disrupt peace; they disrupt the silence of complicity,” Naga wrote in a post on X.  “They do not disrupt order; they identify the disorder. We owe these activists our awareness, our aliveness. They did what we celebrate literature for doing: wake us up”.\nElbit Systems is an Israel-based arms manufacturer that has long been criticised by activists  for supplying the Israeli military. In April, American investigative news outlet the Intercept reported  that Scotiabank’s stake in the company was estimated to be $500m, making it the largest foreign shareholder.\nEnd of Document\nThe Netanyahu doctrine: how Israel’s longest-serving leader reshaped the country in his image"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28
"Harry Souttar heads home to give Australia narrow win over Palestine","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 17:05:00," FOOTBALL; Version:2",624," Joey Lynch"," Leicester City defender strikes again from set piecePalestine make Socceroos work hard but lack cutting edge","\nAustralia travelled to face Palestine insisting that their focus would be on football , on securing two wins from two at the start of their long journey through World Cup qualifying ahead of a shift in focus to next January’s Asian Cup. And thanks to Harry Souttar’s first-half header in Kuwait, the lone goal in a 1-0 win, they delivered on that intention, even if their performance beyond the head of their defensive behemoth left something to be desired.\nParticularly in an attacking sense, this was probably the least convincing performance from the Socceroos since their 4-1 defeat against France in the opening game of last year’s World Cup; one doubtful to have met the increased standards that coach Graham Arnold has said the players have imposed upon themselves following the elevation of their game since.\nFar from sitting back and defending against their more-esteemed opponents, Palestine’s pressing and hustle to win the ball back for much of the 90 seemed to unsettle the Australians, who weren’t clean in possession and largely struggled to fashion openings.\nBut in Asian qualifying, especially on these long trips to the Middle East, which was difficult enough even without the disrupted build-up of Tuesday’s game, the refrain is that points can never be taken for granted. Palestine were always going to present a stiffer test than the Bangladesh side Australia dispatched 7-0 last week  – something made apparent when the Socceroos were forced to spend more time defending across the opening five minutes than they were across the entirety of that clash in Melbourne.\nTamer Seyam looked to catch Mat Ryan napping in the fifth minute of play when he tried to curl a free-kick inside the near post, and Mahmoud Abu Warda’s subsequent attempt to lob in from long-range went just over the bar.\nBut in fielding a player the size and quality of Souttar – who clarified to journalists last week that, yes, he is over 200cm tall, no matter what Google says – Australia have an asset that is a constant danger. When Craig Goodwin swung in a corner in the 18th minute, Mohammed Saleh didn’t do that bad a job of trying to defend Souttar, but the Leicester City defender was just too big and strong.\nIt took a legitimately top-draw save from Ryan in first-half stoppage time to maintain the advantage, denying Seyam from almost directly in front after a ball was swung in from the right was cushioned into his path by Ataa Jaber.\nForced to stage this nominal home game in Kuwait rather than the initially planned West Bank due to the Israel-Hamas war, it was an emotional performance from the Palestinians, especially the energetic start. Reminders of the broader context were obvious, with a crowd of expats in the stands, players wearing keffiyeh around their necks during the anthem and both teams lining up for a minute’s silence before the game as screens around the Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium bore the message “in solidarity with Palestine”.\nAgainst this backdrop, it would take until the 64th minute for the Socceroos to fashion something one would regard as a quality chance from open play. Brandon Borrello, brought on as a substitute just two minutes prior, combined with Mitch Duke before sending in a shot that forced Rami Hamadeh into a scrambling save. From the resulting corner, Jordy Bos, also introduced moments prior, smashed a header off the crossbar.\nWhile their backline was stout and they probably deserved the win in the end, the Australians could also count themselves somewhat fortunate that for all the endeavour of Palestine, they are a side that has consistently struggled to put the ball in the back of the net: now up to three games without a goal and with just one scored across six fixtures since June.\nEnd of Document\nPalestine 0-1 Australia: 2026 World Cup qualifier – as it happened"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28

One of his children was born in the US and is an American citizen.\nAbu Toha had been writing in the New Yorker magazine about his experiences under bombardment in Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. A collection of his poetry published in English in the US was a finalist in the National Book Critics Circle award and won an American Book award this year.\n“He’s one of our most prolific writers,” Buttu said. “To be so widely published at such a young age and to have got all these awards and acclaim for his writing, it shows you just how powerful a writer he is.”\n“He’s an incredible poet,” Laura Albast, a Palestinian journalist, editor and friend of Abu Toha, said. “The poetry he writes is very accessible, but it’s also a representation of what happens to us, describing how he rode his bike to try to reach home while the bombs were falling.”\nAbu Toha and his family had taken refuge in Jabalia, where they heard their home in Beit Lahia had been bombed. In a New Yorker article published on 6 November, he described cycling to the house to try to salvage something from his small book collection.\n“I hope to at least find a copy of my own poetry book, maybe near my neighbor’s olive tree, but there is nothing but debris. Nothing but the smell of explosions,” he wrote.\n“Now I sit in my temporary house in the Jabalia camp, waiting for a ceasefire. I feel like I am in a cage. I’m being killed every day with my people. The only two things I can do are panic and breathe. There is no hope here.”\nEnd of Document\nThe pressure on Netanyahu is starting to tell – this truce shows something has changed"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28
"Scottish Labour backs calls for full ceasefire in Israel-Hamas war","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 17:43:00," POLITICS; Version:2",678," Severin Carrell Scotland editor"," MSPs support motion by first minister, Humza Yousaf, calling for immediate truce in the conflict","\nScottish Labour has formally backed demands for a full ceasefire in Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, widening the party’s divisions  on the conflict.\nAnas Sarwar supported a motion tabled by Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, in Holyrood on Tuesday calling for an immediate truce, in defiance of Keir Starmer’s instruction that Labour should only support “pauses” to allow evacuations and aid to arrive.\nSarwar then directly criticised Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to consider the full cessation of military action in Gaza. Sarwar told MSPs he believed the Israeli prime minister “has no interest in peace”, implying he needed to be removed from power for lasting peace to be achieved. A total of 21 Labour MSPs backed the SNP motion, which was carried by 90 votes to 28.\nThe coalition between Labour and the Scottish National party at Holyrood echoed last week’s revolt in the Commons when 56 Labour MPs, including eight frontbenchers, broke the party whip  to support an SNP motion at Westminster calling for a ceasefire.\nSarwar has repeatedly urged Starmer to take a far tougher line on Israel’s retaliation after Hamas’s atrocities on 7 October, openly distancing himself from Starmer’s refusal to support UN calls for a full ceasefire. \nOn Tuesday Scottish Labour MSPs supported Yousaf’s motion endorsing demands by António Guterres, the UN’s secretary general, for an immediate cessation of violence to allow civilians to escape the war zone and for humanitarian aid to be delivered.\n Tomorrow @ScottishLabour  will vote for an immediate ceasefire. Here I explain why and what I believe needs to happen to make it a reality. pic.twitter.com/cgiuWy6ljf  — Anas Sarwar (@AnasSarwar) November 20, 2023\nSarwar’s amendment went further by regretting that Netanyahu had said “he will not even consider a ceasefire”. It used stronger language than Starmer’s motion last week by urging the international criminal court to investigate the conduct of both Hamas and Israel.\nHowever, the Labour amendment included the qualification that “in order for any ceasefire to work, it requires all sides to comply”, noting that Hamas had stated it would repeat its attacks on Israeli civilians and would continue its rocket fire, if it could.\nThe debate at Holyrood opened with Yousaf, whose mother-in-law and father-in-law were trapped in Gaza before escaping on 3 November, urging Starmer and Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, to officially recognise Palestine as an independent state.\nIn a bid to maintain a consensus with rival parties, Yousaf did not name Starmer directly but implicitly criticised the Labour leader when he said a humanitarian pause would be “simply a pause in the killing of innocent men, women, and children, only to resume hours later. Surely, we can and must strive for better than that”.\nSarwar said he was clear that both sides in the conflict had breached international law. “We must stay true to an international rules-based system and everyone’s actions must be judged to make sure that they’re in proper accordance with that international humanitarian law,” he said.\nA leaked recording revealed Sarwar told Muslim activists in the party last month he was dismayed when Starmer appeared to give Israel carte blanche to attack fuel, food and water supplies in Gaza during a radio interview in mid-October – a position Starmer then clarified.\nStarmer and Sarwar are generally very close allies but Sarwar, one of the party’s most prominent Muslims, believes Starmer is wrong on principle and is worried about the impact his stance on Gaza will have on Muslim support  for the party at the next election.\nIn an interview with Sky News , Elizabeth El-Nakla, Yousaf’s mother-in-law, said she and her husband, Maged, who is Palestinian, believed they could die each night as Israeli shells and bombs devastated their neighbourhood. The house next door was hit in one attack.\n“On many nights I would sit on the edge of my bed and I would self-soothe myself and rock for six/seven hours,” El-Nakla said. “And when that sun rose in the morning, you were so glad to be alive.”\nEnd of Document\nSusan Sarandon dropped by talent agency after remarks at pro-Palestine rally"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28
"Netanyahu meeting with ministers amid signs hostage deal to be approved","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 17:45:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:2",725," Jason Burke in Jerusalem"," ‘I hope there will be good news soon’, says Israeli PM of potential deal for release of some of those held by HamasIsrael-Hamas war – live updates","\nBenjamin Netanyahu was meeting his most senior ministers on Tuesday evening amid strong indications his government was due to approve a deal for the release of some of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.\n“We are making progress. I don’t think it’s worth saying too much, not at even this moment, but I hope there will be good news soon,” the Israeli prime minister, told reservists during a visit to an army base on Tuesday afternoon, but did not provide further details.\nNetanyahu’s office said that “in light of developments in the matter of the release of our hostages” Israel’s war cabinet would be convened followed by meetings of his wider security cabinet and the full cabinet.\nIsraeli media reported that the deal would result in 50 hostages, all women or children, being freed in return for the return of 150 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, also all women or children. The deal would also result in a pause in hostilities for at least five days, restrictions on Israeli surveillance of Gaza and additional aid sent into the territory, the newspaper Haaretz said. \nThere was no confirmation of the reports but a source close to the negotiations who briefed Reuters outlined similar details. So did a senior Hamas official who spoke to Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based TV network.\nJoe Biden on Tuesday also said a deal was close. “My team is in the region shuttling between capitals. We’re now very close, very close, to bringing some of these hostages home very soon. But I don’t want to get into the details because nothing is done until it’s done,” Biden told reporters.\nEarlier in the day, Ismail Haniyeh, the most senior political leader of Hamas, said a truce agreement with Israel was near. “We are close to reaching a deal on a truce,” Haniyeh said, and the group had delivered its response to Qatari mediators.\nQatar, where Hamas has a political office, has been the main intermediary between Israel and Hamas, though Egypt and others have played a role.\nThe hostages were seized on 7 October when Hamas launched attacks into Israel that killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their homes or at a dance party.\nObservers have cautioned that public statements during such negotiations are often misleading and any potential deal could easily collapse. Analysts also point out that any deal agreed by the political leadership of Hamas overseas would have to be acceptable to political and military leaders in Gaza.\nAny deal would be a significant propaganda coup for Hamas and a personal victory for Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza , who spent 23 years in Israeli prisons before being released in an exchange in 2011. Sinwar tops Israel’s hitlist and his whereabouts is unknown, but his consent is essential for any agreement to be meaningful.\nNetanyahu is under domestic pressure to get the hostages freed but any deal risks triggering a political crisis. Several far-right parties that are part of the ruling coalition on Tuesday evening called for the proposed deal to be rejected and the Israeli offensive in Gaza to be intensified to secure better terms.\nMore than 12,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Hamas-run health authorities, since the offensive was launched days after the 7 October attacks. \nIn a sign it was expecting hostages to return soon, Netanyahu’s office said it was convening the directors general of all the relevant government ministries to prepare for treatment and aid, in light of the latest developments.\nKamelia Hoter Ishay, the grandmother of 13-year-old Gali Tarshansky, who is believed to be being held in Gaza, said she was trying not to follow all the deal reports because she was afraid of being disappointed. “The only thing I am waiting for is the phone call from my daughter, Reuma, who will say: ‘Gali is coming back.’ And then I’ll know that it’s really over and I can breathe a sigh of relief and say that’s it, it’s over.”\nGali was kidnapped from her home in Be’eri kibbutz, one of the communities attacked by Hamas.\nNot all of the hostages are being held by Hamas, with some in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a separate extremist faction, and criminals in Gaza, Israeli and other officials say.\nFour of the hostages held by Hamas were released early in the conflict, while two have been found dead and one, a soldier, has been rescued.\nEnd of Document\n‘Why can’t I get them out?’: Palestinian Americans who fled Gaza devastated over leaving family behind"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28
"US has wrecked chances of peace in Middle East, Putin tells Brics summit","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 18:24:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",937," Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor"," Russian president blames US for Gaza conflict as he attempts to woo global south Israel-Hamas war – live updates","\nUS unilateralism has wrecked the chances of peace in the Middle East, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, told a crisis Brics meeting on Gaza as he attempted to woo leaders of the global south.\nThe virtual meeting of 11 nations, convened by South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, came as Arab foreign ministers toured capitals to drum up support for a fresh UN security council resolution mandating Israel to introduce a full ceasefire and end what they say are breaches of international humanitarian law.\nThe moves are the latest sign of a revolt brewing among global south nations about US double standards in refusing to do more to stop the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, which so far has claimed more than 13,000 civilian lives, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\nThe UN security council last week made a call, not amounting to an instruction, for Israel to accept humanitarian pauses, but the Arab foreign ministers want a firmer resolution and are prepared to challenge the US not to use its veto to protect Israel. It was notable that the Arab foreign ministers, including those not allied to Iran, chose to travel first to China and Moscow to enlist their support.\nPutin told the Brics meeting that the US was undermining the chances of peace by trying to monopolise diplomacy in its own self-interest. He said that “the deaths of thousands of people, the mass displacement of civilians and the humanitarian catastrophe that has unfolded are deeply disturbing.\nHe added: “Due to the sabotage of UN efforts, more than one generation of Palestinians are being brought up with a sense of unfairness to their state while the Israeli people cannot fully guarantee their own security.”\nPutin accused the US of sidelining other members of the Middle East Quartet – a group seeking to navigate the Israeli-Palestinian peace process that also includes Russia, the UN, and the EU. Washington has attempted to “monopolise the role of the mediator” while blocking the efforts of other international actors, he said. He added: “History has vividly demonstrated that attempts to single-handedly cut the Palestinian knot are not viable and counterproductive.” \nOther countries attending include Brazil, India, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, reflecting how the expanded Brics group is now a strong rival to the western G7 group of leading industrialised nations. \nThe Chinese president, Xi Jinping, added his voice to the call for a ceasefire in Gaza, telling the summit: “All parties in the conflicts should immediately cease fire and hostilities, stop all violence and attacks targeting civilians, and release civilian detainees to avoid more loss of lives and suffering,”\nXi said: “The root cause of the Palestinian-Israeli situation is the fact that the right of the Palestinian people to statehood, their right to existence, and their right of return have long been ignored.” \nHowever, the eventual joint statement was relatively mild and called only for Israel to comply with international humanitarian law and accept “full, immediate, safe, unhindered and sustained humanitarian access”. It also warned Israel not to attempt to displace Palestinans from Gaza.\nThe Biden administration has been repeatedly told, including by its own diplomats, that it risks losing the support of the global south nations. Many of them accuse the US of double standards in condemning Russian war crimes in Ukraine while remaining largely silent on Israel’s actions in Gaza.\nOpening the Brics meeting, Ramaphosa accused Israel of committing war crimes that were tantamount to genocide and collective punishment. “The collective punishment of Palestinian civilians through the unlawful use of force by Israel is a war crime,” Ramaphosa said. “The deliberate denial of medicine, fuel, food and water to the residents of Gaza is tantamount to genocide.”\nIran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi called on the security council to adopt a binding resolution in UN general assembly to stop attacks on Gaza and to label Israel as a terrorist regime and its army as a terrorist organisation. He called for US to be held to account and urged the world to recognise the right of Palestinians to self-defence, a phrase that would absolve Hamas for its October attacks on Israel.\nMohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, criticised thekilling of innocent civilians and the destruction of health facilities and places of worship.\nThe Indian prime minister, Narenda Modi, did not attend.\nThe Brics meeting comes before a virtual meeting on Wednesday of the wider G20 group of nations, convened by India, that will be attended by Putin.\nThe delegation of Arab diplomats is being led by a group appointed by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, including the foreign ministers of Jordan, Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Palestine and the secretary general of the Arab League.\nThey visited the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, in Beijing on Monday, before travelling to Moscow to meet the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.\nThe delegation is expected also to visit France and the UK this week.\nThe Egyptian foreign ministry said the diplomats had “drafted a new resolution to be submitted to the security council by the Arab and Islamic groups, to deal with existing obstacles and imbalances of humanitarian aid entry to Gaza”.\nEgypt’s foreign ministry said it remained convinced that the “continued bombing targeting displaced people in the south had a clear objective, and that was to force Gaza’s residents to leave the strip. Egypt has clearly declared its utter rejection of any attempt to enforce displacement of Palestinians”.\nEnd of Document\nIsraeli cabinet approves deal with for pause in fighting – as it happened"," November 21, 2023",2023-11-28

The use of specified additives in tobacco and vaping products, like menthols, would also be banned.\nIn September, the Senate referred the bill to the community affairs legislation committee for inquiry, with public hearings held earlier in November.\nAt those hearings, representatives from lobby groups including the Australasian Association of Convenience Stores and the Master Grocers Australia told the committee that vaping reforms would fuel the illicit tobacco and vaping markets.  The groups refused to disclose the details of funding they receive from the tobacco and vaping industries. \nIn submissions made to the inquiry, tobacco companies Philip Morris Australia and Imperial Brands Australasia also argued the bill risked accelerating the proliferation of the illicit tobacco trade.\nBut the committee’s report, published on Wednesday evening, made only one recommendation – that the bill be passed by the Senate “without delay”.\nOn illicit tobacco, the report noted comments from health experts including from the co-chief executive officer of the Australian Council of Smoking and Health, Laura Hunter, who said: “the best way to stamp out the illicit market, is to help people to quit smoking and that this ‘piece of legislation is a huge step towards that”.\nThe

Details are still emerging but if the deal holds it will see progress,” Wong said.\nThis is, of course, an important and necessary step in what we must ultimately work towards is a long-term and enduring peace and again I reiterate that a long and enduring peace requires a two state solution with Israelis and Palestinians living securely.\nWong said Australia would continue working with partners “to help protect and support civilians, to help prevent conflict from spreading and to reinforce the need for the just and enduring peace”.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.24am GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.59am GMT \n Number of threatened species in Australia’s north increases \nThe number of listed threatened species in Australia’s world heritage northern rainforests has increased by 25% since 2020, as ecologists say they are now clearly observing the long-predicted impacts of global heating.\nThe management and conservation authority for the Unesco-listed Queensland wet tropics  this week handed its latest environmental report  to the state government, containing “sombre but pragmatic” warnings about the declining health of some species, including the ringtail possum, that were believed robust when the area was given international protection in 1988.\n“The insidious and damaging threat posed by invasive species and diseases, and the impacts of climate change, present real danger to the continuing integrity of the area’s biodiversity,” the report says.\nContinue reading:\n Related:  Queensland’s wet tropics see 25% rise in threatened species in three years as climate change bites\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.04am GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.47am GMT \n Court hears of Lehrmann's isolation after The Project broadcast  \n Bruce Lehrmann was booted out of a Facebook Messenger group chat with three close friends after The Project broadcast and was “unfriended” by friends on social media, the former Liberal staffer has told the court.\n“I became severely isolated,” Lehrmann said, detailing that he was blocked, unfriended and cut off by many friends and contacts that led to him shutting down his social media accounts and being admitted to a private hospital suffering emotional distress.\n“I was booted out of that group chat in the week after The Project airing,” Lehrmann said when he took the stand on the first day of the trial.\n“I have worked out who my real friends were.”\nLehrmann was shown copies of articles which appeared on independent blogs which named him as the alleged assailant referred to by The Project.\n    Bruce Lehrmann arrives at the federal court of Australia in Sydney today.

For kids aged 7-14 years, we are seeing NDIS plans with funding as low as $3,500 per year. For context, one hour of therapy per fortnight costs more than $5,000 per year.\nAutism is an “invisible disability”, Avery said, which leads to a misperception in the community that most autistic people don’t require support, and ongoing stigma about autism more generally.\nAvery’s comments come as another disability advocate, Skye Kakoschke-Moore, chief executive of Children and Young People with Disability Australia, told us that recent reports suggesting families are pursuing autism diagnoses because they see the NDIS as a financial opportunity were “unhelpful” and “misleading”.\nAvery agreed, noting that “NDIS funding is not income”:\nParticipants and families do not benefit financially from becoming an NDIS participant. NDIS funding can only be used to pay for therapy, workers, assistive technology and home modifications - costs incurred as a direct result of the participant’s disability. For every $1.00 invested in the NDIS, $2.25 is delivered back into the Australian economy\nPeople only apply for NDIS support because they desperately need the support. The NDIS is not welfare, and unfortunately there have been politicians and some media who have misrepresented NDIS participants as receiving welfare. It would be wonderful to see the media consult the disability community more, and work with us to change these negative stereotypes.\n Related:  Disability advocate hits back at ‘misleading’ claims that NDIS funding is incentivising autism diagnoses\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 4.27am GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.18am GMT \nThe Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for parts of New South Wales.\nThe bureau warns that flash flooding may occur in the central west of the state, with Orange, Parkes, Dubbo and Coonabarabran likely to be impacted by localised heavy rainfall. \nenltr???

If you were following the blog live, she got a number of questions about gambling, and the government’s plans to restrict advertising. There wasn’t a lot of news in there, with Labor still planning next steps, but she did hint at a couple of markers on where that might go.\nIn response to Guardian Australia’s question about gambling ads that could be seen by kids on social media, Rowland did tease with the possibility of using federal regulations to require social platforms to not show such content to minors.\n“You highlight the important point that when we talk about vulnerable Australians when it comes to gambling advertising, that we also consider that children are some of those vulnerable Australians as well,” Rowland said.\n“No decisions have been made yet. But I would like to share with you that throughout this consultation process, one thing that we have been very focused on in understanding from advocacy and other experts is how harmful this is for children, where it appears and what steps can be taken in response.”\n    Michelle Rowland at the National Press Club today. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP   \nRowland went on to mention “what the platforms could be doing about minimising that access to those harms as well”, noting that social media companies “know more about their consumers than governments and regulators ever will.”\n“So we are continually looking at ways in which we can utilise the Basic Online Safety Expectations to keep vulnerable Australians safe, particularly children.”\nNow, the BOSE is interesting to mention here, because the big announcement from Rowland’s main speech was that the government would amend those expectations to ask social media companies to do better on harm reduction around AI-generated content. The fact the minister raised BOSE when asked about social media ads for gambling might hint that this could be an area the government is looking at – for instance, changing that framework to say the government expects social media companies not to show gambling ads to kids.\nThe minister’s speech also touched on changes to “recommender” functions on social media, the algorithms that serve up content to users, as well as age verification frameworks for accessing content like pornography.\nRowland said the governments wants industry to “lift its game” in that regard, and “invest more in what we know can be effective age assurance technologies”.\nSo adding up all those pieces, could hint at where things go next as the government addresses public concerns about gambling ads.

Strong fuel efficiency standards will mean less money drained by the petrol bowser and better access to cleaner, cheaper-to-run cars.\nA recent consumer benefit analysis commissioned by the Climate Council and Electric Vehicle Council found Australians could individually save $1,200 per year, and up to $10,000 over the vehicle’s lifetime, on running costs with strong fuel efficiency standards.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.16pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 10.06pm GMT \n ‘Just handle this as Aussies’, O’Neil says after Port Botany pro-Palestinian protest \nEarlier, home affairs minister Clare O’Neil was asked about last night’s pro-Palestine protest at Port Botany.\nSpeaking on the Today show, she spoke about footage of protesters’ alleged actions against police and said it was “absolutely despicable”.\nAcknowledging people’s strong feelings amid the Israel-Hamas war, O’Neil called on people to “handle this as Aussies” and “calm down a bit”.\nWe have a bunch of people in our country who are feeling incredibly deeply about what is going on in the Middle East, and I understand that.

Instead, she claims she was referring to “operational and policy conversations” that “might potentially change the outcome of the case, specifically could we remove the plaintiff from the country”.\nO’Neil “vehemently disagreed” with RN host Patricia Karvelas’ suggestion the government was “flat-footed” in its response, insisting it “absolutely contemplated and planned for that we would not win”.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.37pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 9.20pm GMT \nLast week, the government passed laws to enable it to impose curfews and ankle bracelets on people released from immigration detention.\n Related:  Ankle bracelets, curfews and criminal penalties in Labor response to release of immigration detainees\nHome affairs minister Clare O’Neil was asked on the Today show whether “ankle bracelets, curfews [and] bans on working with children” had started.

Burke said:\nIn terms of the conversations with the crossbench, I continue to reach out to the crossbench [and] there’s a series of meetings that continue to happen.\nThey’ve made a decision that they don’t want to deal with this bill until next year.

It will enable us to bounce back faster from attacks that we cannot prevent. We will put cyber criminals on notice, and we will fight back against the threat.\nThe $586.9m funding committed will be in addition to the $2.3bn to 2030 set out for the existing Cyber Security Strategy, delivered by the Australian Signals Directorate.\nThe strategy’s action plan outlines the first two years, focusing on addressing critical gaps across industry and government, while the period between 2026 and 2028 will work on scaling “cyber maturity across the whole economy”.\nFrom 2029, the action plan says, Australia will “advance the global frontier of cyber security”.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.43pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 7.31pm GMT \n Welcome  \nGood morning and welcome to the rolling news blog.

Documents published by the high court suggest home affairs minister Clare O’Neil was advised that using her powers to grant NZYQ a visa might neutralise the court challenge that last week led to the release of 92 others. And it’s a busy day for O’Neil, who is today announcing plans to make Australia a world leader in cyber security by 2030 with a $586.9 funding boost. More coming up on these stories.\nSixty legal advocacy and civil rights groups around Australia are teaming up today to call on governments to protect the right to protest in the face of recent “draconian anti-protest laws”.  The issue has risen to the top of the political agenda amid rival mass protests by supporters of Palestine and Israel in recent weeks. New South Wales police are likely to be handed  the power to lay charges for threats and incitement to violence based on race and religion in a reform introduced to state parliament.\nThe cost of living is still right at the top of that political agenda as a survey reveals today how people are having to pay $600 a week to rent in Australia’s most expensive suburbs.  All of the top 10 are in Sydney, led by Warriewood in the northern beaches, although St Kilda in Melbourne is in joint 10th. Energy costs are also a burden on household expenses and a new report today shows that electricity network providers raked in $2bn from customers in “superprofits”  in just one year.

"Susan Sarandon dropped by talent agency after remarks at pro-Palestine rally","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-21 21:40:00," FILM; Version:5",711," Adrian Horton"," UTA lets Oscar-winning actor go after she spoke at several pro-Palestine rallies","\nThe Hollywood talent agency UTA has dropped Susan Sarandon as a client after she spoke at a pro-Palestine rally over the weekend, a spokesperson for the agency confirmed to Deadline. \nThe Oscar-winning actor attended several rallies in support of Palestine and drew criticism for saying: “There are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country.”\nIn remarks captured on video , Sarandon encouraged others to keep speaking up in support of Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war. “People are questioning, people are standing up, people are educating themselves, people are stepping away from brainwashing that started when they were kids,” said Sarandon at the rally. She encouraged attendees to “be strong, be patient, be clear and stand with anybody who has the courage to speak out” and thanked “the Jewish community who’s come out to have our backs”.\nSarandon went on to repost a pro-Palestinian message from Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters on X, formerly known as Twitter. Waters has been criticized over the years for alleged antisemitic remarks, although he has always rejected those claims, previously saying: “I have spent my entire life speaking out against authoritarianism and oppression wherever I see it. When I was a child after the war, the name of Anne Frank was often spoken in our house, she became a permanent reminder of what happens when fascism is left unchecked. My parents fought the Nazis in World War II, with my father paying the ultimate price.”\nSince the Hamas attack on 7 October that killed at least 1,200 Israelis and led to hundreds being taken hostage, more than 14,000 people have been killed in the Israeli assault on Gaza, including at least 5,600 children, according to Hamas-run health authorities.\nSarandon is the latest public figure to find themselves in hot water over their stance on the war, particularly in support of Palestine.  Scream VI star Melissa Barrera, who was lined up to play the lead in the upcoming Scream VII, was fired from the film on Tuesday by the production company Spyglass; the company told Variety  they removed her from the film due to some social media posts that had been interpreted as antisemitic.\nBarrera has been posting on her Instagram about her support for Palestine and described Israel as committing “genocide”, and “brutally killing innocent Palestinians, mothers and children, under the pretence of destroying Hamas”.\n“Western media only shows the [Israeli] side. Why do they do that, I will let you deduce for yourself,” she wrote on 22 October, adding: “We don’t need more hate. No Islamophobia. No Anti-semitism [sic].”\nThe Guardian has not confirmed which posts Spyglass was referring to.  Barrera has yet to respond to requests for comment.\nLast month, Maha Dakhil, the co-head of film at Hollywood powerhouse agency CAA, faced internal backlash and resigned from the agency’s board after she reposted an image on Instagram that read, in part: “You’re currently learning who supports genocide.”\nDakhil added the caption: “That’s the line for me.” She then posted a second image that read: “What’s more heartbreaking than witnessing genocide? Witnessing the denial that genocide is happening.”\nThe posts prompted the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, one of Dakhil and CAA’s prominent clients, to publicly denounce her words and leave the agency for rival William Morris Endeavor Entertainment (WME). “Maha isn’t an antisemite, she’s just wrong. She’s a great agent and I’m very proud of the work we did together over the last six years,” Sorkin said in a statement to Variety.\nDakhil has since deleted both images and made a public apology. “I made a mistake with a repost in my Instagram story, which used hurtful language. Like so many of us, I have been reeling with heartbreak. I pride myself on being on the side of humanity and peace,” Dakhil said in a statement to Variety. \n“I’m so grateful to Jewish friends and colleagues who pointed out the implications and further educated me. I immediately took the repost down. I’m sorry for the pain I have caused,” she said.\nSarandon reportedly signed with UTA in 2014. She appeared this year in the movies Blue Beetle and Maybe I Do, and did a handful of television appearances.\nEnd of Document\nWhy is Qatar often a mediator and what is its role in Israel-Hamas war?"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28
"Jill Stein formally launches 2024 White House bid as Green party candidate","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 01:47:00," US NEWS; Version:1",800," Robert Tait"," Stein is latest in a series of mostly leftist figures to announce candidacies with the potential to erode Biden’s core support","\nA new front opened in the growing threats to Joe Biden’s presidency on Tuesday when the left-wing environmentalist Jill Stein formally launched her third presidential bid in an online conversation with two fellow progressive activists.\nStein, 73, who is bidding to become the US Green party’s nominee, is the latest in a series of mostly leftist figures to announce candidacies with the potential to erode Biden’s core support in an expected re-match against Donald Trump in next year’s poll.\nHaving previously announced her candidacy with a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, she gave added substance to her campaign in a live Zoom conversation with Chris Smalls, a US trade union organiser for Amazon workers, and Miko Peled, an Israeli-born pro-Palestinian activist.\n“This is all about our community rising up for our higher values,” Stein said. “This is a totally unprecedented political moment.”\nThe choice of protagonists appeared designed to signal key themes in Stein’s candidacy – workers’ rights, high living costs, and US support for Israel, all issues where Biden is showing vulnerability among his voter base.\n“On all these issues, we’re in the target hairs,” Stein said. “We need to start building an America that works for all of us and that includes a living working wage … a Green New Deal … an economic bill of rights. We can end endless wars which don’t solve anything.”\nStein’s entry into the race has special resonance because of her supposedly decisive role in tipping battleground states to Trump in his 2016 presidential election victory over Hillary Clinton.\nWhile winning just 1.4m votes nationwide, Stein won more votes in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan than Trump’s narrow victory margins, prompting many analysts to conclude that her presence on the ballot was decisive in drawing progressive voters away from Clinton.\nStein also stood as the Green’s candidate in the 2012 election, when she won just over 400,000 votes nationally and was not thought to have played a decisive role in President Barack Obama’s victory over the Republican, Mitt Romney.\nHer attempt to earn the Green’s nomination in 2024 follows the decision last month by the party’s original likely nominee, Cornel West, to leave the party and run as an independent.\nBoth figures join a growing field of purported third party or independent candidates amid growing signs of voter dissatisfaction at the prospect of a repeat of the 2020 presidential race between Biden and Trump.\nWith the exception of Robert F Kennedy Jr – son of the late attorney general, whose anti-vaccine stance is thought to be attractive to voters on the right – most non-mainstream candidates are thought to pose a greater threat to Biden than Trump, who is far ahead of other candidates to win the Republican nomination.\nBiden, who turned 81 this week, faces growing concerns over his age – even though he is just four years older than Trump – and rumbling economic discontent. A recent poll showed Biden trailing his predecessor in five out of six battleground states that he won in 2020.\nThe president’s path to re-election could become more complicated still if Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator for West Virginia, decides to run as an independent centrist candidate after announcing last week that he would not seek re-election to the Senate.\nManchin has fueled speculation about a presidential run after announcing plans to travel the country to explore the possibility of “creating a movement to mobilise the middle”.\nBiden also faces a primary challenge from within his own party in the shape of the Democratic congressman Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who has announced that he will run against the president.\nStein, who is Jewish, has attacked Biden’s unstinting support for Israel in its response to the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people. She has called for a ceasefire to the Israeli military offensive in Gaza, a stance that could potentially gain her support in Michigan, a battleground state containing many ethnic Arab voters who have become disenchanted with Biden’s pro-Israel posture.\nIn an interview with Newsweek, she warned that Biden’s support for Israel risked nuclear war. She also called Israel an “apartheid state” and said it was committing “genocide” in Gaza, where more than 13,000 Palestinians have been killed since the country launched its military assault in retaliation for Hamas’s attack.\nIn her campaign video, launched on 9 November, Stein, a medical doctor, called both the Democratic and Republican parties “a threat to our democracy”.\n“People are tired of being thrown under the bus by wealthy elites and their bought politicians,” she said. “The political system is broken. We need a party that serves the people. I’m running for president to offer that choice for the people.”\nEnd of Document\nFirst Thing: Israel and Hamas agree to four-day ceasefire and release of 50 hostages"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28
"Israel and Hamas agree deal for release of some hostages and four-day ceasefire","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 02:14:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:6",1318," Jason Burke in Jerusalem, Ruth Michaelson in Istanbul and Julian Borger in Washington"," Fifty Israeli hostages held in Gaza will be freed over four days in exchange for the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners and a lull in Israeli military operationsIsrael-Hamas war: latest updates","\nIsrael and Hamas have agreed a deal for the release of 50 women and children hostages held in Gaza in return for 150 Palestinian women and children to be freed from Israeli jails during a four-day ceasefire, both sides announced on Wednesday morning.\nThe deal was confirmed by a senior US official, who told reporters that the freed hostages would include three Americans, one of them a three year-old girl. The official said that the first hostage release is expected on Thursday morning, and the total number of hostages freed could rise.\nUS president Joe Biden welcomed the deal and thanked Egypt and Qatar for their “critical leadership and partnership” in reaching the deal. He added: “And I appreciate the commitment that Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu and his government have made in supporting an extended pause to ensure this deal can be fully carried out and to ensure the provision of additional humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of innocent Palestinian families in Gaza … It is important that all aspects of this deal be fully implemented.\n“Today’s deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released.”\nThe senior US official said: “The deal has ultimately been structured to incentivise releases beyond 50”, adding that the agreement “is now structured for women and children in the first phase, but with an expectation for further releases”.\nA statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office said the “lull” in Israeli military operations would be extended for an additional day for every 10 more hostages released. It did not say when the ceasefire would start, though in his address to his cabinet, Benjamin Netanyahu said the first hostages should be free within 48 hours of the agreement.\nQatar’s foreign ministry said early on Wednesday that the start time of the deal would be announced in the next 24 hours and that the ceasefire will “allow the entry of a larger number of humanitarian convoys and relief aid, including fuel designated for humanitarian needs”.\nHamas confirmed an agreement had been reached, calling it a “humanitarian truce” in which 150 Palestinian women and children would be freed from Israeli jails. The militant movement said that expanded humanitarian deliveries were also part of the agreement, as well as a halt to Israeli air sorties over southern Gaza during the four-day pause, with sorties over northern Gaza restricted to six hours a day. According to the Hamas statement, Israel agreed not to arrest anyone in Gaza for the duration of the temporary truce.\n“The Israeli government is committed to the return of all abductees home,” the government statement said.. “Tonight, the government approved the outline for the first stage of achieving this goal, according to which at least 50 abductees — women and children — will be released for four days, during which there will be a lull in the fighting. The release of every 10 additional abductees will result in an additional day of respite.”\nThe statement added: “The government of Israel, the IDF [Israel Defence Forces] and the security services will continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza.”\nThe Israeli confirmation of the agreement followed an extended meeting of the full 38-member Israeli cabinet over the terms, in the face of opposition from far right-wingers.\nThe debate ended shortly before 3am in Tel Aviv. Before the government vote, Netanyahu, assured his cabinet that the security agencies all supported the hostage deal, and that it would not mean an end to the military campaign against Hamas, which Netanyahu said would resume after the ceasefire was over.\n“We are at war, and we will continue the war,” Netanyahu said. “We will continue until we achieve all our goals.”\nIsrael has also agreed to allow more aid into Gaza, which is suffering an acute humanitarian crisis after seven weeks of relentless bombardment and blockade.\nThe deal is also thought to include visits by the Red Cross to remaining hostages and a distribution of medicine. \nThe deal, struck after weeks of talks mediated by Qatar , comes more than six weeks after the conflict began on 7 October, when Hamas launched attacks from Gaza into southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 240 people hostage.\nMore than 14,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the government media office in Gaza. Another 2,700 others are missing and believed to be buried under rubble.\nNetanyahu, who has pledged to “crush” Hamas, made the announcement after Israel’s war cabinet was convened followed by meetings of the wider security cabinet and the full government.\nOpening the final meeting, Netanyahu said the deal was a difficult decision but the right decision, claiming it had the full support of the security agencies. \n“They have made it completely clear in their professional assessment, that the security of our forces will be ensured during the pause and that the intelligence effort will be maintained in those days,” Netanyahu said. “They have made it clear that not only will the war effort not be harmed, it will enable the IDF [Israel Defence Forces] to prepare for the continuation of the fighting.”\nEven as Netanyahu’s government discussed the deal, airstrikes continued in Gaza and Hamas fired rockets into Israel.\nNetanyahu also said the intervention of US president Joe Biden had helped to improve the deal so that it included more hostages for fewer concessions.\nIf implemented, the agreement would still leave some 190 hostages in Gaza, of whom roughly half are thought to be military personnel.\nQatar, where Hamas has a political office, has been the main intermediary between Israel and the extremist Islamist organisation, though Egypt and others have played a role.\nNot all of the hostages are being held by Hamas, with some in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a separate extremist faction, and criminals in Gaza, say Israeli and other officials.\nMost hostages are Israeli, but almost half of the hostages have dual nationality , including from Argentina, Germany, America, France, Thailand, Nepal and Russia. Hospitals in Israel have been prepared to receive those released, Israeli media reported.\nThe deal is a significant propaganda coup for Hamas and a personal victory for Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza , who spent 23 years in Israeli prisons before being released in an exchange in 2011. Sinwar tops Israel’s hitlist and his whereabouts are unknown.\nEnsuring that the terms of the deal are met from their side will require Hamas to ensure that all 50 hostages reach the borders of Gaza safely, a major logistical challenge. The group previously indicated  during negotiations that they were unaware of the exact location of every hostage due to the varied groups holding them across the territory.\nNetanyahu will now be under domestic pressure to get the rest of the hostages freed but faces growing political risks. Several far-right parties that are part of the ruling coalition on Tuesday evening opposed the proposed deal and called for the Israeli offensive in Gaza to be intensified to secure better terms. Their statements prompted protests in Tel Aviv by hostages families.\nIsraeli officials have suggested that the hostages to be released in coming days will be selected from those held by Hamas, which will then try to locate others held by different groups or factions.\nThe armed wing of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad announced late on Tuesday the death of one of the Israeli hostages it has been holding.\nTwo Americans and two Israeli nationals were freed in mid-October by Hamas. The Israeli military last month rescued one of its soldiers, and last week it said it had recovered the bodies of two hostages during the offensive.\nEnd of Document\nGaza hostage deal: what do we know?"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28

Mounted police started running their horses into the crowd.”\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThomas said protesters tried to get out of the way but the exit was a narrow pathway and there was potential for a “terrifying” crowd crush.\n“It felt like police were … recklessly indifferent to it,” Thomas claimed.\n“I found what has been really shocking is that despite how much footage there is, that the premier has backed the police.”\nFreelance photographer and journalist Ran Fields witnessed and filmed the police response and said in no instance did he see any of the protesters “act first”.\n“They were not aggressive in the crowd. They were not provoking the officers in the crowds,” he said.\nFields, who showed the videos he took to Guardian Australia to corroborate his claims, said he did not think the way in which the officers were engaging with the protesters was proportionate.\n“A person was being held down but also given an order to stand up, but their legs were being contorted by another officer,” he claimed.\n“And the police officer came and smacked their phone out of their hands, grabbed them by the arm and slung … their body into the ground.”\nNSW police declined to comment further when contacted by Guardian Australia.\n                   Rights groups voice ‘deep concern’                   \nThe NSW Council for Civil Liberties, the Human Rights Law Centre and the Australian Democracy Network released a joint statement saying they were “deeply concerned” about the “police repression of a peaceful protest”.\nThey also accused police of causing a “crowd crush” and alleged that officers “physically pushed” several independent legal observers who were there.\nThe premier defended the police and said he “completely rejected” any suggestion their response was disproportionate.\nAddressing the media on Wednesday, Minns said the protesters had occupied a street without organisers lodging a form 1 declaration, which they were required to do in order for the event to be “authorised”.\n“It was only after ample time was given to the protesters to leave the roadway and allow commerce to transact in that port were arrests effected,” he said.\n“Now, I think any reasonable person would say, once you stack up that chronology, the police acted completely responsibly.”\nThe police commissioner, Karen Webb, said police were “very patient” in dealing with the protesters and only took “proportionate” action when they failed to comply with orders to move on.\nWebb claimed a “large number” of the people present were “professional protesters” who were “currently protesting about the Gaza conflict but next week they’ll probably protest about something else”.\nThe protesters who were arrested were charged with failing to comply with a move on direction and damaging or disrupting a major facility. One 29-year-old woman was also charged with assaulting a police officer without causing actual bodily harm.\nPolice said all of the people arrested were released on bail except for two, a 24-year-old man and another 29-year-old woman, who were remanded in custody to appear at the Downing Centre local court on Wednesday.\nThe NSW opposition leader, Mark Speakman, threw his support behind the police. He said it was “disturbing” that there had been a confrontation at a public place and people’s right to import goods had been disrupted.\nSpeakman called on Minns and the police minister, Yasmin Catley, to condemn the Sydney branch of the Maritime Union of Australia for their involvement in the protest.\nMinns attempted to distance his government from the union on Wednesday morning. The MUA, which is affiliated with the NSW Labor party, declined to comment.\nNSW Greens MPs Sue Higginson and Jenny Leong accused police of responding to the protesters with “unprovoked and unbridled aggression”.\n“Violence against peaceful protesters can never be justified – and must never be tolerated,” they said.\nOne of the protest’s organisers, Ahmed Abadla, condemned the police response, saying the protest was a “peaceful, nonviolent boycott”.\nEnd of Document\nMan found dead after statewide search – as it happened"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28

We had to make it clear that no release is planned before Friday, because of the uncertainty that hostages’ families are facing,” Kan quoted a source in Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office as saying.\nblock-time published-time 12.25am GMT \nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken has also been on the telephone, talking to his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud,  in which the pair reaffirmed their commitment to preventing the further spread of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the State Department said according to Reuters.\nBlinken also welcomed Saudi Arabia’s efforts to secure a durable peace agreement in Yemen, the state department said.\nThere have been fears of a regional overspill, as violence has broken out along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon  and US forces have been attacked in Iraq and Syria.

It continued:\nHe [Biden] also affirmed that under no circumstances can Gaza remain a sanctuary for Hamas where they can threaten Israel and Palestinians alike and imperil any pathway to a durable peace.\nThe President affirmed his commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state and recognized Egypt’s essential role in setting the conditions for that outcome.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.43pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 11.29pm GMT \n Ceasefire also delayed, reports say  \nMultiple news media are reporting that the ceasefire will also be delayed, as well as the hostage deal.\nAn Israeli source told Israeli newspaper Haaretz that there would be no halt to the fighting in Gaza as long as there is no finalised timeline for the agreement with Hamas.\nThe BBC also reported that an Israeli government source said there would be a delay to the ceasefire, which had been expected to begin at 10am (0800GMT) on Thursday with the release of hostages expected to begin shortly after.\nAn Israeli official meanwhile told the news agency AFP early Thursday there would be no halt in the fighting between Israel and Hamas “before Friday”.\nThe reports come shortly after Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said late Wednesday that none of the hostages seized in the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7 would be freed before Friday.\nblock-time published-time 11.12pm GMT \nUS President Joe Biden “emphasized the importance of maintaining calm along the Lebanese border as well as in the West Bank”, in a phone call with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in which he welcomed the hostage deal, the White House has said.\nIn a statement , the White House said the two leaders discussed the pause in fighting, which “will allow for surging in much needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza”.

Here’s a recap of the latest developments:\nA senior Israeli official has said that the planned exchange of some Palestinians held in Israeli prisons for Israeli hostages in Hamas has been delayed until at least Friday.  In a statement released on Wednesday night, Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said talks on the deal were continuing and that the release “will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday.”The first ceasefire in seven weeks of war in Gaza is due to come into effect  on Thursday morning, officials from both Hamas and Israel have said.  A four-day truce was announced early on Wednesday  after days of feverish speculation and intense negotiations. Under the agreement, Hamas will free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages  they took on 7 October. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials. It is not thought that the reported delay  in the release of hostages will impact the ceasefire start time. The deal, struck after lengthy and complex talks mediated by Qatar , the US and Egypt, comes more than six weeks after the conflict began on 7 October, when Hamas launched attacks from Gaza into southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 240 people hostage. The Israeli offensive has killed between 13,000 and 14,000 people, thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has warned that “the war continues”  despite the deal for a temporary ceasefire and release of some hostages. At a briefing on Wednesday, he also said part of the deal with Hamas stipulates that representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will be allowed to visit the hostages  that remain in Gaza after some of them are returned. The ICRC earlier on Wednesday said it had “not been made aware of any agreement…related to visits by the ICRC to the hostages”. A coalition of aid agencies have warned that the four-day ceasefire left almost no time to provide effective humanitarian relief to Gaza’s 2.3 million people.  In a briefing on Wednesday, they argued the only effective response  would be a permanent or durable end to the war and that it remained unclear if there would be sufficient access, particularly to the north of the strip, to allow anything beyond cursory relief.Palestinian and Israeli officials have published the names of 300 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons, at least some of whom are expected to be released  in an exchange with Hamas in Gaza for dozens of Israeli hostages seized by the militant group on 7 October. An initial 10 hostages – children or elderly women – are expected to be released on Thursday morning. The families of hostages held in Gaza have said they are living in a “nightmare” as they endure an agonising wait to see if their loves ones are among those freed.  The relatives of some of the 240 hostages in Gaza have said  they were in the dark about who would be released and when. Meanwhile, excitement is also growing for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank that their imprisoned loved ones may also be coming home.More than 100 Palestinians in Gaza – including 50 from one family – were reported killed on Wednesday as Israeli forces continued attacking across the strip from land, sea and air. Wafa, a Palestinian news agency, said 81 people had been killed since midnight as houses were targeted in the centre of the strip. A further 60 were believed to be dead after bombing in and around the Jabaliya refugee camp in the north.The head of the UN children’s agency (Unicef) has called the Gaza Strip “the most dangerous place in the world to be a child” and said that the temporary ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is “far from enough”.  Catherine Russell, addressing the UN security council on Wednesday, also said that “all children inside the territory” were facing “what could soon become a catastrophic nutrition crisis”. The number of journalists killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict since 7 October has increased to at least 53, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).  The funerals were held in Beirut on Wednesday for Al Mayadeen’s reporter Farah Omar and camera operator Rabih al Mamari who were both killed by an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has managed to avert a wider rebellion over the Gaza deal with Hamas among his far-right coalition partners even as Itamar Ben-Gvir, the firebrand national security minister, called it immoral. Israel’s military has said  it intercepted a cruise missile near the southern port city of Eilat.  Eilat is in the south of Israel at the northern tip of the Red Sea, and has previously been targeted during the conflict both by long range fire from the Gaza Strip and by Yemen’s Houthi forces.The western powers on the UN security council face a choice of either demanding Israel lift its stranglehold on humanitarian aid into Gaza or being complicit in Israeli war crimes and collective punishment, foreign ministers from Arab and Muslim countries said on a visit  to London on Wednesday.Pope Francis has faced criticism for allegedly drawing equivalence  between Israel and Hamas.  During a general audience after meeting with Israeli and Palestinian delegations at the Vatican, the pope reportedly remarked: “They suffer so much, I heard how they both suffer.” He went on: “Wars do this, but here we have gone beyond war: this is not war, it is terrorism.”\nblock-time published-time 10.53pm GMT \n There are reports that the son of a senior Hezbollah lawmaker was killed in an Israeli strike in south Lebanon on Wednesday. \n Abbas Raad, son of the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc Mohammed Raad,  “was killed with a number of other Hezbollah members” in an Israeli strike on a house in Beit Yahun, a source close to the family told AFP.\nThe official Lebanese government’s news agency reported that “an air strike launched by the Israeli enemy... on a house in Beit Yahun killed four people”, and wounded others.

But we do know that this deal has passed, it will go through, there will be that tentative temporary ceasefire that will start around 10am tomorrow, local time.\nblock-time published-time 10.11pm GMT \n The latest remarks by  Israel’s national security council chair Tzachi Hanegbi indicate that the release of some hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons has been delayed. \nIn the statement, Hanegbi said that contacts on the deal were continuing, and that the release of hostages will begin “not before Friday”. He did not give an explanation for the delay.\nAn Israeli political source told Haaretz that the delay is because Hamas has not yet submitted the list of Israeli nationals it intends to release. The source also said that Hamas has not ratified the ceasefire agreement with Qatar, which is supposed to guarantee all sides abide by the agreed terms.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 10.16pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 10.02pm GMT \n No hostages to be released before Friday, says senior Israeli official  \nA senior Israeli official has said that the planned exchange of some Palestinians held in Israeli prisons for Israeli hostages in Hamas has been delayed until at least Friday.\nIn a statement, Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said:\nThe release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 10.26pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 9.28pm GMT \n UN humanitarian chief says he hopes pause in hostilities will lead to longer-term ceasefire  \nThe UN humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, has welcomed the agreement of a deal between Israel and Hamas.\nPosting to social media, Griffiths said he hoped the agreement will bring some respite to the people of Gaza and Israel, and that it will allow grieving families to honour their dead and bury them.\nHe said he looked forward to the implementation of the humanitarian pause and “hopes it leads to a longer-term humanitarian ceasefire”, adding:\nHumanitarian agencies are mobilised and ready to increase the volume of aid brought into Gaza and distributed across the Strip.\nenltrI welcome the agreement reached by Israel and Hamas.

Many of the first 50 hostages are expected to come out through Egypt, they said.\nEvery evening before the next day’s release, Israel and Hamas will give the Red Cross the list of hostage and prisoner names being released, they said. Hostages will be brought by the Red Cross to Rafah where they will be met by Israeli soldiers, who will verify that the hostages released are on the list. \nThe hostages will then be taken by helicopter to several designated hospitals in Israel, where their families will finally be able to see them in special areas that are closed to the public, the source said.\nThe first two days of the hostage release will be treated as a “testing period”, after which there is expected to be intense discussions about the potential second phase of the hostage release, they said, adding:\nThe first swap is the most crucial to see that the mechanism is working as was agreed.\nblock-time published-time 9.04pm GMT \n Netanyahu says Red Cross will be able to visit remaining hostages held in Gaza  \n Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking at the press conference just earlier, said part of the hostage deal with Hamas stipulates that representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will be allowed to visit the hostages that remain in Gaza after some of them are returned. He said:\nI expect the Red Cross to do its job, and to visit them all and to bring them the medication that they need.\nThe Israeli prime minister then read out loud verbatim the clause in Hebrew. The Times of Israel reported that the document he appeared to be reading from has not been published.\nNetanyahu’s office claimed on Tuesday night that Israel had successfully negotiated the inclusion of a clause in the hostage deal for the ICRC to visit all the Gaza hostages who remain in Gaza after the deal.\nBut the Red Cross issued a statement on Wednesday morning saying it has not been updated about the plans, which directly involve its staff. The ICRC said:\nSince October 7, 2023, the ICRC has continuously asked for the release of all hostages held in Gaza and their humane treatment. We haven’t stopped doing so and will continue as long as it takes.\nThus far, the ICRC has not been made aware of any agreement reached by both parties related to visits by the ICRC to the hostages. Should visits be agreed upon, the ICRC stands ready to visit. The ICRC does not take part in the negotiations between the parties to the conflict.\nblock-time published-time 8.53pm GMT \n     Picture taken from Rafah, showing a ball of fire lighting the sky during an Israeli strike on eastern Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.

While details are still unclear, a source at the West-Bank based Palestinian Authority told the Guardian  that it is thought that 50 Palestinian women and children will then be dropped off at the Betunia checkpoint, near Ramallah, on Thursday afternoon.\nAs the families of abducted Israelis  endure an agonising wait to see if their loved ones will be able to return, excitement is also growing for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank that their imprisoned loved ones will also be coming home.\n Aseel Osama Shadeh, 17, was arrested earlier this month after carrying a Hamas flag to a protest at the notorious Qalandia checkpoint between Ramallah and Jeruaslem – an offence under Israeli law.\nAccording to the Palestinian Prisoners Society, 7,200 prisoners are currently being held by Israel, among them 88 women and 250 children 17 and under. The plight of prisoners is a key issue for Palestinians: at least four in 10 Palestinian men spend at least some time in their life in Israeli prisons.\nThe hostage swap deal has also shone a light on Israeli detention and sentencing practices in the Palestinian territories , where Palestinians are tried in military courts and minors are regularly imprisoned.\nAll but four on the list of 300 are from the West Bank and Jerusalem. Israel refused to release anyone sentenced for murder; most are held for stone throwing, damaging property, having contact with “hostile” organisations, as well as more serious charges including attempted stabbings and making explosives.\nMany are held in administrative detention , which allows for pre-emptive arrest, on secret evidence, and six-month-long extendable stints in prison without charge or trial.\nblock-time published-time 5.24pm GMT \n Pope Francis has faced criticism for allegedly drawing equivalence between Israel and Hamas. \nDuring a general audience after meeting with Israeli and Palestinian delegations at the Vatican, the pope reportedly remarked, “They suffer so much, I heard how they both suffer.” \nThis statement referred to testimonies brought by the Israeli group, who shared their experiences of having relatives taken hostage by Hamas during the 7 October attacks, as well as the Palestinians with family members living in the targeted enclave.\nContinuing his remarks, Pope Francis stated:\nWars do this, but here we have gone beyond war: this is not war, it is terrorism.\nIn response, members of the Israeli delegation expressed their discontent, citing that there could be no comparison between Hamas, an organisation that employs civilians as shields, and Israel, which defends civilians.\n    Pope Francis meets a delegation of Israelis who have relatives held hostage in Gaza at the studio of Santa Marta in Vatican City. Photograph: Vatican Pool/Getty Images   \n Noemi Di Segni, the president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, also criticised Pope Francis for placing everyone on the same level in terms of responsibility. According to Di Segni, the starting point should be recognised as the terrorism employed in a plan to exterminate Jews worldwide, while war is necessary for the defense of Israel and its people. Di Segni stressed that while there is suffering involved, the blame should be attributed to those truly responsible.\nMeanwhile, Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni addressed claims made by the Palestinian delegation during a press conference in Rome. They asserted that the Pope had recognised the ongoing “genocide” faced by the Palestinian people in their meeting. Bruni, however, refuted this claim, stating that he was not aware of the pope using such terminology. He clarified that the pope’s words during the general audience represented the dire situation experienced in Gaza.\nThe Palestinian delegation also invited the pope to visit Gaza, suggesting that his presence could help stop the war. In response, Pope Francis mentioned that it could be considered when circumstances permit.\n    Pope Francis meets a delegation of families of Palestinians in Gaza at the studio of Paul VI Hall in Vatican City.

But there remain 200,000 to 300,000 civilians still in northern Gaza despite weeks of fighting.\nAgencies present complained that there was no sign of other border crossings being reopened during the four day pause in fighting, leaving aid only able to pass through the crowded Rafah facility, in the south of the strip, where it meets Egypt.\n“There is a logistic limitation into what can enter through the crossing,” at Rafah, said Chiara Saccardi, head of Middle East operations with ActionAid. \nIf you consider that in some of the shelters so you have 20,000 people sheltering and they have available one latrine for 650 persons, then you can only figure what is needed on the ground right now.\nOnly a long term ceasefire and security for aid workers could begin to meet some of the people’s urgent needs, she added.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.19pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 5.09pm GMT \n The head of the UN children’s agency (Unicef), Catherine Russell, welcomed the deal agreed by Israel and Hamas for the release of hostages and a temporary ceasefire but said “much more needs to be done”. \nSpeaking to the UN security council on Wednesday, Russell said:\nFor children to survive, for humanitarian workers to stay and effectively deliver, humanitarian pauses are simply not enough. Unicef is calling for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire to immediately put a stop to this carnage.\nShe said she was concerned that further military escalation in the south of Gaza would “exponentially worsen” the humanitarian situation there, and said attacks on the south “must be avoided”. She added:\nThe true cost of this latest war in Palestine and Israel will be measured in children’s lives – those lost to the violence and those forever changed by it. Without an end to the fighting and full humanitarian access, the cost will continue to grow exponentially.\nblock-time published-time 5.01pm GMT \n Temporary ceasefire in Gaza to come into effect on Thursday morning, say Hamas and Israel officials  \nThe first ceasefire in seven weeks of war in Gaza is due to come into effect on Thursday morning, officials from both Hamas and Israel have said.\nThe four-day truce, announced early this morning,  is slated to begin at 10am local time (08:00 GMT) on Thursday, an Israeli official told  CNN today.\nSenior Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk also told  Al Jazeera that the temporary cease-fire will start at 10am local time. Marzouk said the pause in fighting would cover “all regions the of Gaza Strip”, adding that “there will be no warplanes or air traffic in Gaza from 10am to 4pm”.\nAn Egyptian security source told Reuters that mediators wanted a start time of 10am on Thursday, with Hamas seeking a few hours from the start to begin freeing hostages.\nUnder the agreement, Hamas will free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages  they took on 7 October. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.\nThere will be a halt to Israeli air sorties over southern Gaza, with air activity over northern Gaza restricted to six hours a day.

Based on these figures, children account for 40% of the deaths in Gaza. This is unprecedented. In other words, today, the Gaza Strip is the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.\nThe UN agency has received reports that more than 1,200 Palestinian children remain under the rubble of bombed-out buildings or are otherwise unaccounted for, she added.\nFor the children who manage to survive the war, they are “likely to see their lives irrevocably altered through repeated exposure to traumatic events”, Russell said.\nShe said she was particularly concerned by reports of increasing numbers of displaced children who have been separated from their families as they fled south, or who have arrived unaccompanied to hospitals for medical care.\nThese children are especially vulnerable, and they urgently need to be identified, provided with temporary care, and given access to family tracing and reunification services.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 4.56pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.15pm GMT \n Reactions among leading Israeli columnists on Wednesday reflected the continuing political problems that Benjamin Netanyahu is facing even as he tries to sell the deal. \n Nahum Barnea, a journalist for the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, suggested that “Israel has no choice but to pay the price” while linking the agreement with the failures of 7 October.\nThe alternative to forsaking the hostages a second time, after they were first forsaken on October, would have been far worse and far more dangerous. Beyond the price it could end up costing in blood and lives, it would have left an indelible stain on the Israeli government and the IDF.\nOthers were more damning still. Also writing in Yedioth, Yossi Yehoshua warned that Israel risked missing “an historic opportunity to fundamentally change the Gaza problem, and will not only pay for that in soldiers’ lives but by missing out on a better deal”, adding “we are jeopardising our most important war in recent decades.

This floundering might work for him.\nNetanyahu already realises that he is going to be remembered in infamy as the man who with his own two hands moulded this crisis.

Here are the headlines:\nFifty women and children held hostage by Hamas and other groups in Gaza since 7 October are to be released in exchange for a four-day ceasefire in a deal brokered by Qatar with the support of the US.  According to Hamas, Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails and allow hundreds of aid trucks a day to cross the Rafah border with Egypt, providing humanitarian supplies to Palestinians in Gaza.Over a hundred Palestinians in Gaza were reported killed on Wednesday as Israeli forces continued attacking across the strip from land, sea and air ahead of the temporary truce.  Lt Col Richard Hecht, the IDF’s international spokesperson, told a briefing: “We still have probably, maybe a day-plus before this thing matures, and things can happen in that day. And I assume today is going to be a day of fighting in Gaza.”The agreement pauses a war that has lasted more than six weeks so far. It has cost the lives of at least 14,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the government media office in Gaza, and more than 1,200 people in Israel, most of whom were victims of the surprise Hamas cross-border attack on 7 October. Unconfirmed media reports have suggested a ceasefire might start at 10am Thursday (8am GMT). The casualty figures issued during the conflict have not been independently verified by journalists.The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the hostage deal was “the result of tireless diplomacy and relentless effort across the department and broader US government”. “While this deal marks significant progress, we will not rest as long as Hamas continues to hold hostages in Gaza,” Blinken said.Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran ’s foreign minister, is to make a regional tour following the announcement of the deal.Israel’s military on Wednesday claimed that during its campaign in Gaza it has “exposed and destroyed approximately 400 terror tunnel shafts”. It said “Hamas has embedded its network of terrorist tunnels below population centres across the Gaza Strip. Many of the shafts leading to its tunnel network are located within civilian hospitals, schools and homes”. The claims have not been independently verified.The Palestine Red Crescent Society said it had sent 14 ambulances to evacuate patients from al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza.The number of journalists killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict since 7 October has increased to at least 53, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).  The funerals were held in Beirut Wednesday for Al Mayadeen’s reporter Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih al Mamari who were both killed by an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday.Six Palestinians were shot dead in an Israeli raid in the northern city of Tulkarm in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority’s health ministry said.Syria ’s army said on Wednesday that Israel launched aerial strikes on outposts in the vicinity of Damascus but that nobody was injured or killed.Jordan ’s King Abdullah is going to Cairo today for talks with the Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, on how to end “Israel’s aggression against the Palestinians”, a palace statement said.The EU’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said he has been told by the Palestinian Authority that 40% of housing has been demolished in Gaza.Pope Francis on Wednesday met separately with relatives of Israeli hostages in Gaza and of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, saying both sides “suffer so much”.

All are now crammed into the south, which has been without adequate food, fuel, clean water, shelter and much else for almost seven weeks after Israel cut off supplies.\nAny cessation of hostilities and promises of increased aid will provide only very partial relief to the shattered, battered and grieving inhabitants of the the territory.\nOne UN official who has spent six weeks living in a compound near Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, with his family, told the Guardian on Wednesday: “I wish that once the ceasefire starts it opens the way for political solution, but it’s not clear yet … It also it makes us think: what are we going to do when the war ends? Where to go when most of the people, and I am one of them, have lost their home? Where to live, when there is no infrastructure, no schools, no hospitals? It would take years just to remove the rubble.”\nThe deal will also provide only partial relief to the families of those 239 mainly Israeli hostages thought to be in Gaza. Even for families whose relatives are not immediately released, the deal offers hope. But for the families and friends of captured military personnel, possibly numbering about 100, there is the deeply distressing knowledge that these are the most valuable to Hamas and so will be the last to be freed.\n Read more of Jason Burke’s analysis here: Gaza ceasefire deal brings relief but little hope of durable peace\n Related:  Gaza ceasefire deal brings relief but little hope of durable peace\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.39pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 1.27pm GMT \nPlumes of dust and smoke continued to rise on the horizon across the Gaza-Israel border on Wednesday despite Israel and Hamas agreeing to a ceasefire of at least four days to let in aid and release at least 50 Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

Speaking at the virtual G20 meeting, the Russian president gave his most pacific comments yet since invading Ukraine, but then blamed Kyiv for no peace talks.Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s troops faced “difficult” defensive operations on parts of the eastern front, as bitter winter cold settles in. But the president added forces in the south were still conducting offensive actions.The death toll from a Russian strike on a Ukrainian hospital in Selydove rose to three people. After Tuesday’s attack, rescuers spent the night clearing rubble and discovered further casualties.The Russian foreign ministry said relations with the US were extremely thin and risked being torn at any moment. Spokesperson Maria Zakharova told reporters Washington’s actions could lead to “unpredictable consequences.”Finland prime minister Petteri Orpo said the country will shut three border crossings after Helsinki accused the Kremlin of pushing hundreds of asylum seekers to the border in recent weeks. \nIt leaves just one crossing open in its 1,340km border with Russia, also the Nato and EU border.Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, is threatening to block Ukraine’s candidacy for membership of the EU. European leaders will meet on 14 and 15 December to discuss Ukraine’s EU bid.The European Council president, Charles Michel, said he expected a“difficult” meeting next month about Ukraine joining the EU. He promised to do “everything in my power” to make a decision in December.The EU has approved a further €1.5bn (£1.3bn) payment in macro financial assistance to Ukraine. It is the tenth payment made as part of an €18bn programme to keep the Ukrainian economy moving.Russia’s defence ministry said a group of Russian journalists had come under drone attack from Ukrainian forces in the Zaporizhzhia region. It said one reporter received medical treatment but no one was life-threateningly injured.A Russian independent politician was summoned to a local prosecutor’s office after declaring her intention to run in next year’s presidential election. She had been critical of the regime.The Kremlin said there were “no revisions” to its policy of pardoning prisoners in exchange for fighting in Ukraine. It followed local media reports of a Russian “satanist” killer who was released.The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 14 Shahed drones launched by Russian forcesovernight. There were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage.The US voiced concern that Iran may provide Russia with ballistic missiles for use in its war against Ukraine. The national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said the development would probably be disastrous for the Ukrainian people.The UN human rights office said more than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion.  It expects the real toll is significantly higher.\nThat’s all from me, Jem Bartholomew, taking charge of our live coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine today. See you next time.\nblock-time published-time 6.19pm GMT \nA 17-year-old Russian has been sentenced to six years in a juvenile penal colony for throwing molotov cocktails at army recruitment offices, the latest ruling in Moscow’s crackdown against dissent over its invasion of Ukraine.\nYegor Balazeikin, then a student at a prestigious high school in St Petersburg specialising in social sciences, threw homemade molotov cocktails, but they failed to ignite.\nBalazeikin “has no regrets” over his actions, his mother said, but according to supporters, he has suffered worsening health conditions while in custody – including autoimmune hepatitis and liver fibrosis.\nAFP has a reporter at the court in St Petersburg:\nBalazeikin said he had targeted the enlistment buildings in Saint Petersburg and in his hometown of Kirovsk, 30 kilometres (20 miles) east of St Petersburg, in protest at Russia’s offensive on Ukraine.\nHis uncle was killed a few months after volunteering to fight at the start of the conflict.\nMoscow has taken a harsh line against public shows of dissent and opposition to its actions in Ukraine.\nRussian courts have sentenced several individuals to multiple years in prison - also on ‘terrorism’ charges - for attempted attacks on military and government buildings.\nDuring the trial, Balazeikin admitted to throwing the Molotov cocktails, but said he did not agree with the classification of his actions as a ‘terrorist act’.\n‘I believe that if people en masse expressed their dissatisfaction - not necessarily in the way I did - it will lead to the end of this war and the saving of lives,’ the independent Sota outlet quoted him as saying in court.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.00pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 6.10pm GMT \n Russia lifted a temporary ban on diesel exports on Wednesday, saying the two-month restrictions had been successful in bringing down rising fuel prices on the domestic market, AFP reports.\nMoscow suspended the export of diesel and gasoline products in September in a move that roiled global markets.\nThe energy ministry said it had taken the measures to boost supplies inside Russia and bring down rising prices that were hitting drivers and businesses across the country.\nOn Wednesday, it said it was removing the restrictions after prices had dropped and domestic reserves had grown 14% to 3.2m tonnes during the two months when exports were curtailed.\nIt follows the lifting last month of restrictions on Russia’s seaborne diesel exports, which make up the majority, and last week’s removal of a suspension on gasoline exports.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.00pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 5.51pm GMT \n Death toll from Russian strike on Ukrainian hospital rises to three people  \nThe death toll from a Russian strike on a hospital has risen to three people, emergency services in Ukraine ’s southern town of Selydove have said.\nThe strike on Tuesday damaged two hospital buildings – injuring at least eight people – and a coal mine – Reuters reports, citing local Ukrainian authorities.\nAfter clearing rubble overnight, the state emergency service said on Telegram on Wednesday: “Another body was recovered from the rubble of the hospital building. In total, three people were killed in the missile strike.”\nMoscow denies targeting civilians. But the United Nations says more than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion. It expects the actual toll to be significantly higher.\n Related:  Can hospitals be military targets?

The border also marks the frontiers of Nato an the European Union. Estonia, another Nato and EU member, also says Russia is pushing asylum seekers to its border as a form of hybrid “warfare”.\nFinland’s closures will begin at midnight on Friday. The Raja-Jooseppi crossing, in the far northern Lapland region, will remain open and asylum applications will be processed there, Reuters reports.\n“The government has today decided to close more border posts,” Orpo told a press conference. “Raja-Jooseppi is the northernmost [crossing] and it requires a real effort to get there”.\nDestitute and desparate people with few possessions – often from war torn countries like Syria, Yemen and Somalia – have become political footballs in a clash between Finland and Estonia against Russia at the borders of the western alliance.\n    Cars at the border between Russia and Finland at the Nuijamaa border check point in Lappeenranta, Finland, on November 14, 2023.

Finland and Estonia say they have seen a surge in migrants arriving in the past two weeks and accuse Moscow of facilitating the arrivals.\nThe office of Estonia’s interior minister, Lauri Laanemets, told Reuters: “Unfortunately, there are many signs that Russian border officials and possibly other agencies are involved”. Laanemets added: “Quite frankly, [the] ongoing migration pressure on Europe’s eastern border is a hybrid attack operation”.\nEstonia’s interior ministry said 75 people – largely from Somalia and Syria – attempted to enter from Russia since Thursday but said they were turned back.\nFinland’s foreign minister on Wednesday told Reuters it demanded Russia stops sending people to the border, and said the country was considering closing all border crossings. The Kremlin denies pushing asylum seekers to the borders.\nThe issue has become a point of contention between the two EU and Nato members and Russia, as they tussle over the fates of asylum seekers from often war-torn countries who have few possessions and face hostility and destitution.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.04pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.36pm GMT \n Finland ’s foreign minister demanded Russia stops sending people to the border, claiming to have evidence the Russian border service is transporting asylum seekers to crossings – as tensions between the two countries continue to simmer.\nThe foreign minister, Elina Valtonen, told Reuters on Wednesday that one alternative is to close the entire 1,340km border it shares with Russia – which is also the border of Nato and the EU – if asylum seekers from its neighbour continue to arrive.\nValtonen said: “We have already taken measures to close border crossing points, and if need be, we will be doing further closings.”\nHelsinki has shut several crossings and is considering closing some of the four remaining border points on its Russian frontier, Reuters reports. Moscow denies sending people to the border.\nAround 600 people have arrived in the past few weeks, Finland told Reuters. The asylum seekers come from a wide range of nations including Yemen, Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria, according to immigration authorities.\nAn announcement from Finland is expected at 5pm GMT. Earlier on Wednesday, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said Russia would “of course” respond if Finland closes the remaining border posts.\nIt comes after Russia said on Wednesday it had protested to Finland after a damaged Russian tank was placed on display near the Finnish parliament.\nThe issue has become a point of contention between Finland and Estonia against Russia, as they tussle over the fates of asylum seekers from often war-torn countries who have few possessions and face hostility and destitution.\n    Finland’s minister for foreign affairs, Elina Valtonen.

The interference can involve jamming satellite signals by drowning them out with noise, or spoofing them – mimicking real satellite signals to trick recipients with misleading information.\nThe radio interference has so far not proven to be dangerous. But aircraft systems have proved largely unable to detect GPS spoofing and correct for it, according to Opsgroup, an organization that monitors changes and risks in the aviation industry. One Embraer jet bound for Dubai nearly veered into Iranian airspace in September before the pilots figured out the plane was chasing a false signal.\n“We only realized there was an issue because the autopilot started turning to the left and right, so it was obvious that something was wrong,” crew members reported to Opsgroup.\nAirplanes can typically fly safely without satellite signals and large commercial aircraft have at least six alternative navigation systems, pilots said. Business jets such as Dassault Falcons, Gulfstreams and Bombardiers appear to be more susceptible to signal spoofing, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said.\nThe strain on aviation could be a harbinger of far-reaching economic and security problems as the weapons of electronic warfare proliferate.\n     A Ukraine International Airlines plane.

Zakharova blamed Finland for the problems but said:\nWe are open to dialogue, particularly on border-related issues.\nRussia will “of course” respond if Finland closes the remaining border posts between the two countries, Zakharova said, without specifying what its reaction would be.\nblock-time published-time 1.40pm GMT \n Putin says Russia 'ready for talks' to end the 'tragedy' of war in Ukraine but then blames Kyiv for no peace talks  \n Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is “ready for talks” to end the “tragedy” of war in Ukraine but blamed a Kyiv law prohibiting talks.\nThe Russian president launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year that has devastated the country and led to hundreds of thousands of casualties , both military and civilian, as well as Russian troops suspected of massacres in places such as Bucha. \nPutin used his speech at the G20 meeting to say it was necessary to think about how to stop the tragedy of the conflict in Ukraine, Reuters reports, and said Russia had never refused to participate in peace talks with Ukraine.\n“Military actions are always a tragedy,” Putin said to the virtual meeting. “And of course, we should think about how to stop this tragedy,” Putin said. “By the way, Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine.”\n Ukraine ’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, signed a decree in October 2022  formally declaring the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with Putin “impossible” but leaving the door open to discussions with Russia.\nPutin also used the speech to discuss wider geopolitical issues, saying a large share of economic activity is shifting to Asia and Africa. He said Russia had shipped grain to Africa free of charge, and emphasised the country’s willingness to contribute to global climate and development goals – in words that will be interpreted by many as attempts to spread Russia’s zones of influence further in the global south.\n    Vladimir Putin holds a video conference with members of the Russian government.

The US has spent billions of dollars in military and financial aid to Ukraine; and Russia has grown closer to Hamas since its attacks on Israel on 7 October, according to  the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nYou can watch Zakharova’s conference in full here. \n    Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry’s spokesperson, has spoken of ‘unpredictable consequences’.

He said the US would be watching to see whether that happened and was prepared to use “counter-terrorism sanctions authority against Russian individuals or entities that might make these destabilizing transfers”.\nThe US says the Kremlin’s reliance on Iran, as well as North Korea – countries largely isolated on the international stage for their nuclear programmes and human rights records – shows desperation.\nUS officials say Iran has also provided Russia with artillery and tank rounds for its invasion of Ukraine.\nThe US and other countries have taken steps to thwart the potential supply, sale or transfer involving Iran and ballistic missile-related items, Kirby said.

The additional aid for Ukraine is part of a larger $106bn funding request from the Democratic president that also would support Israel, Taiwan and the US operations on the border with Mexico.\nA growing group of lawmakers in the Republican party, which controls the House of Representatives, opposes sending more money to Ukraine.

Here are some of the most recent developments:\nUkrainian air defences shot down all 14 Shahed drones launched by Russian forces in an overnight attack, the air force said this morning. The attack on Ukraine’s central, south-eastern, and western regions lasted from 8pm on Tuesday until 3am on Wednesday. There were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage.The air force also said that the Russian military launched an X-22 missile in Zaporizhzhia region in the south-east but the missile failed to reach its target, falling into a field.For their part, the Russians said their anti-aircraft units destroyed three Ukrainian drones over the Crimean peninsula.The White House says it is concerned Iran may provide ballistic missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine. “In return for that support, Russia has been offering Tehran unprecedented defence cooperation, including on missiles, electronics and air defence,” said John Kirby, US national security council spokesperson.President Joe Biden’s request for more than $61bn in emergency US funding to support Ukraine’s defence remains stalled in Congress. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has announced the Pentagon will in any case be sending an additional $100m in weapons to Ukraine from existing US stockpiles, including  another  Himars mobile artillery system.More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, with about half of recent deaths occurring far behind the frontlines, the UN human rights office said. Its mission in Ukraine, which has dozens of monitors, said it expected the real toll to be “significantly higher” since its work was continuing.Germany will support Ukraine with a further military aid package worth €1.3bn (£1.1bn) that will include an additional IRIS-T air defence unit, Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, has said.Russia has not used its “premier air-launched cruise missiles” from its heavy bombers for nearly two months, likely allowing it to build up a substantial stock  that could be used  in a repeat of last year’s campaign to destroy Ukraine’s critical national infrastructure, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in an intelligence update.Russian forces hit port infrastructure in Ukraine’s southern city of Odesa on Tuesday evening, the regional governor said, adding that no one was injured. The Ukrainian southern military command also reported strikes on the Belhorod-Dniester district south-west of Odesa, with missiles hitting open ground and administrative buildings. Ukraine is maintaining a humanitarian corridor into the Black Sea to circumvent Russia’s de facto port blockade.A Slovakian border crossing with Ukraine was blocked on Tuesday, it was reported, although the Slovakian haulers’ union played it down as involving a single truck. Ukrainian truckers have been exempt from seeking border crossing permits since Russia’s invasion. Polish and Slovakian drivers say that has undercut business and they want restrictions imposed.The European Council’s president, Charles Michel, on a visit to Kyiv said he expected a “difficult” meeting next month about Ukraine joining the EU. The European Commission has recommended opening formal membership negotiations but talks cannot start unless all 27 member states agree.“I will do everything in my power to convince my colleagues that we need a decision in December,” Michel told the Ukrainian president. Volodymyr Zelenskiy was quoted by AFP as saying: “We believe that the EU will be ready to do its part … so that by the end of the year in December, the result will be a political decision to start accession negotiations.”\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 10.25am GMT\nEnd of Document\nMorning Mail: house prices back at record level, Australia’s generational shift, blast at US-Canada border"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28
"Despite the truce, people in Gaza will keep dying – this horrifying death toll must never be forgotten","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 09:02:00," OPINION; Version:3",1047," Owen Jones"," Comparison with other conflicts paints a harrowing picture of children being killed in unforgivable numbers","\nEven if the truce  between Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and Hamas results in the promised four-day pause in hostilities – or longer – the horror enveloping Gaza in terms of lives lost is worse than many people think. Among those who oppose Israel’s onslaught, there are still those who do not truly grasp it. It’s understandable that Israeli authorities are seeking to sow doubt about the size of the death toll, because the numbers expose the gravity of the crimes being committed. But we should not be deceived.\nTake the argument that the health ministry is Hamas-run and, therefore, its figures can never be trusted. It sounds like a reasonable enough claim on the surface, until you realise that in previous conflicts the death toll reported by the ministry was largely consistent with the UN’s and even Israel’s counts. Last month, after doubts were raised by President Biden, the ministry even released the names, ages and identification numbers of the victims.\nIndeed, the health ministry’s official estimate – currently 13,300 dead after six weeks – could well be an underestimate, as a senior US official has conceded.  The figures do not include the dead buried under rubble who have not been retrieved. According to the independent Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, which is chaired by US emeritus law professor and former UN special rapporteur on Palestine, Richard Falk, the civilian death toll  as of 20 November is 16,413, with nearly 34,000 injured. This would mean one in every 142 Palestinian civilians killed in a month and a half. \nGiven that this slaughter may not end soon, the current health ministry tally of 13,300 dead, when placed in the context of Gaza’s population of 2.2 million, tells us something about the sheer scale of what has happened. Comparisons with other conflicts are truly eye-opening here. The Bosnian war loomed over my own childhood as a case study of an unspeakable atrocity. About 40,000 civilians died in those killing fields  in the years between 1992 and 1995. That was over three years, not six weeks, and it was in a country whose prewar population was about twice that of Gaza. \nBut aren’t many of the deaths in Gaza not civilians, but Hamas militants, you might ask? The evidence suggests not. Research by the Iraq Body Count project, which diligently compiled violent civilian deaths after the 2003 invasion, concluded last month  about Gaza that “few of the victims can have been combatants”. Analysing the ministry of health data, they found only a “modest excess of adult males killed”, which could be explained by their greater exposure to risk in, for instance, rescue efforts. With an estimated 70% of the dead being women and children – and many of the slain men unlikely to have been combatants – their conclusion is difficult to rebut.\nWe could also make a comparison with the war in Syria, rightly regarded as one of the great moral obscenities of our age. The UN estimates  that nearly 307,000 civilians have met violent ends since 2011. Its prewar population was just over 10 times that of Gaza.  This means that after just six weeks, the death rate of Palestinians is approaching half that of Syrians after a decade of war.\nAnother comparison is Yemen. This is a tragedy close to my heart: I’ve written multiple columns  about the western-backed Saudi onslaught and visited a Yemeni refugee camp , where children drew pictures of dead relatives slain by bombs. An estimated 15,000 Yemeni civilians were killed by direct military action between 2015 and 2021, mostly by Saudi-led airstrikes. This is comparable to Gaza, except Yemen’s average population in these war years was 14 times greater than Gaza’s, and this death toll was amassed over six years, not six weeks.\nIt might be countered that Yemen’s death toll is actually closer to 377,000, because of deaths from indirect causes, such as a lack of access to food, water and healthcare. But, of course, the same will be true of Gaza under siege and that figure will only become clear after the current bloodshed is over.\nA comparison of child deaths across conflicts, macabre as it is, underlines the unique nature of this conflict in Gaza. In the first two years of the Syrian war, children were estimated to represent roughly 10% of deaths , in Iraq since 2003, 8.6% and in Ukraine since the invasion, 6%. In Gaza, they represent an estimated 42% of deaths. \nNo comparison is perfect and every tragedy must be understood on its own terms. Yet these numbers give a sense of the unusually brutal scale of what is happening in Gaza. It is not as if the realities on the ground are hidden. Thanks to courageous journalists and media workers – dozens now killed – we have evidence of the civilian toll in the most graphic detail possible. So where is the urgency on behalf of western politicians and many media outlets to put a stop to this? Why doesn’t it rival their justified disgust at the horrors unleashed by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine? Few cheerleaders of Israel’s invasion have been able to admit that Hamas’s obscene atrocities of 7 October do not justify civilian death on this scale. \nThis truce is welcome but the widespread destruction of infrastructure will mean people keep dying long after the bombs stop falling. And with Israel’s stated desire to occupy Gaza “for an indefinite period” , much violence is surely yet to come. We are left with a bleak conclusion. There isn’t even a pretence that Palestinian life matters. An Israeli civilian death toll of more than 1,000 was rightly understood to be intolerable, but there appears no limit to how many Gazans can meet violent ends. This brazen disregard for innocent life has barely been discussed in the west. It has been widely understood beyond in the Arab world and much of the global south, though, and it will not be forgotten.\n                                                               Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist                                                                     Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The chancellor allocated £4bn to pay for the expanded offer, but many providers have said this will not be enough to prevent them going bankrupt.\n Related:  Hunt criticised by boss of childcare company that Sunak’s wife invests in\nblock-time published-time 7.33pm GMT \nThe chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, unveiled plans that could eventually give UK workers one pension pot for life – but there were warnings that it could be an administrative “nightmare”.\nThe shake-up is aimed at tackling the problem of millions of small pension pots being generated – which often then end up being forgotten about – as savers change jobs during their working lives.\nThe Treasury said it was launching a call for evidence on a “lifetime provider” model that would simplify the market by allowing savers to ask employers to pay into one portable pension pot. The pot could be moved from one job to the next.\nThe Treasury said  the measure would provide savers with “greater agency and control over their pension”.\nResponding to the announcement, Rachel Vahey, head of policy development at investment platform AJ Bell, said: “Some estimates suggest the average worker changes employer around 11 times during their career, with each job hop potentially creating a new pension with a new provider.”\n Related:  Hunt’s pension ‘pot for life’ idea would be nightmare to establish, experts say\nblock-time published-time 7.16pm GMT \nJeremy Hunt said he would look to cut income tax at the next budget “if it is responsible to do so”.\nAsked whether taxes were going up or down under the current government, the Chancellor told Sky News: “We haven’t got to the end of the Parliament yet, so I can’t answer that question.\n“But what I can say is that my commitment to voters is that, when I had a chance to lighten the tax burden… I’m a Conservative, I believe in doing so.\n“We have made a start. I don’t pretend, I’ve never pretended that we were going to get there in one go.\n“But what we can say is that, now we’ve halved inflation, the economy has turned a corner, we can focus on the long-term growth, raising incomes and salaries for families up and down the country.”\nAsked whether income tax could be cut in the spring budget, Hunt said: “What I will do is exactly what I’ve done this time. If it is responsible to do so, if we can do so without increasing borrowing, then of course as a Conservative, I would like to bring down the tax burden.\n“But I will only do so in a responsible way and one that doesn’t fuel inflation after the great success we’ve had in halving it.”\nblock-time published-time 7.08pm GMT \nJeremy Hunt has paved the way for a renewed period of “implausible austerity” after announcing deep real-terms cuts to public spending after the next election.\nHunt has projected day-to-day departmental expenditure increasing by an average of just 0.9% in real terms from 2025, with public investment spending fixed in cash terms, leaving a future government with a “stark choice” between further tax rises or making deep cuts to public service  s.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) appeared to cast doubt on the feasibility of the government’s tight post-election spending plans in its assessment of the chancellor’s autumn statement.\nThe OBR warned persistently high inflation  would slash the real value of government departmental spending by £19.1bn by 2027-28, compared with its estimates from the spring.\nThe watchdog made clear that would “present challenges”, including for local councils. It pointed to the fact that demand for public services is expected to grow and warned that local authorities’ abilities to borrow and spend would be constrained.\n Related:  Hunt ‘will create implausible austerity with post-election public spending cuts’\nblock-time published-time 7.02pm GMT \nTwo thirds (67%) of UK adults support the National Insurance rate cut from 12% to 10% announced in today’s Autumn Statement, with just one in eight (12%) opposing it, according to a snap reactions poll from Savanta.\nThe poll, conducted in the wake of the Chancellor’s statement to the House of Commons, finds a majority (58%) broadly support the package of policies announced by the Chancellor today, including almost three-quarters (72%) of those that voted Conservative in 2019.\nHowever, despite the popular package announced today, almost half (49%) of all UK adults disagree with the Chancellor’s assertion that the government’s economic plan for the country is working, including a third (35%) of 2019 Conservative voters.\nblock-time published-time 6.47pm GMT \nSpeaking in a pre-recorded interview on Peston, which airs on ITV1 at 10.45pm today, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt MP admitted his new measures for growth would take a long time to kick in. \n“The supply side measures, the measures that will boost investment in the economy by businesses, which is the way we get productivity, salaries, living standards up, they will take a decade to happen.”\nAsked about the OBR downgrading its prediction for the UK’s growth rate to 1.6 percent, Hunt implied it had been too optimistic previously, saying: “Well, in fairness, the OBR were the most optimistic of all the forecasters. They’ve just changed their growth rate to the average of other forecasts.”\nblock-time published-time 6.39pm GMT \nChristine Espley, a self-employed 61-year-old chef and caterer from Cirencester, has been unable to work since the summer because of extreme mobility issues. She has been waiting 47 weeks for a hip operation and fears she may lose her small benefit income because of planned changes to the welfare system.\nPeople with mobility and mental health problems will be asked to work from home or lose benefits as part of what a UK government minister described this week as doing “their duty”.  The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, doubled down on the controversial policy in his autumn statement on Wednesday , claiming that the government’s so-called back-to-work plan would help nearly 700,000 people with health conditions find work.\nIn December last year, Espley was referred to a consultant who agreed that hip replacement surgery was necessary. “I’ve been waiting for 47 weeks,” she said.\n Related:  ‘Made to feel like a scrounger’: chef waiting for hip operation fears losing £84-a-week benefit\nblock-time published-time 6.28pm GMT \n Jeremy Hunt says it will 'take time' to reduce overall tax burden  \nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said he accepted it is “going to take time” to reduce the overall tax burden. \nThe senior Conservative made the comment when it was put to him that taxes for some people would still rise due to tax thresholds remaining frozen, despite national insurance being cut in the autumn statement.\nHe told Sky News: “If you’re trying to say that it is going to take time to get taxes down to the levels they were, then I agree.\n“But what I said was that, when it was responsible to do so, when it wouldn’t affect inflation, I would make a start.\n“We have done that today and we are a party that believes that, if we want to grow the economy, then we need to have a lightly taxed economy.\n“And we have made a step which, by the way, for someone on average earnings is going to be about £450, so it is not insignificant.”\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.33pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 6.21pm GMT \nJeremy Hunt has gone from “hero to zero on social care”, according to campaigners who branded the absence of any new funding commitments to the struggling sector “shameful”.\nThe only mention of social care in this week’s autumn statement was to “reaffirm” the commitments made at the 2022 statement, when the government pledged to make available up to £14.1 billion for the NHS and adult social care.\nAge UK noted the 2019 pledge by then-prime minister Boris Johnson to “fix the crisis in social care once and for all” and said Wednesday’s statement was “a reminder of how desperately short the government has fallen”.\nThe Carers Trust said it was “shameful” than none of 110 measures announced by the Chancellor “gets anywhere near easing a social care crisis that is causing so much suffering for so many”.\nCarers UK described it as “bitterly disappointing that the government has – yet again – failed to acknowledge the devastating impact the lack of funding for health and social care services is having on millions of unpaid carers supporting older and disabled family members”.\nMeanwhile, the Children’s Charities Coalition, which includes Barnardo’s, The Children’s Society, National Children’s Bureau and NSPCC, said young people are being “left behind in the UK” as they urged a significant investment in children’s social care.\nblock-time published-time 6.06pm GMT \n George Osborne says Hunt has now made it easier for Sunak to call election in May  \n George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor, thinks Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement is partly about making a May general election an option. But Osborne does not necessarily think it will happen. This is what he said today on his Political Currency podcast with Ed Balls.\nA lot of people … are going to conclude that [this makes a May election more likely.] And for this reason, [Hunt has] delivered a tax cut and he’s insisted that it’s taking effect from January. In other words, you’re going to start to feel the effects by May. \nHe’s not cut income tax, which leaves open a cut in income tax in a spring budget, and the Conservatives now know, if the forecasts are right, that they’re not going to be fighting the election in the autumn against a backdrop of an improving economy and falling inflation. In fact, things are going to feel pretty stagnant next year. \nI had already detected and picked up talk of potentially an earlier election. At least as an option. Because they’ve got other issues as well. The Rwanda judgments and all of that. The longer they leave it might make it worse. \nPersonally, I think any prime minister may think they might want to go to the country in May. But when they are 20-odd points behind in the polls and assuming that hasn’t changed dramatically by May, they’re going to go, ‘maybe I’ll wait till the autumn or maybe even wait till the beginning of 2025’ ….\nBut I’ll tell you what Jeremy Hunt is doing. He is following the Lynton Crosby law, which is: you can’t fatten the pig on market day. Lynton Crosby is the Tory election strategist of previous elections who told us as MPs – I remember I was a pretty young MP in 2005 – that you can’t just fire all your ammunition at the general election, you have to make your party attractive and you need to make people feel the benefits of your policies in the many, many months in the run up to that election. \nSo I think Jeremy Hunt is opening the door to a May election, even though I think it’s unlikely Rishi Sunak will walk through it.\nThat’s all from Graeme Wearden and me for today.

It says the richest 20% will get almost half of the money available. Or, as it puts it, “for every £100 Hunt spent on personal tax cuts, £46 will benefit the richest fifth of households. Only £3 of every £100 of tax cuts will go to the worst-off families.”\n    Distributional impact of tax cuts Photograph: IPPR   \nThis one shows how much workers on different salaries will gain, both in cash terms per week and as a proportion of their post-tax income.

It says:\nLondon and the south-east of England are the biggest winners with an average annual gain per working age person of £316 and £290 respectively.

They also disproportionately benefit the richest areas of the country most – the opposite of levelling up.\nMore broadly these tax cuts are accompanied by plans to make deep cuts in public services and investment in the future - an approach that commands very little support from the public and will make it harder, not easier, for the UK economy to grow as it needs to.\nblock-time published-time 5.07pm GMT \n Hunt thanks Tory MPs pledging not to vote for tax rises that increase overall tax burden  \nMore than 30 Conservative MPs have backed a campaign led by Sir Jake Berry, a former party chair, which involves them signing a pledge not to vote for new taxes that increase the overall tax burden.\n Jeremy Hunt has now written to Berry assuring him that there is nothing in the autumn statement that goes against this.

The government clearly thinks the crumbs they offered parents during the Spring Statement is enough - it is not.\nUnfortunately, we won’t see the impact until April when parents struggle to access the childcare funding they were promised, because there are no places available.“\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 4.43pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.28pm GMT \n OBR says almost half of Hunt's autumn statement 'headroom' explained by fuel duty rise that's unlikely to happen  \nThe autumn statement assumes that, at the end of the forecast period (2028-29), the Treasury will have “headroom” (spare cash) worth £13bn, or 0.4% of GDP. Jeremy Hunt boasted about this in his speech , saying:\nWe therefore meet our fiscal rule to have underlying debt falling as a percentage of GDP in the final year of the forecast, with double the headroom compared to the OBR’s March forecast.\nBut the OBR in its report  says that almost half of this “headroom” is explained by a forecast rise in fuel duty that will probably never happen.\nIt also suggests that £13bn is not much to boast about anyway and that, without the proposed spending cuts deemed unrealistic (see 3.02pm  ), Hunt would not have any headroom at all. It says:\nHeadroom of £13bn is considerably lower than the average of £29.7bn that chancellors have held against their fiscal rules since 2010. Our forecast again incorporates £6.2bn of extra revenue in 2028-29 from the government’s stated policy of increasing fuel duty rates in line with RPI inflation and the reversal of the ‘temporary’ 5p cut. If, like all chancellors since 2011, rates are instead held at the current rate then more than 43% of the headroom in 2028-29 would be removed and debt would no longer be falling in 2027-28. The current headroom is also less than it would have cost to maintain the real value of departmental spending at the same level as in our March forecast.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 4.45pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.27pm GMT \n The alcohol and pubs industries have toasted measures in the autumn statement  aimed at providing some relief to the struggling sector. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, froze alcohol duty and extended 75% business rates relief for hospitality and leisure firms, prolonging a measure initially introduced to help an industry that was hit harder than most by social distancing and lockdowns during the pandemic. The tax break was due to end on 1 August, fuelling fears of a sudden increase in costs that would have been nearly £13,000 a year for the average pub against a backdrop of rising closure rates. Relief will now last for another year. Hunt also froze the small business rates multiplier, the methodology used to calculate bills for the tax. The British Beer & Pubs Association said the measures would save the sector £350m a year, while the Wine & Spirits Trade Association called the duty freeze in particular a “huge relief”.  Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of pubs and brewing company Greene King, said the measures would “help provide vital respite’ to pubs struggling with high costs in other areas. However, he and others in the pub industry highlighted concerns about rising staff costs and the ongoing pain caused by inflation.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 4.44pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.26pm GMT \n Jeremy Hunt has handed “implausible plans to cut public spending” ( see earlier post  ) to the winner of the next election, says the Resolution Foundation.\nIn their rapid analysis of the autumn statement, Resolution say that pre-election giveaways have arrived early with the biggest tax cuts since 1988 (if you ignore Liz Truss’s proposals, which were largely abandoned).\nBut even so, tax as a share of GDP is still set to rise by 4.5 percentage points (or £4,300 per household) between 2019-20 and 2028-29, they calculate.\n Torsten Bell, chief executive at the Resolution Foundation,  said:\n“Today the chancellor used an inflation-driven surge in tax receipts to go early on pre-election giveaways – announcing the biggest package of tax cuts since 1988. In doing so, the chancellor has rightly prioritised workers’ earnings and firms’ investment plans. Raising the local housing allowance will also help 1.6 million households struggling with surging rents.\n“But the truth is taxes are up not down. Today’s cuts are dwarfed by tax rises already under way. By the end of this decade taxes are set to be up by the equivalent of £4,300 per household compared to 2019.\n“Worse, the giveaways announced today are funded by handing whoever wins the next election implausibly large spending cuts. Tax cuts to boost business investment are welcome, but undermined by plans to cut public investment by over a third – it’s hard to think of a more anti-growth policy.”\nenltr????

The growth outlook has weakened. Inflation is expected to stay higher for longer.\nHigher inflation pushes up tax receipts by more than it pushes up spending on debt interest or social security benefits; but rather than use the proceeds to ease the ongoing ‘fiscal drag’ effects of threshold freezes, or to compensate public services for higher costs, the chancellor opted to cut other taxes.\nHis immediate cut to national insurance will put more money into workers’ pockets when it comes in but won’t be enough to prevent this from being the biggest tax-raising parliament in modern times.\n Johnson then warns that announcing immediate and certain tax cuts in response to highly uncertain changes in assumptions about the UK’s medium-term economic prospects is “does not feel like a recipe for good management of the public finances”.\nHe says:\nHis [the chancellor’s] so called “headroom” against a rather loose fiscal target is minuscule and the OBR could easily take it away in the Spring Budget with some very small changes to forecasts. What will he do then?\nCertainly, whoever is Chancellor after the next general election is going to have very little room for manoeuvre.\nHaving said all that, Johnson concludes, Hunt has chosen a “pretty sensible set of taxes to cut”.\nMaking full expensing permanent rather than temporary is welcome.\nCutting rates of national insurance is preferable to cutting rates of income tax and may help boost employment. But these tax cuts have been ‘paid for’, in effect, by letting fiscal drag become even more of a tax rise than previously expected and through a bigger squeeze on the real-terms value of public service budgets and an even bigger squeeze on public investment, which is frozen in cash terms.\nThere’s a material risk that those plans prove undeliverable and today’s tax cuts will not prove to be sustainable.”\nenltrDespite some good news about growth this year, @OBR_uk  ’s forecast in the medium run is large downgrade on previous vintages.

In a statement, Ed Davey said the government was implementing a £200bn stealth tax raid and he said the amount people would gain from the national insurance cut announced today would not compensate for the extra tax they were paying because of allowances and thresholds being frozen. Davey said:\nThis autumn statement was a Hunt hoax. Buried in the small print is a massive stealth tax raid that will drag millions into paying a higher rate in the coming years.\nThe British people will rightly be furious at this deception, as they are forced to pay the price for Conservative chaos through years of unfair tax hikes.\nIt is high time that this Conservative government came clean about just how much money they are taking out of hard-working families’ pockets.\nThe Lib Dems says that, even after the national insurance cut announced today, someone earning £35,000 a year will still be paying an extra £400 in tax in 2024-25. And a higher rate taxpayer will still be paying an extra £1,200 a year, the Lib Dems says.\nTo justify calling it a £200bn stealth tax, the Lib Dems aren’t looking at the extra revenue raised annually (the standard methodology), but are instead adding together all the annual figures for stealth tax revenue in the chart published by the OBR.

Although gas prices have fallen faster than expected, stronger nominal wage growth means people have more money to spend.\nFrom a peak of 10.7% in the last quarter of last year, CPI inflation is now expected to fall to 4.8% in the final quarter of 2023.\n    A chart showing the latest inflation forecasts Photograph: OBR   \nThis higher inflation means that the financial markets expect interest rates to be around 1 percentage point higher than they did in March.\nThe OBR says:\nBank rate reached a 15-year high of 5.25% in August 2023, around 100 basis points above our previous forecast. And markets now expect bank rate to settle at 4% by the end of the forecast, rather than fall to 3% as we assumed in March.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.39pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 2.30pm GMT \n Frozen tax allowances will lead to almost 4m more people paying tax by 2028-29, OBR says  \nThe OBR report contains fresh figures on the impact of “fiscal drag”. It is well known that the government’s decision to freeze tax allowances and thresholds for six years means that large numbers of people are being brought into higher tax brackets, or into paying tax in the first place, but the latest figures are still quite striking.\nThe OBR says:\nBetween 2022-23 and 2028-29, this set of threshold freezes means nearly 4 million additional individuals will be expected to pay income tax, 3 million more will have moved to the higher rate, and 400,000 more onto the additional rate. This represents an increase in the number of taxpayers in each band of income tax – 11% for the basic rate band, 68% for the higher rate and 49% for the additional rate. Relative to our March forecast, this is a respective increase in 2027-28 of 830,000, 900,000, and 43,000.\nThe OBR also says that, by 2028-29, these policies will have raised an extra £44.6bn for the Treasury.\n    Impact of fiscal drag Photograph: OBR    \nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.41pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 2.23pm GMT \n Chancellor’s business rates measures are ‘smoke and mirrors’  \n Retailers and hospitality businesses were disappointed by the  chancellor’s plans to increase business rates for larger businesses, which will add almost £1.7bn to bills next year according to analysts. \nThere was relief that the rates discount of 75% for smaller hospitality, leisure and retail businesses operating in premises with a rateable value of less than £51,000 is to be extended by one year, benefiting about 1m businesses. A further 740,000 will continue to benefit from 100% small business rates relief.\nHowever, around 220,000 ratepayers will see their bills rise in line with September’s CPI figure of 6.7%, according to analysts at Gerald Eve, costing them £1.66bn next year and £8bn over the next five years.\nThe British Retail Consortium trade body described the business rates decision as a “disappointing announcement”.\n Kate Nicholls, the head of UK Hospitality, which represents thousands of pubs, restaurants and cafes, said many small businesses operated from larger standard rated premises and so would not benefit from the relief.\nenltrbusiness rates - hospitality rate relief extended for a further year at 75% and a freeze in small premises multiplier.

They are designed to win him plaudits for protecting businesses from rates increases whilst still raking in an extra £8bn in rates revenue.\n“Around 89% of all properties will indeed benefit from the freeze announced, but it is larger businesses – paying rates for some 220,000 properties – which pay over 75% of all rates next year, upon which this stealth tax will fall.”\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.31pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 2.20pm GMT \n Britain’s biggest green energy investors have enjoyed a share price bounce  after the  chancellor’s  autumn  statement, which has promised to accelerate £90bn in business investment over the next  10 years by making it easier to move ahead with multi billion-pound projects. \nShares in SSE, National Grid and the Copenhagen-listed Ørsted climbed as Jeremy Hunt set out plans to speed up planning consents, cut the wait for new grid connections and offer some of the most generous tax breaks of any developed economy for investors.\nThe companies, which are planning to make multibillion-pound investments in the UK’s green energy transition, are expected to benefit from the Treasury’s promise to make “full expensing” permanent in what Hunt described as “the largest business tax cut in modern British history”.\nShares in National Grid and SSE, which plans to invest £40bn in clean energy over the next 10 years, climbed to four-month highs after Hunt set out his plans. SSE’s share price climbed by almost 1% to 1,806p a share while National Grid’s share price climbed by nearly 0.5% to 1,043p a share.\nFor Denmark’s Ørsted the tax breaks could tip the balance in its decision on whether to move ahead with its £8bn plan to build the world’s biggest offshore windfarm off the Yorkshire coast.\nIts plan to develop the Hornsea 3 project was plunged into doubt due to a recent surge in offshore wind supply chain costs which led the company to cancel two major offshore wind projects off the US coast.  Ørsted is expected to make a final decision on the project before the end of the year.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.45pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 2.14pm GMT \n Unemployment is expected to rise by more than forecast at the March budget. \nThe Office for Budget Responsibility’s central forecast is that unemployment rises to 1.6 million people (4.6% of the labour force) and peaks in the second quarter of 2025.\nThat peak is 85,000 higher than expected in March – when it was expected to be 4.4% –and comes a year later than expected.\nThe OBR predicts that demand for labour will weaken, due to slower growth and the rise in interest rates.\nUnemployment then falls back to its assumed structural rate of 4.1% by the forecast horizon, as the bank rate falls and the spare capacity in the economy is taken up, the OBR adds.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.16pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 2.14pm GMT \nYou can read all the Treasury autumn statement documents on its website here.\nHere is the main autumn statement green book.

But departmental spending budgets are not inflation-linked, so did not automatically rise in response.\nThe OBR says:\nThe economy has proved more resilient to the shocks of the pandemic and energy crisis than we anticipated. But inflation has also been more persistent and interest rates higher than in March.\nHigher inflation boosts tax revenues but also welfare benefits while higher interest rates push up debt servicing. But because departmental spending is left largely unchanged, this delivers a net fiscal windfall of £27 billion.\nThe Chancellor spends virtually all of this on a 2p cut in NICs, permanent tax relief for business investment, and further welfare reforms, leaving debt falling by a narrow margin in five years.\nblock-time published-time 1.35pm GMT \n Reeves says 177 economies are expected to grow more quickly than the UK over the next few years.\nAnd next year the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth in the G7.\nThe UK is more world-following than world-beating.\nUnder Labour, the economy grew by 2% on average every year, she says.

This was the theory that people would not be willing to keep complying with Covid restrictions for a long period of time. Before lockdown was announced, Whitty cited this in public as one reason why restrictions should not be imposed too early. Whitty told the inquiry:\nThis is one where my communications were really poor, frankly, and I said in my statement, this is probably my most prominent, at least in my view, communications error.\nWhitty also said he was “told off” by his behavioural science colleagues for his phrasing and subsequently no longer spoke about the issue publicly.\nHe said “herd immunity” was never a policy goal at any point during the pandemic and the references to this by some officials in public were unhelpful.  He said:\nI don’t think I ever saw anybody on the record, or anybody sensible, aiming for it [herd immunity] as a goal. I think some people tried to explain it as ‘this is what would happen over time’, I think frankly, unhelpfully …\nIf we were to go back in terms of our communication errors along the way – and there were a lot – this is firmly one of the ones where I think we didn’t help the public by having a debate that I think, quite rightly, upset and confused a lot of people.\nHe also said the term meant different things to different people.\nSome people were meaning the herd immunity threshold – this is the point at which, for practical purposes, further waves are unlikely, which is very high.\nThe modellers were using it in the sense of a gradual increase – gradually increasing levels of immunity – meaning that the effective force of transmission gradually decreases but not to the point where there are no waves.\nAnd I think there was, muddled up between those two completely different uses of the term.\nHe described the anti-lockdown Great Barrington Declaration  as “flawed at multiple levels”.  This is from Peter Walker on X.\nChris Whitty on the Great Barrington Declaration: “I thought it was flawed at multiple levels”. It was implicitly based on the idea of lifelong post-infection immunity, he says, which turned out to be incorrect.\nenltrChris Whitty on the Great Barrington Declaration: ""I thought it was flawed at multiple levels”.

Peter reports:\nInquiry hears that Boris Johnson’s witness statement says ‘eat out to help out’ was “properly discussed” with health/science officials. Whitty says he and Vallance were not consulted: “I think we should have been.”\nblock-time published-time 11.19am GMT \nSpeculation about the autumn statement mostly focuses on the measures that Jeremy Hunt will announce, but budgets and autumn statements coincide with the Office for Budget Responsibility publishing its latest “economic and fiscal outlook” – a long report with forecasts that serve as a healthcheck on the state of the economy – and by the end of the day it is often the OBR that produces the most startling news lines.\nThe Financial Times says the OBR might have bad news for Rishi Sunak and Hunt on growth. In a preview  it says:\nThe measures [Hunt] announces are unlikely to forestall some unflattering growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog. While GDP growth is likely to be upgraded this year, the picture is less optimistic thereafter. In March the OBR said the UK economy would expand by 1.8% in 2024 and 2.5% in 2025. The Bank of England, by contrast, has predicted near-zero growth for both years.\nThe OBR’s 1.7% estimate of the UK’s sustainable growth rate, which is how fast the economy can grow without driving excess inflation, is also more optimistic than those of other forecasters. One of Hunt’s goals will be to convince the OBR to give him some economic credit for pro-business policies in its forecasts.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.33am GMT\nblock-time published-time 11.04am GMT \n Keir Starmer has said that a pause in hostilities between Israel and Hamas must be used to tackle the “urgent and unacceptable humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza.\nWelcoming the deal , which is expected to involve the release of 50 hostages being held by Hamas and a number of women and teenagers from Israeli jails, the Labour leader said his party had been calling for “a substantial humanitarian pause”. He said:\nThere must be immediate access to aid, food, water, fuel and medicine to ensure hospitals function and lives are saved. Aid and fuel need to not just get in but be distributed widely and safely.\nWe must also use the space this pause creates to take more steps on a path towards a full cessation of hostilities rather than an escalation of violence.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.07am GMT\nblock-time published-time 10.51am GMT \n     Jeremy Hunt on Downing Street with the autumn statement document this morning. Photograph: Reuters    \nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.50am GMT\nblock-time published-time 10.49am GMT \nIn his Guardian column today Rafael Behr argues the “headroom” being used by Jeremy Hunt to justify tax cuts (see 10.14am  ) is predicated on future spending cuts which the Conservatives, were they to win the next election, would never actually implement. He says it’s a trap for Labour. Here is an extract.\nThe real function of the projected spending squeeze is as a trap for Labour.  If the opposition rejects the Tory trajectory, it will be accused of planning a profligate spree with public money. And if it pledges adherence to impossible targets, it will enter government with its hands bound too tight to deliver prompt satisfaction to the people who voted for it.\nKeir Starmer and Rachel Reeves  have so far operated a sensible policy of not walking into traps of this kind. That approach restored swing voters’ trust in Labour as stewards of the economy. But it tests the patience of an activist base that sees reversal of austerity as a moral imperative and can smell the incipient disappointment in promises of fiscal discipline.\nThe immediate challenge for Labour after the autumn statement is to avoid getting ensnared in a game of saying whether it would accept or reverse various specific measures. This is a balancing act that involves rejecting the premise of the question without sounding too evasive; refusing to dance to a Tory tune when the whole event is choreographed by the government.\nAnd here is Rafael’s column in full.\n Related:  Hunt’s budget may be economic fantasy, but he’s set a political trap for Labour | Rafael Behr\nblock-time published-time 10.41am GMT \nAnd Jeremy Hunt will freeze alcohol duty in the autumn statement, the Sun has been told.\nblock-time published-time 10.36am GMT \nThe Financial Times has splashed this morning on a report  saying Jeremy Hunt will make the “full expensing” tax relief system for businesses permanent in the autumn statement. It says:\nThe scheme, which was due to expire in 2026, allows a company to immediately deduct all of its spending on IT equipment, plant or machinery from taxable profits. Extending it was a crucial demand of business groups. \nOfficials claimed Hunt’s permanent extension would give the UK one of the world’s most generous capital allowance regimes. One said the move would be the “biggest business tax cut in modern British history”. \nThe independent Office for Budget Responsibility in March said the temporary version of the £9bn-a-year full expensing policy would boost business investment by as much as 3 per cent a year during its initial three-year period.\nblock-time published-time 10.33am GMT \nHere is Phillip Inman ’s guide to what to expect in the autumn statement.\n Related:  What to expect in the autumn statement 2023\nblock-time published-time 10.14am GMT \n Harriet Baldwin, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Treasury committee, told GB News that she thinks Jeremy Hunt has “headroom” of around £20bn to use for tax cuts. She said:\nIf you look at the numbers that the Office for Budget Responsibility has been publishing each month, we think that there’s probably about £20bn of headroom and that’s because you and I, through those frozen tax levels and also businesses, we have actually ended up paying more tax this year than was planned in last year’s budget.\nSo I think that today gives the chancellor an opportunity to give some of that back to the hard-working businesses and people of this country so that we can grow the economy more rapidly next year.\nFor an alternative take on headroom, this is from the journalist James Ball. \nThe “headroom” you’re hearing about – the one to allow for tax cuts – is almost entirely fictional.

Today Jeremy Hunt will deliver his second autumn statement since (like his old boss David Cameron) he made a totally unexpected return to cabinet, appointed chancellor as Liz Truss’s premiership was in its death throes. After he delivered his first one just over a year ago, the Guardian’s report  led on Britain facing the biggest hit to living standards on record after Hunt announced £30bn of delayed spending cuts and £25bn of backdated tax increases. The Tory papers gave it probably the most negative coverage  for any fiscal statement from a Conservative chancellor in modern times. Almost anything today would get a better reception.\nBut in fact, if the advance briefing is reliable, Hunt is on course to deliver a statement that will get a dramatically better reception. As Larry Elliott and Pippa Crerar report in their preview, he will announce cuts to personal taxes, and a significant raft of pro-business measures.\n Related:  Autumn statement: Jeremy Hunt looks to cut UK taxes and ‘turbo-charge growth’\nHere are some of the front pages.\nenltrTELEGRAPH: Biggest tax cut for businesses in 50 years #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/ZfBrXGpK7A\n — Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) November 22, 2023\nenltrTHE TIMES: Hunt offers tax cuts for workers and businesses #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/VtZUCicNuD\n — Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) November 21, 2023\nenltrFT UK: Hunt to put £9bn a year tax break for business at core of growth drive #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/KoZcpbDYPR\n — Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) November 21, 2023\nRishi Sunak and Conservative MPs hope that this will be a turning point in his party’s fortunes. In a speech on Monday , he in effect announced his party’s election strategy, saying it would be a choice between “a Conservative party that is delivering lower taxes because we have now halved inflation and control spending, or a Labour party that’s just going to borrow an enormous amount more, not having learned the lessons at all of not just the last 10 years, but of the last two years, and continue with the same failed prescription, which is more government, more borrowing, more spending”.\nBut one autumn statement cannot undo the impact of decisions taken over one year, or four years, or 13 years. And, as Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation thinktank has pointed out, you should never talk about tax cuts without explaining the context.\nShort version: you’re not ‘cutting taxes’ if you raise people’s taxes a lot and then given them back a little\nenltrShort version: you're not 'cutting taxes' if you raise people's taxes a lot and then given them back a little https://t.co/XnaNsEVMET\n — Torsten Bell (@TorstenBell) November 21, 2023\nThis is a point Labour will be making. In a statement released overnight, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said:\nAfter 13 years of economic failure under the Conservatives, working people are worse off. Prices are still rising in the shops, energy bills are up and mortgage payments are higher after the Conservatives crashed the economy.\nThe 25 Tory tax rises since 2019 are the clearest sign of economic failure, with households paying £4,000 more in tax each year than they did in 2010. The Conservatives have become the party of high tax because they are the party of low growth. Nothing the chancellor says or does in his autumn statement can change their appalling record.\nUnder Keir Starmer’s leadership, the Labour party has changed. Labour is now the party of fiscal responsibility, we are the party of business and we are the only party with a plan to make working people better off.\nToday we will be focusing almost exclusively on the autumn statement. Graeme Wearden will be joining me on the blog later and we will be covering the statement in full, and providing reaction and analysis.\nHere is the agenda.\n8.30am: Rishi Sunak chairs cabinet, where Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, briefs colleagues on the autumn statement.\n12pm: Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs.\n12.30pm: Hunt presents his autumn statement to the Commons.\n2.30pm: Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, holds a press conference on the OBR’s forecasts.\nIf you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

So, we are upbeat about the concert today,” he said.\nPrime minister Anwar Ibrahim told the country’s parliament earlier this week: “Why should we stop a group that supports the Palestinian cause from performing?” He had been asked whether the concert was inappropriate during the conflict in Gaza.\nChris Martin recently told an audience in Japan: “We don’t believe in oppression, or occupation, terrorism or genocide … you can send [love and kindness] to Gaza and Israel, you can send it to the West Bank,” also naming Azerbaijan, Armenia, Ukraine, Russia, Iran, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2011, Coldplay promoted the charity single Freedom for Palestine on their Facebook page, and in 2019 collaborated with Palestinian band Le Trio Joubran on the song Arabesque, included on the album Everyday Life.\nConservative Muslims in Malaysia have opposed Coldplay’s concert due to the band’s support for the LGBTQ+ community. Ahmad Fadhli Shaari, information chief of Islamic party PAS, said in parliament: “This is not about whether they purely support the Palestinian cause or not but the issue of hedonism culture that they bring to our community.” In a post on social media in May, PAS called for the cancellation of the concert, saying the band encouraged “a culture of hedonism and perversion”, pairing the statement with a picture of Martin holding a rainbow flag.\nPolice forces and concert promoter Live Nation Malaysia have warned concertgoers not to behave provocatively, the latter asking them to be “mindful of local cultures and sensitivities”.\nLast week, conservative Muslim demonstrators clashed with police outside Gelora Bung Karno stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia, where Coldplay were performing. A banner reportedly read: “Reject, cancel and disband Coldplay concerts.” Indonesian politicians also opposed the concert, with Anwar Abbas of the Indonesian Ulema Council saying: “We know that Coldplay supports LGBT+, but now the question is, is the LGBT+ behaviour in line with … our constitution? There are six religions recognised in this country, and not one of them allows and tolerates LGBT+ practice.”\nBoth conservative Muslims and Malaysia’s LGBTQ+ community were critical of the kiss between the 1975’s Matty Healy and Ross MacDonald on stage in Kuala Lumpur in July. The entire Good Vibes festival was cut short following the swift cancellation of the 1975’s set, prompting the festival to began legal proceedings against the band.\nHealy remains unrepentant, telling a crowd at a Texas concert in October that the kiss was a longstanding part of their stage show: “To eliminate any routine part of the show in an effort to appease the Malaysian authorities’ bigoted views of LGBTQ people would be a passive endorsement of those politics. As liberals are so fond of saying, ‘Silence causes violence, use your platform’, so we did that … If you truly believe that artists have a responsibility to uphold their liberal virtues by using their massive platforms, then those artists should be judged by the danger and inconvenience that they face for doing so, not by the rewards they receive for parroting consensus.”\nColdplay, meanwhile, continue their Music of the Spheres tour , which began in March 2022 and aims to reduce carbon emissions by 50% compared with their previous world tour. Excluding the current east Asian leg, it has grossed $668m so far, and will continue into 2024 with 37 dates across Europe and Oceania. There is a conspicuous gap in their European tour schedule over the weekend of the 2024 Glastonbury festival, leading fans to hope for a fifth headline set there.\nEnd of Document\nPutin says Moscow ‘ready for talks’ to end ‘tragedy’ of war but blames Kyiv for lack of discussion – as it happened"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28

Sign up here","\nGood morning.\nIsrael and Hamas have agreed a deal for the release of 50 women and children held hostage in Gaza in return for 150 Palestinian women and children to be freed from Israeli jails during a four-day ceasefire, both sides announced this morning. \nThe deal was confirmed by a senior US official, who told reporters that the freed hostages would include three Americans, one of them a three-year-old girl. The official said the first hostage release is expected on Thursday morning, and the total number of hostages freed could rise.\nThe US president, Joe Biden, welcomed the deal and thanked Egypt and Qatar for their “critical leadership and partnership” in reaching the deal. He added: “And I appreciate the commitment that Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu and his government have made in supporting an extended pause to ensure this deal can be fully carried out and to ensure the provision of additional humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of innocent Palestinian families in Gaza … It is important that all aspects of this deal be fully implemented.”\n                                                                                        What has Israel said about the deal? A statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office said the “lull” in Israeli military operations would be extended for an additional day for every 10 more hostages released. It did not say when the ceasefire would start, though in his address to his cabinet, Netanyahu said the first hostages should be free within 48 hours of the agreement.                                                                                Sam Altman to return as CEO of OpenAI                                      \nSam Altman is to return as chief executive of OpenAI  after the ChatGPT developer said it had “reached an agreement in principle” for his reinstatement.\nThe San Francisco-based company made the announcement after days of corporate drama after Altman’s surprise sacking on Friday. Nearly all of OpenAI’s 750-strong workforce had threatened to quit unless the board overseeing the business brought back Altman and then quit immediately afterwards.\nAs part of the agreement reached overnight, the deal includes a new-look board led by Bret Taylor, the former co-CEO of the software firm Salesforce. It will include Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, and Adam D’Angelo, the tech entrepreneur and current board member who played a role in Altman’s firing.\n                                                                                        What did Altman say? He posted soon after: “I love OpenAI, and everything I’ve done over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together.” He added: “I’m looking forward to returning to OpenAI.”                                                                                Jill Stein formally launches 2024 White House bid as Green party candidate                                      \nA new front opened in the growing threats to Joe Biden’s presidency yesterday when the leftwing environmentalist Jill Stein formally launched her third presidential bid  in an online conversation with two fellow progressive activists.\nStein, 73, who is bidding to become the US Green party’s nominee, is the latest in a series of mostly leftist figures to announce candidacies with the potential to erode Biden’s core support in an expected rematch against Donald Trump in next year’s poll.\nHaving previously announced her candidacy with a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, she gave added substance to her campaign in a live Zoom conversation with Chris Smalls, a US trade union organiser for Amazon workers, and Miko Peled, an Israeli-born pro-Palestinian activist.\n                                                                                        Why does her entry into the race have special resonance? She had a supposedly decisive role in tipping battleground states to Trump in his 2016 presidential election victory over Hillary Clinton. While winning just 1.4m votes nationwide, Stein won more votes in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan than Trump’s narrow victory margins, prompting many analysts to conclude that her presence on the ballot was decisive in drawing progressive voters away from Clinton.

"Gaza ceasefire deal brings relief but little hope of durable peace","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 12:54:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:3",790," Jason Burke in Jerusalem"," Israeli military and intelligence services reported to have backed deal but are clearly committed to continuing efforts to ‘crush’ HamasIsrael-Hamas war – live updates","\nVery many people – in Israel, the occupied territories, the Middle East and well beyond – will feel immense relief at the news of a ceasefire and hostage deal. \nBut the provisional nature of the pause in the Israeli offensive into Gaza combined with the number of captives remaining with Hamas mean any hopes of a definitive end to hostilities remain tragically slender.\nThe consequences of the agreement are already rippling out across the region and beyond, but those most immediately affected will be the people of Gaza.\nSo far, between 13,000 and 14,000 Palestinians are thought to have been killed since Israel launched its offensive after the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 in southern Israel, mostly civilians in their homes or at a dance party.\nMuch of the north of Gaza has been made uninhabitable by the Israeli bombardment, and 1.7 million people displaced. All are now crammed into the south, which has been without adequate food, fuel, clean water, shelter and much else for almost seven weeks after Israel cut off supplies.\nAny cessation of hostilities and promises of increased aid will provide only very partial relief to the shattered, battered, grieving inhabitants of the the territory.\nOne UN official who has spent six weeks living in a compound near Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, with his family, told the Guardian on Wednesday: “I wish that once the ceasefire starts its opens the way for political solution, but it’s not clear yet …. It also it makes us think: what are we going to do when the war ends? Where to go when most of the people, and I am one of them, have lost their home? Where to live, when there is no infrastructure, no schools, no hospitals? It would take years just to remove the rubble.” \nThe deal will also provide only partial relief to the families of those 239 mainly Israeli hostages thought to be in Gaza. Even for families whose relatives are not immediately released, the deal offers hope. But for the families and friends of captured military personnel, possibly numbering about 100, there is the deeply distressing knowledge that these are the most valuable to Hamas and so will be the last to be freed. \nOfri Bibas Levy, whose brother, sister-in-law and two nephews – aged four and 10 months – are among the captives, said the deal puts families in an “inhumane” situation. Her brother, 34, is not expected to be among the first groups released.\n“Who will be released, who won’t? Will the kids be freed? Will they be freed with their mothers or not?” she said, shortly before the deal was announced. “No matter which way it happens, there will still be families that will remain worried and sad and angry.”\nThough far-right parties largely supported the deal, averting an immediate political crisis, many in Israel oppose the ceasefire. The Israeli military and intelligence services are reported to have backed the agreement with Hamas – despite the propaganda coup it hands their bitter enemy – but are clearly committed, like most of the public, to continuing the effort to “crush” Hamas.\nEven as the deal was being debated in Israel, an airstrike hit a residential building in the southern town of Khan Younis, killing 17 people, witnesses reported. An Associated Press reporter saw the bodies of two children pulled from the rubble, one badly burned.\nOn Wednesday morning, the apps that many Israelis use to warn of incoming rocket fire from Gaza also sounded.\nA military official told the Guardian last month that he and his colleagues had always known Israel would have to pay “a painful price” for the return of the hostages, but the heroic status that Hamas will win by forcing the release of young and female prisoners from Israeli jails is a bitter pill nonetheless.\nIsrael claims to have killed thousands of Hamas fighters, although it has not presented evidence, and destroyed parts of the group’s tunnel system. It also controls swaths of Hamas’s former strongholds in northern Gaza.\nBut it is clear that much of Hamas’s infrastructure is intact, and any pause will give the militants a chance to regroup. The Israeli military says 68 soldiers have been killed in ground operations – and the job of eliminating the threat from Hamas is incomplete.\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, promised ministers and coalition partners sceptical of the deal that the military offensive would continue “with full force” after the ceasefire ends in four or five days.\nYahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, has been described as a “dead man walking” by Israeli ministers but is still, apparently, sufficiently alive to give his final and deciding consent to the deal. The combination of Israeli rhetoric and Sinwar’s longevity does not make a durable peace appear likely soon.\nEnd of Document\nCeltic fined for fans’ Palestinian flags during Champions League game"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28
"West risks being complicit in Israeli war crimes, warn Arab and Muslim foreign ministers","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 13:42:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:4",912," Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor"," Delegation says west is allowing collective punishment of people of Gaza unless it demands Israel allow more aid into territory Israel-Hamas war – live updates","\nThe western powers on the UN security council face a choice of either demanding Israel lift its stranglehold on humanitarian aid into Gaza or being complicit in Israeli war crimes and collective punishment, foreign ministers from Arab and Muslim countries said on a visit to London on Wednesday.\nThe ministers are lobbying the five permanent members of the security council – China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US – to back a humanitarian resolution instructing Israel to allow UN agencies, and not the Israel Defense Forces, to check aid going through the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza. They say the proposal is in line with practice in Syria, and reflects their concern that Israel is determined to depopulate Gaza slowly by making it uninhabitable.\nThe call came as the head of Unicef, Catherine Russell, told the UN security council that the Gaza Strip was now “the most dangerous place on earth to be a child” , adding that four-day humanitarian pauses were not sufficient to “put a stop to this carnage”. A consortium of aid agencies also questioned what could be delivered to Gaza during the truce, due to start on Thursday.\nThe group of foreign ministers, from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Turkey, Nigeria and Palestine, were in London for talks with the foreign secretary, David Cameron, before seeing the French president, Emmanuel Macron, later on Wednesday. They had already been to Beijing and Moscow.\nAt a briefing in London they also called for the imminent humanitarian pause to be extended to a total and permanent cessation of hostilities.\nThe Saudi foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan al Saud, said: “It is absolutely necessary. It is in our opinion that we transition from temporary to an extended ceasefire and go from there.”\nPresenting the plan for the UN to take charge of the screening of aid entering Gaza – like the procedure that takes place at Syrian border crossings – Al Saud said: “We are putting a choice in front of members of the security council. Are they going to be complicit in the starvation and deprivation of the people of Gaza or are they willing to enforce the basic principle that civilians must not be affected by a military conflict?”\nHe asked: “Is the security council going to live up to its absolute minimum of responsibilities to ensure the innocent citizens of Gaza get the food, the water, the medical supplies that they need or are they willing to be part of collective punishment?”\nHe said if the west rejected the appeals of 2 billion people in the Middle East it would send a significant message. He added: “I don’t think the international community can afford to alienate the countries of the Arab and Muslim world.”\nThe Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said there was a huge gap between the 200 aid trucks a day to be allowed over the Rafah crossing under the agreement and the 800 a day needed.\nHe said it was imperative that aid was allowed to reach the north of Gaza where there has been no water or food supplied since 7 November, and hospitals and health centres are unable to function.\nThe ministers also conveyed a broader political message to western capitals that unless they do more to restrain Israel, a new generation of extremists could be born.\nThey remain convinced that Israel is planning to funnel the people of Gaza into a small, southern section of the territory, designate it a “safe zone” and then bomb the remainder of the Gaza until Palestinians plead to leave the strip.\nThe UN has said they are against safe zones in principle based on historic experience, but the US envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the UN security council that the US hoped Palestinians would move to safer areas.\nThe Egyptian foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, said: “The conditions are dismal, the displacement of people from north to south, the volume of people, the lack of shelter, sanitation, the risks of disease spreading … and aid cannot be delayed or there will be further displacement – that is the unspoken objective of Israel.”\nHe added that every western statement saying a displacement policy was not acceptable “has to be followed up by actual measures”. The aid agencies at a briefing said Israel was trying to force people in Gaza to go to the southern town of Al-Mawasi.\n“What are we as an international community doing to prevent displacement? If we continue on this road of restricting aid, there will be no recourse other than displacement,” he said.\nHe claimed: “In other conflicts the west has been categorical about what was happening so I do not see why in this instance there is a reluctance to call a spade a spade. There are a lot of statements saying the needs of international law must be respected, but not much evaluation of whether that need is being met or not.”\nAt briefings on Tuesday aid agencies said the four-day window to transport supplies into Gaza would only give them a chance to provide a drop in the ocean to 2 million people in need, but that they would concentrate on delivering medicines, food, water and tents.\nCameron told the Arab foreign ministers it was important that humanitarian organisations were able to transport more fuel into Gaza so they can carry out life-saving work – including powering hospitals or desalination plants, which supply 80% of Gaza’s water. The UK repeated its call, spurned by Israel, for priority to be given to improving land access, including by reopening the Kerem Shalom land crossing, so aid can be transported in at scale.\nEnd of Document\nOver 100 Palestinians reported killed in Gaza as attack continues despite ceasefire deal"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28

A further 60 were believed to be dead after bombing in and around the Jabaliya refugee camp in the north.\nRiyad al-Maliki, the Palestinian foreign minister, said during a visit to London that 52 of the victims at Jabaliya were from the same Qadoura family. “I have the list of the names, 52 of them. They were wiped out completely, from grandfather to grandchildren,” he said.\nDeadly bombing was also reported at al-Nuseirat refugee camp, killing nine people. Casualty figures are difficult to verify given the ongoing fighting, although initial reports often turn out to be underestimates until the missing are accounted for.\nThe ceasefire was due to begin on Thursday morning, but it was announced on Wednesday evening neither the truce nor the hostage release would happen before Friday. An initial 150 people are expected to be freed in the four days, in return for the release of 50 hostages  held by Hamas and other groups. But there was little sign of a slowdown in the fighting on Wednesday.\nFighting continued around two hospitals in the north of the Gaza Strip, the Indonesia hospital  and the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya, amid IDF demands that they be evacuated so that the military can take control.\nMedhat Abass, the director general of the health ministry in Gaza, said: “We fear for the lives of those inside Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and the Indonesian hospitals,” and earlier described the Indonesia hospital as “besieged”.\nAbass distributed a message from Dr Essay Nabhan, the head of the nursing department, who said: “The hospital was transformed from a centre providing medical services into a mass grave. There are corpses in all of the departments, and we lost many lives due to the lack of supplies.”\nSixty corpses lay in front of the morgue, they added. There were plans to bury them inside the grounds of the hospital, as it was unsafe to leave the premises where hundreds sheltered fearfully inside.\nAt the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya, the lone hospital in operation at the northern part of the enclave, the director, Ahmed al-Kahlout, told Al Jazeera that “shelling and bombardment are increasing everywhere in the vicinity of the hospital”.\nThe hospital had received more than 60 bodies with over 200 injured since last night, he added. “The medical teams are very tired. We don’t have a single drop of fuel. We work in the dark using handheld searchlights,” he said.\nIn another message distributed by the health ministry, Kahlout said the hospital was using cooking oil rather than diesel to run the hospital’s generators, and an ambulance targeting the wounded had been struck near the hospital grounds.\nIsrael declined to comment on the fighting around the hospitals. Instead an Israel Defense Forces officer confirmed the military would continue its attacks until the ceasefire took effect.\nLt Col Richard Hecht, the IDF’s international spokesperson, told a briefing at lunchtime: “We still have probably, maybe a day-plus before this thing matures, and things can happen in that day. And I assume today is going to be a day of fighting in Gaza.” \nIsrael’s troops pressed forward on the ground on Wednesday in an effort to gain control of as much territory as possible in northern Gaza before the halt in hostilities. Its forces encircled Jabaliya on Tuesday, where fighting was continuing, and on Wednesday called on residents of its old city and nearby Shuja’iya neighbourhood to evacuate south before 4pm.\nAttacks were coming from the sea as well as by air and land. The IDF released black and white footage showing bombing from air and sea, plus a video of Israeli soldiers operating in a shattered urban landscape, clearing buildings at gunpoint and calling in airstrikes to attack nearby compounds.\nThe IDF has described the ceasefire as an “operational pause”, in line with comments overnight from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu – a clear attempt to hint that bombing could resume after the hostage exchange is completed. “Our terminology is not ceasefire, our terminology is an operational pause,” Hecht said. \nGaza’s health ministry said it was able to evacuate 320 of the wounded and their families from the Indonesia hospital to southern Gaza on Wednesday using ambulances, while the remaining wounded were also evacuated from al-Shifa hospital.\nThe IDF showed a group of reporters a reinforced shaft linked to a bathroom, kitchen and an air-conditioned meeting room that it said was part of an underground network of Hamas tunnels beneath al-Shifa.\nThe tunnel shaft, about two metres (6.5ft) high, was accessed through an outdoor shaft in the hospital complex grounds.\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of using the hospital complex as a command and control base, an allegation denied by the militant group and hospital officials. The reporters were not taken inside the hospital and were allowed to see only a portion of the tunnel.\nAid agencies meanwhile warned that the humanitarian crisis was so catastrophic as a result of the fighting that a four-day pause in hostilities would do little to alleviate the situation, and called for a permanent ceasefire.\nJoël Weiler, executive director of the medical charity Médecins du Monde, said: “For a medical organisation, four days of pause is … Band-Aid, not healthcare.” Others warned that there were limitations on the amount of aid that could cross the border and the volume of fuel being made available as long as no extra crossing points were being opened beyond the existing Rafah facility on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt.\nEnd of Document\nIsrael-Hamas war opens up German debate over meaning of ‘Never again’"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28
"Netanyahu avoids political rebellion over Hamas hostage deal but ally calls it ‘immoral’","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 15:37:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:2",914," Peter Beaumont"," Israel’s PM facing pressure from all sides as some say ceasefire agreement does not go far enoughIsrael-Hamas war – live updates","\nIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has managed to avert a wider rebellion over the Gaza deal with Hamas among his far-right coalition partners even as Itamar Ben-Gvir, the firebrand national security minister, called it immoral.\nThree ministers, all from Ben-Gvir’s far-right Jewish Power party, oppose the deal but members of the equally hardline Religious Zionist party were persuaded to support it after heated exchanges in an Israeli cabinet meeting late on Tuesday night.\nThe agreement reached with Hamas will mean 50 women and children who are being held as hostages  in Gaza will be released in an exchange for a four-day ceasefire and the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners in Israel, with the possibility of more releases from each side for each further day there is no fighting.\nThe deal was made after weeks in which Netanyahu had been vocal in his opposition to any pause in Israel’s military offensive against Hamas in Gaza, but there has also been mounting political pressure on the prime minister, who has seen his support among voters collapse since the 7 October massacre by Hamas.\nAmid warning signs of political difficulties for Netanyhu, who depends on support from far-right parties to remain in power, Ben-Gvir heavily criticised the deal on Wednesday. “We don’t have the right to agree to separating them and only some of them returning,” he said. “And we definitely cannot accept an outline that sees the release of female and underage terrorists when we don’t get back everyone”, adding that the ceasefire benefited Hamas.\nLeaks from the cabinet meeting suggested that Ben-Gvir had also said that the decision to back the deal threatened “generational damage that will come back to hurt us badly”.\nThe support from Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, and his Religious Zionist party, however, represented a victory for Netanyahu and his senior allies.\nSupport for the deal appears to have been clinched with the decision by Yoav Gallant, the defence minister, and by senior officials in the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency to back it, even if it meant slowing the pace of the offensive.\n“The Religious Zionist party’s ministers were convinced that this is an achievement that matches and advances the aims of the war and won’t harm them,” the party said in a statement after the vote. “It’s a deal with low prices which is a result of the pressure placed on [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar, a deal that will release many women and children, and a move that is limited in time and includes clear mechanisms that will prevent erosion. Immediately afterward, the war will continue until Hamas is destroyed.”\nTalks around the truce in exchange for the release of hostages have seen Netayahu and his cabinet attempt to balance two competing concerns.\nOn one hand, support for an arrangement to release those held captive by Hamas and other armed Palestinian factions in Gaza enjoys widespread public support, much of which has been galvanised by the campaign waged by the families of the hostages.\nOn the other hand, however, has been the concern that an agreement for a substantial ceasefire could mark the beginning of the end of Israel’s war against Hamas, a concern dismissed by Netanyahu as “nonsense”.\nJustifying his support for a deal he had previously rejected, Netanyahu said: “Let me make clear: we are at war, and we will continue the war until we achieve all our objectives – eradicating Hamas, bringing back all our hostages and MIAs, and guaranteeing that there will be no figure in Gaza that threatens Israel.”\nIsaac Herzog, Israel’s president, however, acknowledged that the deal – while moral – would inspire “understandable, painful and difficult misgivings”.\n“It is a moral and ethical duty that correctly expresses the Jewish and Israeli value of redeeming captives, and I hope that it will be a significant first step for bringing all the captives home,” he said.\nReactions among leading Israeli columnists on Wednesday reflected the continuing political problems that Netanyahu is facing even as he tries to sell the deal, with Nahum Barnea, a journalist for the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, suggesting that “Israel has no choice but to pay the price” while linking the agreement with the failures of 7 October.\n“The alternative to forsaking the hostages a second time, after they were first forsaken on October, would have been far worse and far more dangerous. Beyond the price it could end up costing in blood and lives, it would have left an indelible stain on the Israeli government and the IDF.”\nOthers were more damning still. Also writing in Yedioth, Yossi Yehoshua warned that Israel risked missing “an historic opportunity to fundamentally change the Gaza problem, and will not only pay for that in soldiers’ lives but by missing out on a better deal”, adding “we are jeopardising our most important war in recent decades. One man has to own all of this: Binyamin Netanyahu.”\nOn Kan Radio, Gadi Shamni, a former senior military officer, said: “I’m not sure that Netanyahu wants to win this war. This floundering might work for him.\n“Netanyahu already realises that he is going to be remembered in infamy as the man who with his own two hands moulded this crisis. The prime minister delayed the IDF [ground] manoeuvre for weeks – he didn’t believe in the IDF’s capabilities, and he chose to waste his time.\n“What Netanyahu wants, first of all, first and foremost, is to minimise the damage to himself,” he said.\nEnd of Document\nJill Stein formally launches 2024 White House bid as Green party candidate"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28

The families said they were in the dark about who would be released and when.\nKeren Schem said she feared the deal might collapse but she was praying for the release of her daughter, Mia Schem, 21, who was abducted from the Supernova music festival. “It’s like Russian roulette. We don’t know who’s going to come out,” Keren Schem, 51, said. “They’re talking about children and their mothers so I don’t think that Mia will come out today or tomorrow or even the day after. But I’m praying that she will because nobody really knows.”\nMia, a French-Israeli tattoo artist, appeared to be injured in a hostage video released by Hamas on 17 October. Her mother said her daughter needed to be released urgently so she could receive medical treatment. “I don’t know where she is, if she’s alive, and in what condition she’s in, if she eats, if she sleeps, if they’re hurting her. It’s so terrible,” she said.\nEylon Keshet said he was afraid that his cousin, Yarden Bibas, 34, would be split from his wife, Shiri, 32 and their two boys, Ariel, four, and 10-month-old Kfir, who is thought to be the youngest hostage.\n“I’m afraid that this is what it means, but, unfortunately, I’m not optimistic from the very beginning that Yarden was held together with them because he was kidnapped separately from them and I don’t think Hamas cares much to reunite families,” Keshet said.\nFootage of Shiri clutching her two red-haired children as she was abducted was posted online. Yarden appeared in a separate video with an apparent head injury. “We still don’t know whether Shiri, Ariel and Kfir will be a part of this deal. And we still don’t have information about their wellbeing, so we can’t feel relieved until they’ve actually made it back here,” Keshet said.\nItay Raviv, three generations of whose family are being held hostage, said he was wrestling with “a mixture of feelings”. His aunt and uncle, Ruti and Avraham Munder, both 78, were abducted from the Nir Oz kibbutz along with their daughter Keren and her son Ohad, who turned nine in captivity. Keren’s brother, Roee Munder, 50, was among the 1,200 people killed after Hamas stormed southern Israel on 7 October.\n“We’re in an ongoing nightmare,” Raviv said. “We feel both excited, but still very nervous and scared because nothing is promised and we don’t know who is going to be released, if any, because we cannot trust Hamas. We must remember that, according to what is being reported, it’s only going to be women and children, and I have some other family members, my uncle and aunt, in Hamas’s hands as well.”\nHe said the family had not been told if any of the four captives would be released and that it was “all assumptions at the moment”.\nRaviv, 27, the CEO of a non-profit organisation, said the family was preparing for a memorial service for Roee on Wednesday afternoon, as they waited for news about the hostages. “We’re going there without his parents, without his sister, without his nephew, and this is the same way the funeral was, which is just another sad thing that happens in our reality,” he said. Sharone Lifschitz, whose 85-year-old mother, Yocheved Lifshitz, was released by Hamas after 16 days in captivity, said it was “devastating” that her father, Oded, 83, who is still being held hostage, would unlikely to be among those released in the first stages of the deal.\nThe first hostage release is now not expected until Friday at the earliest, and the total number of those freed could rise. The Israeli government said the ceasefire would be extended by a day for every 10 additional hostages released, but it is unclear who that would include.\n“We are very anxious in terms of going forward. When will it be our turn? It’s just really hard to survive emotionally. It’s the most horrific extension of a position that was impossible to begin with,” Lifschitz said. “We are in the hands of a terrorist organisation that is doing everything to maximise our pain and the suffering.”\nLifschitz, a London-based artist and academic, said she believed her father, a veteran journalist and peace activist from Nir Oz, would think it was right that children were being released before him. “If there is a queue for the way out, he and quite a few other members will be fighting to be at the end of the queue and give their place ahead. That’s what I feel,” she said.\nShe said her mother was also in agreement. “She thinks very similar to me, that we have to return the children, that there is nothing else to it.”\nThe British niece of Ditza Heiman, 84, a retired social worker and widow taken from Nir Oz, said they were “desperate for good news”. The last time anyone heard from the mother of four was at about 4pm on 7 October when a Hamas fighter answered her phone.\nHer niece, who did not want to be named, said: “It’s agonising. She’s 84 so she could be eligible for this deal but we don’t know, none of the loved ones do. Every family’s suffering that can be reduced is a good thing, but we don’t know whether it will be us.”\nEnd of Document\nRights groups condemn ‘police repression’ at ‘peaceful’ pro-Palestine rally in Sydney"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28
"The principle of human dignity must apply to all people","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 16:00:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",705,""," Adam Tooze, Samuel Moyn, Amia Srinivasan and others respond to a statement issued by German academics on the situation in Israel and Gaza. Report:Israel-Hamas war opens up German debate over meaning of ‘Never again’","\nWe the undersigned are deeply concerned by the statement  “Principles of solidarity” published on the website of the Normative Orders research centre at Goethe-Universität Frankfurt on 13 November 2023, signed by Nicole Deitelhoff, Rainer Forst, Klaus Günther and Jürgen Habermas.\nWe join the authors in condemning the killing and taking hostage of Israeli civilians by Hamas on 7 October 2023 and we fully agree with the vital need to protect Jewish life in Germany in the face of rising antisemitism. We also agree with the statement’s grounding of these positions in the respect for human dignity for all people as a central part of the “democratic ethos of the Federal Republic of Germany”.\nHowever, we are deeply troubled by the apparent limits of the solidarity expressed by the authors. The statement’s concern for human dignity is not adequately extended to Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are facing death and destruction. Nor is it applied or extended to Muslims in Germany experiencing rising Islamophobia. Solidarity means that the principle of human dignity must apply to all people. This requires us to recognise and address the suffering of all those affected by an armed conflict.\nThe statement claims that “the standards of judgement slip completely when genocidal intentions are attributed to Israel’s actions”. There is ongoing discussion  among genocide scholars  and legal experts about whether the legal standard for genocide has been met. Human rights groups have filed lawsuits alleging genocide at the international criminal court  and a federal court  in the US. Omer Bartov , professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University, has recently reminded us: “We know from history that it is crucial to warn of the potential for genocide before it occurs, rather than belatedly condemn it after it has taken place. I think we still have that time.” Showing solidarity and respecting human dignity means that we must heed this warning and not close down the space for debate and reflection about the possibility of genocide. Not all signatories believe that the legal standards for genocide have been met; nevertheless, all agree that this is a matter of legitimate debate.\nThe statement mentions three “guiding principles” for military action: “principles of proportionality, the prevention of civilian casualties and the waging of a war with the prospect for future peace”. We are concerned that there is no mention of upholding international law, which also prohibits war crimes and crimes against humanity such as collective punishment, persecution, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure including schools, hospitals and places of worship. Being guided by principles of international legal standards, solidarity and human dignity compels us to hold all participants in the conflict to this higher standard.\nWe cannot allow the atrocities to force us to abandon these principles.\n                     Adam Tooze                     Professor of history, Columbia University                                          Samuel Moyn                     Professor of law and history, Yale University                      Amia Srinivasan                     Professor of social and political theory, University of Oxford                      Nancy Fraser                     Professor of political and social science, New School for Social Research                      Alice Crary                     Professor of philosophy, New School for Social Research                      Linda Zerilli                     Charles E Merriam distinguished service professor of political science, University of Chicago                      Chandra Talpade Mohanty                     Distinguished professor, Syracuse University                      Diedrich Diederichsen                     Professor for theory of contemporary art, Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna                      Beate Roessler                     Professor of philosophy, University of Amsterdam                      Quinn Slobodian                     Professor of history, Wellesley College                      Cécile Malaspina                     Director of programme, Collège international de philosophie, France                   \nEnd of Document\nAfternoon Update: Israel and Hamas agree to four-day ceasefire; ABC settles Bruce Lehrmann defamation case; and US Catholic priest marries teen"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28

But the war between Israel and Hamas has opened up a fiercely fought debate about the phrase’s true meaning, dividing opinion among followers of the dominant German intellectual tradition.\nA letter published  in the Guardian pits several prominent German and international figures influenced by the Frankfurt School of neo-Marxist “critical theory” against its most prominent living member, Jürgen Habermas. They argue that “Never again” must also mean staying alert to the possibility that what is unfolding in Gaza could amount to genocide.\nIn a statement published on 13 November, Habermas made the case that the “Never again” principle must above all lead to a German commitment to protecting Jewish life and Israel’s right to exist.\nHabermas, 94, sometimes described as a contemporary successor to the Enlightenment philosophers for his writing on themes of power and justice, argued that Israel’s military retaliation following the 7 October Hamas attacks was “justified in principle”. Likening the resulting bloodshed in Gaza to a genocide was beyond the boundaries of acceptable debate, he said.\n“Despite all the concern for the fate of the Palestinian population […], the standards of judgment slip completely when genocidal intentions are attributed to Israel’s actions,” said the statement, which was also signed by the political scientist Rainer Forst, the lawyer Klaus Günther and the peace researcher Nicole Deitelhoff.\nIn response, the letter published on Wednesday echoes Habermas’s condemnation of the Hamas attack and hostage-taking, but expresses concern over the “apparent limits of the solidarity expressed” by the philosopher and his co-authors.\n“The statement’s concern for human dignity is not adequately extended to Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are facing death and destruction,” it adds. “Nor is it applied or extended to Muslims in Germany experiencing rising Islamophobia. Solidarity means that the principle of human dignity must apply to all people. This requires us to recognise and address the suffering of all those affected by an armed conflict.”\nThe letter continues: “We are concerned that there is no mention of upholding international law, which also prohibits war crimes and crimes against humanity such as collective punishment, persecution, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure including schools, hospitals and places of worship.”\nWhile “not all signatories believe that the legal standards for genocide have been met” by the situation in Gaza, the letter says, all of them “agree this is a matter of legitimate debate”.\nOn Sunday, a group of UN experts said there was “evidence of increasing genocidal incitement” against the Palestinian people. Israeli officials reject this.\nThe letter’s full list of more than 100 supporters  includes several academics who have either directly emerged from the Frankfurt School or are employed at New York’s New School for Social Research, which sees itself working within the same critical theory tradition.\nOther signatories include the economist Adam Tooze, the legal historian Samuel Moyn, and the philosophers Amia Srinivasan and Nancy Fraser.\nMore than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas militants on 7 October. Since Israel’s counter-offensive was launched , more than 14,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Hamas-run health authorities.\nOn Wednesday , Israel and Hamas agreed a deal for the release of 50 women and children hostages held in Gaza in return for 150 Palestinian women and children to be freed from Israeli jails during a four-day ceasefire.\nFounded in 1923, the Frankfurt School applied Marxist theory to philosophy and social theory to make sense of the rise of fascism out of apparently liberal European societies. Habermas, a former assistant to Theodor Adorno, took a more optimistic stance than the institution’s founding members, seeking to build an intellectual framework for democratic societies operating within market capitalism.\nHabermas’s letter reflects a strong, cross-party pro-Israel consensus in German politics. The to-and-fro of statements comes on the back of a motion for a resolution  put forward on 7 November by the three centre-left and liberal parties of Olaf Scholz’s coalition government, which proposes allowing the extradition of non-German citizenship holders who spread hatred against Jews, as well as withdrawing funding from cultural institutions that support the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement.\nCritics fear such a resolution would also result in the silencing of legitimate criticism of Israeli policies. In Berlin, the city senate is considering pulling funding for the Oyoun cultural centre in the German capital’s Neukölln district, after the centre’s directors reportedly refused to cancel a peace vigil by a leftwing Jewish group.\nEnd of Document\nNetanyahu avoids political rebellion over Hamas hostage deal but ally calls it ‘immoral’"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28
"The Gaza truce is a ray of hope in the darkness. Both sides must remember that","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 16:40:00," OPINION; Version:2",942," Martin Kettle"," The deal divided the Israeli cabinet, and likely Hamas too – for now it suits their interests, but this is a very fragile pause","\nObserving events from outside the region, one habitually hesitates. Nevertheless, it feels clear that the four-day truce  between Hamas and Israel, with the exchange of prisoners that is woven into it, is better than what preceded it.\nIt will bring home some abducted Israelis and will save some Palestinian lives, though not enough in either case. It involves the kind of political concessions without which conflict becomes endless. It is a cheering success for the diplomacy that brokered it. It brings a pause. And it is a precedent.\nAll this is so obviously true that the people of the region, and most of the world’s governments, will inevitably breathe a collective sigh of relief if Thursday’s 10am start to the truce, now delayed by at least 24 hours, passes off smoothly. But it feels equally clear that the significance and durability of the truce should not be overstated. Its terms are extremely contingent. All sorts of things could go wrong, hour by hour, handover by handover, and become pretexts for renewed brutality.\nThe truce’s elaborately choreographed conditionality makes it an accident waiting to happen. Hopefully, those who negotiated it have put contingency plans in place to stop a glitch from spiralling into a breakdown. But the truce will not end the agonies of some of those who are suffering most. Nor will it allay the suspicions of those on both sides who oppose it. The deal offers no guarantees at all for the future. And Israel and Hamas have explicitly pledged to resume the conflict.\nEven so, a truce offers hope. Many will naturally clutch at that. But the limitations should not be shirked. The deal divided the Israeli cabinet. It will probably divide Hamas, too. Those who oppose it will seek to undermine it, perhaps by lethal means. The longer the hostage release process is dragged out, the tougher it will become to complete it. If the process gets that far, its final days will be even more tense than these first days already are.\nConsider, if nothing else, the emotional suffering written into the evolution of this deal, even if all goes to plan. The first releases  will reportedly be of 10 Israeli women and children, and of 30 Palestinian detainees. The joy and tears of the hostages and their relatives will be beamed around the world. A similar set of exchanges is expected to be repeated over the following days. Yet, for every family that rejoices, there will be many more who cannot do so, families for whom the wait will daily get longer, the stress of uncertainty greater. If these releases continue, as the Americans say is incentivised by the deal, the process  will become a game of Russian roulette with their lives.\nThat is not a reason not to try. Far from it. But it underscores the vulnerability of the process. Right now, both sides undoubtedly have incentives to pause the fighting. Israel wants its people back, and prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has bowed to pressure from hostages’ families and from his security chiefs to pick up a deal that he rejected in the past. Hamas presumably wants to regroup, to re-equip and to redeploy after the battering of Gaza.\nBut do they both want the process to continue for long? The reality is that both also have incentives to restart fighting. Hamas because, after years in which the world turned away from it and in which oil-rich Arab states began making peace with Israel, the organisation’s vicious assaults have made the world pay attention to Palestine once more. Israel because Netanyahu knows that, after his failures helped pave the way for the horror of 7 October, he faces being ousted  from office and prosecuted for corruption as soon as the conflict comes to an end.\nI make no claim to military expertise, but it seems more likely than not that the war will in fact restart. Even before the 7 October attack , Israel and Hamas had been fighting a prolonged low-intensity conflict for years. Nearly seven weeks later, neither has got close to their ostensible war aims of destroying the other altogether. Israel has pulverised Gaza, but it has not yet shown the world that it has found, destroyed or expelled Hamas’s military nucleus. Hamas has committed an unconscionable massacre, but it has conspicuously failed to rouse the rest of the region to its banner.\nIf war is the extension of politics by other means, then today’s mutual military failure reflects a mutual political failure, too. The 30-year refusal of both sides to cooperate to deliver a two-state solution is as reprehensible as its now monumentally dire consequences, which include the Israeli settlements and the sleazy enfeeblement of Palestinian politics. These consequences are now so deeply rooted that it seems no amount of ingenious heavyweight diplomacy could really overcome them.\nYet this is the question that the truce at least places on the table. Whether it can be answered better than in the past depends on three huge and highly uncertain things: the ability of Joe Biden’s United States to drive a comprehensive deal before a presidential election that Donald Trump (whom Netanyahu supports) may win; the availability of Gulf money to bankroll and buttress the reconstruction of a new Palestinian state; and the readiness of Israelis and Palestinians to decide to do the very opposite of what Netanyahu and Hamas want.

"Benjamin Netanyahu warns war will continue until Hamas is eliminated","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 16:42:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:7",1414," Jason Burke in Jerusalem"," Israeli PM says conflict is not over after negotiation of four-day truce to release hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisonersIsrael-Hamas war – live updates","\nBenjamin Netanyahu has warned that the war against Hamas will continue, despite a brief ceasefire set to start this week and the expected release of some of the hostages held in Gaza by the militant Islamist organisation.\n“The war continues,” said the Israeli prime minister at a press conference in Tel Aviv.\n“We continue until we have achieved complete victory … Eliminating Hamas , liberating our captives and making sure that post-Hamas there will be no threat to Israel.”\nNetanyahu’s national security adviser said the release of dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel had been delayed until Friday.\nIn a statement released late on Wednesday, Tzachi Hanegbi said that talks on the deal were continuing. “The release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday,” he said.\nThe swap is to take place as part of the first ceasefire in seven weeks of war in Gaza, which is also due to come into effect on Friday and will last for a minimum of four days, officials from both Hamas and Israel have said.\nThe truce was announced early on Wednesday  after days of speculation. More than 100 Palestinians were reported killed within hours as Israeli forces continued attacking Gaza from land, sea and air.\nUnder the agreement, Hamas will free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages  they took on 7 October. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.\nThere will be a halt to Israeli air sorties over southern Gaza, with air activity over northern Gaza restricted to six hours a day. According to a Hamas statement, Israel has agreed not to arrest anyone in Gaza for the duration of the truce.\nThe logistics of arranging the complex exchange of prisoners and hostages while enforcing a pause in fighting could still mean delays. \nThe hostages to be freed are women and children, and the Palestinian prisoners are also women and people aged 18 and younger, both sides have confirmed.\nIf the first exchanges go well, and Hamas can locate more female hostages or children, there will be further releases on both sides, reports suggest.\nThe deal, struck after lengthy and complex talks mediated by Qatar , the US and Egypt, comes more than six weeks after the conflict began on 7 October, when Hamas launched attacks from Gaza into southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 240 people hostage.\nThe Israeli offensive has killed between 13,000 and 14,000 people, thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials. More are thought to be under rubble. Swaths of northern Gaza have been destroyed in the fighting, and up to a million people displaced.\nThough the deal has raised hopes of a more durable cessation of hostilities Netanyahu has vowed to “complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the state of Israel from Gaza”. “We are at war, and we will continue the war,” he said. “We will continue until we achieve all our goals.”\nThe Israeli government approved the deal only after a sometimes acrimonious marathon overnight debate. Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister, emphasised that “immediately after we have exhausted this phase”, military operations would “continue in full force”.\nIsraeli officials may be encouraged by the decision of Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based Islamist militia and political movement, to observe the truce, despite not having been involved in negotiations. Violence has increased along Israel’s northern frontier, with a series of tit-for-tat exchanges of fire.\nThe Israeli cabinet’s signoff was one of the last hurdles after what one US official described as five “extremely excruciating” weeks of talks.\nOne stumbling block was obtaining the consent of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza, whose views have often diverged from those of Hamas leaders outside the territory.  This was “late coming”, analysts said. An official of the Islamist group said that “the resistance is committed to the truce as long as the occupation honours it”.\nIf the initial phase of the deal works, 150 more Palestinian prisoners could be released in a subsequent phase in exchange for 50 more hostages, according to an Israeli government document that named 300 eligible prisoners. For every 10 additional hostages released, there would be an extra day’s “pause” in fighting, the document said.\nIsrael’s Hostages and Missing Families Forum welcomed the deal. “We are very happy that a partial release is pending … but as of now, we don’t know exactly who will be released when,” the group said.\nThe lack of clarity over exactly who was to be freed caused distress on both sides.\n“We don’t know who will get out because Hamas will release the names every evening of those who will get out the next day,” said Gilad Korngold, whose son and daughter-in-law are being held in Gaza along with their two children and other relatives.\nIsrael’s list of eligible Palestinian prisoners included 33 women and 123 young people, most of whom have been charged with public order offences or arson. No prisoners convicted of murder will be freed, local media reported, but two serving long sentences for stabbing an Israeli officer are on the list.\nAmani Sarahneh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club advocacy group, said: “We don’t know who will be freed first, and that’s a problem for us in responding to the families.”\nAmong the Palestinians who could be released is Shorouq Dwayyat, who was convicted of attempted murder in a 2015 knife attack.  Her mother, Sameera Dwayyat, said she hoped her daughter would come out as part of a deal, but added that her relief was tempered by “great pain in my heart” over the dead children in Gaza.\nA senior US official said three American hostages, including three-year-old Abigail Mor Idan , were among 50 people earmarked for release from Thursday. \nEven if fully implemented, the current agreement would still leave about 190 hostages in Gaza, about half of whom are thought to be military personnel.\nThe truce deal was welcomed by countries including Britain, China, France, Germany, Jordan and Egypt. \nNot all the hostages are being held by Hamas. Some are in the hands of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a separate extremist faction, and criminals in Gaza, say Israeli and other officials.\nAlmost half of the hostages have dual nationality, hailing from Argentina, Germany, America, France, Thailand, Nepal and Russia. \nThe deal is a significant propaganda coup for Hamas and a personal victory for Sinwar, who spent 23 years in Israeli prisons before being released in an exchange in 2011. He tops Israel’s hitlist and his whereabouts are unknown.\nMeeting the terms of the deal will require Hamas to ensure that all 50 hostages reach the borders of Gaza safely, a logistical challenge. The group indicated during negotiations that it did not know the exact location of every hostage because they were held by disparate groups.\nNetanyahu will now be under domestic pressure to secure the release of the rest of the hostages, but faces growing political risks. Several far-right parties that are part of the ruling coalition on Tuesday evening opposed the proposed deal and called for the Israeli offensive in Gaza to be intensified to secure better terms. Their statements prompted protests in Tel Aviv by hostages’ families. If Israel does resume its offensive, its military is likely to attempt to advance into southern Gaza. It is not clear what would happen to the more than 2 million civilians sheltering there. Senior US officials have suggested they would not support any such offensive without a credible plan to protect that population.\nJosep Borrell, the EU’s head of foreign affairs, said the Israeli military had told him they planned to create a “small safe area along the sea in the southern part of Gaza” for the civilian population “in order to carry out the ground operations in the south”.\nIsraeli military officials have suggested the plan in recent days, prompting deep concern even among staunch allies. “This did not reassure me about the future course of events if we fail to achieve a rapid and durable de-escalation of the military operations,” Borrell wrote.\n                     Additional reporting by Lisa O’Carroll in Brussels                   \nEnd of Document\nIsrael-Hamas war live: no hostages to be released before Friday, says Israeli official, amid reports ceasefire also delayed"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28

It wasn’t enough. It wasn’t enough.”\nWhen the vendor says he doesn’t speak English, Seldowitz laughs and says, “That’s why you’re selling food in a food cart, because you’re ignorant,” before suggesting that the vendor will be deported to Egypt and tortured by intelligence agents.\n“The mukhabarat in Egypt will get your parents,” Seldowitz said in the video. “Does your father like his fingernails? They will take them out one by one.”\nThe vendor is heard asking Seldowitz to “please go” and saying that he would call the police.\nAn NYPD spokesperson told the outlet that they are aware of the videos and monitoring the situation but that no reports had been filed. The woman who posted the videos , who is believed to be a social activist and Columbia University graduate, said Seldowitz had been harassing the vendor for weeks.\nSeldowitz was identified by  the City & State publication, and later said that he’d had “an argument with a food vendor”, adding: “It is quite possible that it’s me. I mean, I’ve not seen the video, but I believe it’s probably me.”\nThe lobbying firm where Seldowitz was a consultant said it has cut ties with him, stating: “The video of his actions is vile racist, and beneath the dignity of the standards we practice at our firm.”\n“I’m absolutely outraged by this video,” the founder and president of Gotham Government Relations, David Schwartz, told the outlet, adding: “I’ll represent the food vendor pro bono if he wants to bring a lawsuit.”\nAnother firm connected to Seldowitz, according to his LinkedIn profile, Northwestern Mutual, denied  that the man caught in the videos was an employee or affiliated with it.\nSeldowitz told City & State he was “blindsided” by being fired by the lobbying firm and said he had not worked with Gotham “for a very long time”.\nHe said he often passed the vendor and claimed he wanted to engage him in a discussion about current events. “I regret the whole thing happened and I’m sorry,” he said. “But you know, in the heat of the moment, I said things that probably I shouldn’t have said.”\nThe vendor told the Daily Mail, giving his name as Mohammad and his age as 24, that he did nothing to provoke Seldowitz, who he said started asking him two weeks ago where he was from and harassing him about the war between Hamas and Israel. His boss, Islam Mustafa, translating for him, said Mohammad felt “hurt”.\n“He’s scared. He is just a worker. Now he’s fighting someone with connections and a lot of power,” Mustafa said.\nEnd of Document\nCorrections and clarifications"," November 22, 2023",2023-11-28
"300 Palestinian women and children in Israeli jails listed before hostage swap","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 17:13:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:6",762," Bethan McKernan in Jerusalem"," An initial 10 Gaza hostages expected to be released, followed by 50 Palestinians, according to source","\nPalestinian and Israeli officials have published the names of 300 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons, at least some of whom are expected to be released in an exchange with Hamas in Gaza for dozens of Israeli hostages seized by the militant group on 7 October.\nA four-day pause in hostilities in the six-week-old war between Israel and Hamas is due to go into effect on Thursday, the culmination of weeks of diplomacy mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US.\nAn initial 10 hostages – children or elderly women – were expected to be released on Thursday morning, but late on Wednesday Israel’s national security adviser said the release would not happen before Friday.\n“Negotiations for the release of our captives are progressing and continue all the time,” Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said in a statement.\n“The start of the release will proceed according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday,” Hanegbi said.\nWhile details are still unclear, a source at the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority told the Guardian that it was thought that 50 Palestinian women and children would then be dropped off at the Beitunia checkpoint, near Ramallah, on Thursday afternoon.\nAs the families of abducted Israelis  endure an agonising wait to see if their loved ones will be able to return, excitement is also growing for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank that their imprisoned loved ones may also be coming home.\nAseel Osama Shadeh, 17, was arrested this month after carrying a Hamas flag to a protest at the notorious Qalandiya checkpoint between Ramallah and Jerusalem – an offence under Israeli law.\nHer father, Osama, said: “The Israeli soldiers shot her in the leg and arrested her, accusing her of carrying a knife, even though she was not.\n“My daughter is a stubborn girl. We are a quiet family but she would not listen to us. We thought she would spend many years in jail. We are really happy she will be released.”\nAccording to the Palestinian Prisoners Society, 7,200 prisoners are being held by Israel, among them 88 women and 250 children aged 17 and under. The plight of prisoners is a key issue for Palestinians: at least four in 10 Palestinian men spend at least some time in their life in Israeli prisons.\nThe hostage swap deal has also shone a light on Israeli detention and sentencing practices in the Palestinian territories, where Palestinians are tried in military courts and minors are regularly imprisoned.\nAll but four on the list of 300 are from the West Bank and Jerusalem. Israel refused to release anyone sentenced for murder; most are held for stone throwing, damaging property, having contact with “hostile” organisations, as well as more serious charges including stabbings and making explosives.\nMany are held in administrative detention , which allows for pre-emptive arrest, on secret evidence, and six-month extendable stints in prison without charge or trial.\nJessica Montell, the executive director of HaMoked, said: “Some [on the list] have been convicted; the bulk of those to be released are detainees still awaiting trial, on charges that range from incitement to stone-throwing to attempted murder.\n“Among those to be released are Palestinian women and children in administrative detention … These people should also have been released unconditionally, so a deal to release Israeli hostages and Palestinian administrative detainees is doubly welcome.”\nThe ceasefire deal includes a clause stipulating that for every 10 hostages that come home safely, there will be an additional day in which fighting is paused, up to a total of 10 days, and three times as many Palestinians in Israeli jails released.\nDuring the ceasefire, aid and fuel is expected to reach the besieged Gaza Strip, where more than 12,000 people have been killed and much of the territory’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced from their homes.\nIsrael has vowed to restart its war effort, launched in response to the Hamas killings of 1,200 Israelis on 7 October, after the initial goal of 50 out of 238 hostages are released.\nIsrael has a history of agreeing to asymmetric prisoner swaps: in 2011, Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, returned home after five years of captivity in the Gaza Strip in exchange for 1,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails.\nForemost among them was Yahya Sinwar , who returned home to Gaza, eventually becoming Hamas’s most important leader in the territory.\n This article was amended on 23 November 2023 to refer to “stabbings” rather than “attempted stabbings”.\nEnd of Document\nBenjamin Netanyahu warns war will continue until Hamas is eliminated"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28
"Hopes for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and Israel","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 17:48:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",593,""," Readers respond to an article by Jonathan Freedland on the nature of Hamas and Benjamin Netanyahu, and to an article by Raja Shehadeh","\nI regularly read Jonathan Freedland’s perceptive articles and appreciate his informed perspective. May I take issue with his contention that many of those who have been advocating a ceasefire in Gaza are making mistaken assumptions that lead them to draw false and dangerous conclusions ( Too many taking sides in this conflict miss the true nature of Hamas – and Netanyahu, 17 November  ). He claims they believe that “given all that Gaza has suffered, surely now Hamas will be deterred from future attacks”.\nIsraelis who have been calling for a ceasefire, I among them, harbour no such illusions about Hamas. We oppose further destruction of Gaza and the horrendous loss of life first of all, because we find it deeply immoral. Can this really be justified by Hamas’s unspeakable atrocities? And second, because these actions are counterproductive – they exacerbate the conflict, and have very likely delayed and complicated an agreement to release our hostages.\nGolda Meir is reputed to have said  : “We can forgive the Arabs for killing our children. We cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children.” This sentiment is sadly still so pervasive here in Israel. The population of Gaza is suffering? It’s all Hamas’s fault, they should have known what was coming to them. As if mighty Israel were merely the passive instrument of Hamas’s evil machinations. Until we accept some responsibility for our actions, the prospect for peace remains bleak. Avner GreenbergKfar Vradim, Israel\n In an otherwise informative article, it is a little difficult to believe that Jonathan Freedland is seriously suggesting that the US administration, and Israel’s other allies, are unaware that Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition are utterly opposed to a two-state solution. Tragically, a two-state solution seems beyond the current horizon, while the world is consumed with the aftermath of Hamas’s terror attack, Israel’s response, and the disagreements over calling for humanitarian pauses or a permanent ceasefire.\nRegarding a ceasefire, can we look back to the precedent of 1982? Hillel Schenker, co-editor of the Palestine-Israel Journal, has made a proposal on the Times of Israel  ’s website, arising from years of active involvement in the struggle for peace. His proposal is for a ceasefire founded essentially on the following conditions:\n(1) The exit of the Hamas leadership, perhaps to Qatar, similar to the exit of Yasser Arafat and the PLO leadership to Tunis in 1982 during the first Lebanon war.\n(2) An exchange of all Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners currently held in Israeli jails.\n(3) The creation of an interim international regime to rule over Gaza, organised by perhaps the US, European countries, UN agencies and Arab governments, this regime being a necessary precursor to a new Palestinian government in Gaza. Prof Stephen OginLondon\n Raja Shehadeh’s article about the failure of Israel to achieve a just peace after the six-day war ( Israel has long wanted Palestinians out of Gaza – my father saw it firsthand, 20 November  ) fails to mention the Khartoum resolution of 1 September 1967, which emerged from a summit of all the Arab heads of state. This declared that the framework of principles governing Arab collective action would include “no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it”. This gives a clearer context than anything in his article for Israel’s belief that its continued survival required it to retain control over the extra territory it had acquired in 1967.

He entered politics as a member of the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), but left over what he saw as the party’s mild stance on Islam and immigration.\nHe founded the Freedom party (PVV) in 2004, placing anti-Islam policies at the heart of his party.

I have said that I didn’t see that this country would have a leader who does not bring together all Dutch people, who is there for all of the Dutch, but above all I don’t see a majority forming”. \nShe denied that she had made a strategic error to open the door to Wilders, rather than excluding him as Mark Rutte had done for years. \n“I don’t think so,” she said. “This is about the worries of people who don’t feel listened to. \nThis result clearly shows that the concerns of the voters that we have been hammering on for months, and that - not for nothing - the government fell over, are real. Politics in general hasn’t picked up on these worries and offered good solutions. \nShe did not express any regrets. “I thought it was a good campaign, we all did our best and the voter has spoken and that’s the good thing about democracy. Now Mr Wilders has the lead and we will see.”\nThe right wing block does not have appeared to grow much - from 62 seats to 63 votes, based on exit polling - but they have been concentrated on the PVV, Dutch political experts pointed out on the NOS. \nTo have a majority, a government needs 76 of 150 seats.\n    Dutch party leader of VVD, Dilan Yesilgoz reacts to exit poll and early results in the Dutch parliamentary elections, in The Hague, Netherlands, November 22, 2023.

It’s important to realise that democracy is fragile and that we must cherish our democratic values. The right to vote is the foundation of our democratic rule of law.\nAnne, 28, from Amsterdam, said:\nI was on my way to the Westerkerk church, where I was going to vote and I thought this was an unusual location. It’s an extraordinary historical place of oppression and exclusion, to exercise your democratic right to vote. I knew which party to vote for, the person not so much. I voted for a woman from the GreenLeft/Labour. It’s not a strategic vote but I hope the PVV won’t win – I really hope it.\nMirjam Stoker, 52, from Amsterdam, went to the museum after voting for GreenLeft/Labour, having previously often voted Labour.\n“Anne Frank couldn’t vote and we have the freedom to do it – so it seemed like a beautiful thing to do. You get a pencil you can keep, which is lovely.\nI voted a bit strategically, and I hope that it is more left than right in the way it goes. I’m a bit scared of the PVV: government needs to stay a bit in the middle and I hope people keep talking. Wilders has said he won’t keep everything [in his manifesto] but that’s not my experience. But he was a good debater, the only one who could take on Rutte.”\nDiana, 61, of Surinamese background but born in the Netherlands and from Amsterdam, said: “I voted for my children and my grandchildren.

The environment and living conditions are the most important topics for me.

My parents are farmers and I know first-hand how much they struggle. Other parties go too far with their climate change proposals which is hurting normal working-class people. I don’t agree with everything that BBB proposes but I appreciate how they are trying to help the countryside.\nRuben Charbon, a small business owner in Amsterdam, said:\nI voted for GreenLeft/Labour because of our future. As I got older, I started thinking less about what benefits me directly and more about our role on this planet and about climate change.

"The Guardian view on a ceasefire in Gaza: a step forward, but this is far from over","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 19:08:00," OPINION; Version:3",640," Editorial"," Although the release of hostages and a pause in violence are essential in such desperate times, this is not a lasting solution","\nThe ceasefire and hostage release deal  between Israel and Hamas will be deeply felt. To some, it will mean everything. If it proceeds as agreed, the families of 50 women and children of Israeli and other nationalities, held hostage by Hamas since its murderous raids on 7 October, will at last be reunited with their loved ones – with the first release expected on Friday at the earliest. For traumatised families in Gaza, the deal will bring respite from relentless airstrikes and the prospect of desperately needed aid. It will also see the release of 150 Palestinian women and children from Israeli prisons.\nThere has been talk of such an arrangement for weeks. There is fury among relatives that hostages have ranked so low on Benjamin Netanyahu’s list of priorities: the Israeli prime minister did not meet family members until this week.  Hamas refused to provide identifying information  on hostages and threatened to cut talks over Israel’s raid on al-Shifa hospital. In the intervening time, several hostages have died, and thousands more Palestinians. Another 100 people in Gaza were killed within hours  of the deal being announced.\nNonetheless, the hope is that this brings, however belatedly, a critical change in dynamics. The deal, brokered by Qatar and the US, includes an option to extend the four-day ceasefire if more hostages are released. The sight of family reunions, and the suffering of hostages, might build support in Israel for a longer-term deal. A fuller picture of the devastation in Gaza, through access for outside journalists, is likely to increase international pressure. \nWhat this does not mean is an end to the war.  Almost 200 hostages will still be held. Martin Griffiths, the UN humanitarian chief, describes  the situation in Gaza as “the worst ever … complete and utter carnage”. Two-fifths of the estimated 14,000 dead are children, and 1.7 million people have been displaced – three-quarters of Gaza’s population. The emergency effort can offer only very limited relief: Oxfam called the deal “a Band-Aid that will be ripped off a bleeding wound after four days”. The Israel Defense Forces say that it is an “operational pause”, not a ceasefire, and Mr Netanyahu has stressed: “We’ll continue in the war.” Hamas insists  : “Our hands will remain on the trigger.”\nThe same forces that delayed this deal will work against its extension. Hamas will seek a higher price for the remaining hostages. Mr Netanyahu is fighting for political survival. While he carried this proposal  with the support of some of the extremists in his cabinet, the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, attacked it as “immoral”. Israel continues to state that its goal is eliminating Hamas. There is no sign that Israeli political opinion is cohering around a plan for what may come after the war  – still less any indication that the necessary international parties would sign up.\nIf matters proceed as arranged, however, it may at least lead to a longer-term diminution of the assault on Gaza. The Biden administration has already made it clear that it will not stomach a full-scale expansion of Israeli operations into the south. The offensive might resume at a lower intensity and continue indefinitely. Though this would be better than the 160 children  that the UN estimates have been killed each day, no one could celebrate it. This agreement is to be welcomed. It must be made to work and, if possible, built upon. But its limitations must be fully understood.\n                                                                   Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Health minister Shannon Fentiman announced the state will allocate $1.2m for a trial in the Sunshine Coast. It will be provided by Queensland health midwives employed under the midwife group practice model from the Sunshine Coast university hospital. It will only be available for low-risk births, and not twins or triplets. There is also a requirement that the home be close enough to the hospital in case of an emergency and that it be assessed as suitable. “Queensland women have spoken, and we have listened,” Fentiman said. “Queensland women deserve access to high-quality, respectful, and reliable maternity services, and this new service is a significant step towards expanding those options available.”\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.57am GMT\nblock-time published-time 6.45am GMT \nContinuing on the case seeking to free Iranian asylum seeker Ned Kelly Emeralds, and  Matthew Albert, Emerald’s counsel, told the federal court hearing that his client had tried to kill himself in detention, vowing “I will not go back to be tortured and killed by a regime I despise”. In one incident in 2015 Emeralds injured his neck, after which he was left mute.\nAlbert said that after the high court’s NZYQ decision cases of indefinite detention such as his client’s “should never happen again”.\nAlbert submitted that there was no real prospect of Emerald being deported: first, because he had no travel document after his Iranian passport expired; and secondly, because Iran has a policy of not accepting involuntary return, even of its citizens.\nAlbert submitted the commonwealth had “done nothing” to look for alternatives to Iran, and there was “not a skerrick” of evidence that his predicament could change in the foreseeable future.\n Greg Johnson, counsel for the commonwealth, said Emeralds was seeking to “ride on the coattails of the recent order” of the high court, for which reasons are yet to be given. The full decision may add “qualification” to the test in cases of “uncooperative” persons, he said.\nUnlike NZYQ, in which the impossibility of deportation was agreed by the parties, Johnson said in this case it was in dispute because it was the “applicant’s choice” not to return to Iran, Johnson submitted.\nThe commonwealth argued that it might be possible to deport Edwards if he met Iranian officials or gave them information to get a new travel document.\nEdwards had refused to cooperate with Iranian authorities because his parents and siblings are still in Iran and would be placed at risk if authorities knew he had sought asylum, the court heard. \nblock-time published-time 6.42am GMT \nThe federal court has reserved judgment in a case seeking to free Iranian asylum seeker Ned Kelly Emeralds, who has spent more than a decade in immigration detention.\nLawyers for Emeralds, including the Human Rights Law Centre, are hoping to use the new high court precedent of NZYQ to release the man, on the basis there is no prospect of deporting him.\nOn Thursday, justice Geoffrey Kennett labelled it a “particularly disturbing case” given the length of time in detention, but reserved judgment, likely to be delivered next week.\nEmeralds arrived in Australia by boat in 2013 and has been detained since that time. According to the Human Rights Law Centre, which represents him, Emeralds was detained while his protection visa application was processed; he has not had a visa cancelled, nor been sentenced for a crime.\nIn 2016, Emeralds was found to be owed protection by one officer of the Department of Home Affairs. A second officer refused his application for a protection visa in 2018 on the basis he did not have a well-founded fear of return.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.55am GMT\nblock-time published-time 6.37am GMT \nA group of people was detected at an isolated section of the northern Western Australian coast on Wednesday after arriving by boat, prompting Coalition accusations about resumption of dangerous boat journeys.\nThe Coalition has claimed the group, of whom 12 are currently in Australian Border Force custody, is the 10th people smuggling venture to reach Australia since the election of the Albanese government. It is not yet clear if they are asylum seekers or fishermen.\nThe Australian, which first reported the group’s arrival, said police from Kalumburu flew to the Truscott air base near where Wunambal Gaambera Aboriginal people found the new arrivals, who were reportedly “in poor shape”.\nContinue reading:\n Related:  Twelve people in border force custody after arriving by boat on isolated section of WA coast\nblock-time published-time 6.35am GMT \n Inquest into Wieambilla police deaths set for July 2024 \nHearings for the coroner’s inquest into the murder of two police officers at Wieambilla in Queensland in 2022 could run for as long as a month.\nCoroner Terry Ryan is looking into the deaths of Matthew Arnold and Rachel McCrow at a property outside Tara on 12 December 2022.

It is both Australians and Palestinians who want to help their loved ones, and if they connect them up with a visa, why would the Coalition have any problem with trying to get people out of harm’s way?\nUltimately, and why would they try to score crass political points, at the point of a hardship, and when people are feeling the weight and feeling anxiety and concern? … They should be asked why they have a problem with trying to help with Australians trying to help family and loved ones get out of harm’s way.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.37am GMT\nblock-time published-time 5.15am GMT \n Lehrmann ‘mistaken’ when telling AFP there was no alcohol in his office, court hears  \nThe federal court has heard Bruce Lehrmann was not telling the truth when he told Australian federal police in a formal interview used in his criminal trial there was no alcohol in his office.\nUnder cross-examination from Network Ten’s barrister, Dr Matt Collins SC, Lehrmann agreed there were several bottles of whisky and gin in his office when he worked for Senator Linda Reynolds in 2019.\nHe was shown photographs of his collection of bottles of alcohol and he agreed they were his.\nCollins: “You gave an interview didn’t you to the Australian federal police on the 19th of April 2021?”\n“And you understood the importance of telling the truth when you are attending that interview?”\nLehrmann: “Yes.”\nCollins told the federal court that at Lehrmann’s criminal trial in the ACT supreme court in October 2022 a video of the record of interview was played to the jury.

Adrian Banciu, 33, was last seen at his home at Macquarie Park, in the city’s north, on 12 November. Five days later after he had been reported missing, Mr Banciu contacted his family and emergency services saying he was lost in bushland close to Berowra Valley national park, on Sydney’s northern outskirts. Multiple police rescue units as well as the SES and Rural Fire Service began scouring bushland near Mt Kuring-Gai to try to find him. Police believe Mr Banciu was near an aquatic centre at Hornsby on the day after he was last spotted and he then entered some bush off Galston Road at Hornsby Heights. Extensive searches have taken place since he was last heard from, but he has not been found. Police and his family have serious concerns for his welfare. Mr Banciu is described as being of Caucasian appearance, about 175cm tall with a thin build and a black beard. He was last seen wearing a maroon flannelette shirt, tan shorts and black velcro sneakers. Police have called for anyone with information about his location to contact authorities.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.17am GMT\nblock-time published-time 12.39am GMT \n Confusion over status of $20bn takeover bid for Origin Energy \nOrigin Energy, one of the country’s biggest electricity generators, was intending to hold a 2pm aedt shareholders vote today in Sydney on a $20bn takeover bid by Brookfield and EIS. \n(The former is a Canadian asset investor and the latter, a US-based fossil fuel firm with some Saudi Arabian backing.)\nAnyway, initially pitched at a $18.7bn bid a year ago , and later sweetened to win over shareholders, the bid had looked likely to fail at today’s vote because of opposition from Australian Super. AusSuper holds about 17.5% and had looked likely to raise enough doubts among other shareholders to prevent the offer receiving the needed 75% approval.\nThe Australian Financial Review  has been reporting that the bidders had lobbed a “plan B”  arrangement should today’s offer fall over. It looks to be offering $9.20 a share rather than $9.43, and higher than yesterday’s close of Origin stock at $8.42. \nOrigin won’t comment on any revised offer and why it might be more attractive. It’s also not clear whether the vote will be postponed, but that seems likely. In any case, the stock is in a trading halt and we expect Origin to reveal more of what’s going on soon.\nBrookfield had proposed accelerating Origin’s decarbonisation, including spending $20bn-$30bn on new renewables.

It can’t be one-sided, but we need to make sure that what we’ve seen occur, beginning with the terrorist action October 7, of course was just devastating,” Albanese said.\n“And since then we’ve seen too much life being lost.

So these are people who have applied. They go through the usual security checks, the usual identity checks, the usual character checks, and have been granted visas.\nWhat I would also say is this – obviously just because someone has an Australian visa does not mean that they are able to leave where they are. And there are many people in Gaza who we have been trying to assist. As you know, border crossings have not been opened fully.\nAnd we spend weeks working with others to get some 127 Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families out of Gaza.

"Harvard journal accused of censoring article alleging genocide in Gaza","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 21:31:00," EDUCATION; Version:2",860," Robert Tait in Washington"," Harvard Law Review declined an essay by Palestinian doctoral candidate Rabea Eghbariah after it had been initially approved","\nA prestigious journal published by Harvard Law School has been accused of censorship after it refused to publish an academic article accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, allegedly because editors feared a backlash.\nThe Harvard Law Review, which is run by the school’s student body, declined the 2,000-word essay – titled The Ongoing Nakba: Towards a Legal Framework for Palestine – by a Palestinian doctoral candidate, Rabea Eghbariah, after it had been edited, fact-checked and initially approved.\nThe article, commissioned after Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, followed by an Israeli assault on Gaza, would have been the first by a Palestinian scholar ever published by the review. The Intercept originally broke the story.\nIt argued that events in Gaza – where more than 14,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its military offensive – met the terms of genocide as defined by the United Nations convention. The article also called for a legally recognised crime of “Nakba” (catastrophe), the Arab word used to describe the forced removal of Palestinians from their homes at the time of Israel’s founding in 1948.\nBut plans to publish it as a blogpost were abandoned after a crisis meeting of more than 100 editors. The rejection was reportedly driven by fears that publication might harm editors’ career prospects by provoking a backlash that could include having their personal details disclosed in an attempt at public shaming, a process known as “doxxing.”\nWorking on the review is a well-trodden path for law school students, who later advance to high-flying careers in politics, elite law firms, and clerkships at the US supreme court. Barack Obama served as the review’s president during his time as a Harvard law student.\nThe decision was criticised in a statement issued by 25 editors, who said such a rejection was unprecedented and motivated by fear.\n“At a time when the Law Review was facing a public intimidation and harassment campaign, the journal’s leadership intervened to stop publication,” they wrote, according to the Intercept. “The body of editors – none of whom are Palestinian – voted to sustain that decision. We are unaware of any other solicited piece that has been revoked by the Law Review in this way.”\nThe review’s editor, Apsara Iyer, told Eghbariah, in an email that the decision “was not based on your identity or viewpoint”.\nHowever, a separate email written by an online editor, Tascha Shahriari-Parsa, and reported by the Nation suggested otherwise.\n“The discussion did not involve any substantive or technical aspects of your piece,” Shahriari-Parsa told Eghbariah. “Rather, [it] revolved around concerns about editors who might oppose or be offended by the piece, as well as concerns that the piece might provoke a reaction from members of the public who might in turn harass, dox or otherwise attempt to intimidate our editors, staff and HLR leadership.”\nIn response, Eghabriah, a human rights attorney, complained to editors that the decision amounted to “discrimination” and “outright censorship”.\nThe article was eventually published by the Nation under the headline The Harvard Law Review Refused to Run This Piece About Genocide in Gaza.\nIn it, Eghbariah cites several scholars who argue that Israeli actions meet legal criteria for genocide, before adding: “And yet, leading law schools and legal scholars in the United States still fashion their silence as impartiality and their denial as nuance.\n“Palestine is where genocide can be performed as a fight of ‘ the civilised world  ’ against the ‘enemies of civilization’ itself. When contrasted with Jewish-Israeli life – the ultimate victims  of European genocidal ideologies – Palestinians stand no chance at humanisation. ”\nNoting that genocide was enshrined into the UN charter and international law due to the crimes of the Holocaust, he envisions a similar legally defined outcome for Palestinian experiences. “We must imagine that one day there will be a recognised crime of committing a Nakba, and a disapprobation of Zionism as an ideology based on racial elimination ,” he concludes.\nThe controversy over the article follows a series of rows that have engulfed Harvard and other universities in the wake of Hamas’s assault, which led to the killing of 1,200 people and the kidnapping of around 240 others.\nLarry Summers, a former Harvard president and US treasury secretary, denounced the university for failing to condemn an open letter left by a pro-Palestinian student group in the campus’s main courtyard in the immediate aftermath of the atrocities that put the blame on Israel.\n“In nearly 50 years of @Harvard affiliation, I have never been as disillusioned and alienated as I am today,” he tweeted. He said the letter and university officials’ failure to condemn it “allowed Harvard to appear at best neutral towards acts of terror against the Jewish state of Israel”.\nHis criticism prompted the current Harvard president, Claudine Gay, to publicly condemn Hamas’s “barbaric atrocities”. But she rejected calls to name and punish students who signed the open letter, saying the university “embraces a commitment to free expression”.\nEnd of Document\nGaza ceasefire deal brings relief but little hope of durable peace"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28
"Secrecy and public anger: how the Israel/Hamas ceasefire deal came about","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-22 23:10:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:3",1480," Julian Borger in Washington, Jason Burke in Jerusalem, and Ruth Michaelson in Istanbul"," Increasing pressure from the US and from the families of Israeli hostages were vital in securing agreement for the four-day truce","\nThe hostage deal that was finally agreed by the Israeli cabinet in the early hours of Wednesday was very similar in outline to what was on the table a month ago , according to sources familiar with the discussions.\nIn the intervening weeks, a lot has happened to turn the proposal to exchange women and children prisoners during a ceasefire into a near-reality.\nIsrael has mounted a ground offensive, seizing control of much of northern Gaza, and sending Hamas underground. The Israeli Defense Forces are now open to a tactical pause while decisions are made about how to move southwards.\nMeanwhile, the government of Benjamin Netanyahu has been under acute and mounting pincer pressure: from the Biden administration, and internally from the hostages’ families and their sympathisers, who have waged a relentless public campaign to put the captives’ lives first.\nThe first sign that Hamas was interested in a hostage deal came only a few days after its 7 October attack in which its gunmen killed 1,200 Israelis and took about 240 captive. The government in Qatar approached the White House to convey Hamas’s interest in negotiations, and suggested that a dedicated cell be set up involving a handful of US, Qatari and Israeli representatives, according to senior US officials.\nJake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, designated his Middle East coordinator, Brett McGurk, and Josh Geltzer, deputy White House counsel, to set up the cell, which was kept secret from the rest of the administration on Israeli and Qatari insistence.\nBiden and his team were focused in particular on 10 US nationals who had not been accounted for and were presumed to be among the hostages. On 13 October, the US president held a Zoom call with their families. A senior administration official said colleagues on the call described it as “one of the most gut-wrenching things they’ve experienced in their time here”.\nWhen Biden visited Israel five days later, he met the families of hostages in person, and their release was a main focus of his face-to-face meeting with Netanyahu, according to US officials. Three Americans were included in the final deal on Wednesday.\nAlongside Biden’s personal commitment, the White House came to see the hostage issue as the most likely route to persuading the Israeli government to ease its onslaught on Gaza,  which had flattened entire residential districts and killed thousands of Palestinian civilians.\nIn a bid to build confidence, Hamas released two American hostages on 20 October  and two Israelis four days later. Sullivan, McGurk and Sullivan’s deputy tracked the progress of the two Americans, Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter, Natalie, over several hours. For the Americans it was a “proof of concept” showing that Qatar could deliver the release of hostages as promised through the joint cell.\nAfter the initial hostage release, the Israelis authorised the Mossad director, David Barnea, as their lead negotiator, who worked with his US counterpart, William Burns, on the parameters of a larger deal. On 25 October, the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar,  signalled that he was ready to free all the children, women, elderly and sick among the estimated 240 hostages, in exchange for a greater number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails as well a five-day ceasefire.\nIsrael was just two days away from unleashing its ground offensive. Hundreds of tanks were massed along Gaza’s borders with 350,000 reservists called up. US and Israeli officials debated whether the assault should be delayed to give the offered deal a chance.\nNetanyahu’s government argued there was not enough substance to the Hamas offer, pointing out there still was no proof of life of any of the hostages. The Americans agreed, but according to US officials, the ground offensive plan was adapted to be carried out in phases so that it could be paused if a deal came together.\nOnce the ground offensive had been launched, Sinwar repeated his offer, even suggesting that he would accept a shorter ceasefire, and publicly voiced his readiness for a deal on 28 October. Netanyahu remained cautious, keenly aware at the time that any deal would split his rightwing coalition and possibly bring down his government, or at least strengthen the hand of centrists who had joined the war effort after the 7 October attack.\nAfter the bombing of the Jabalia refugee camp over three days  from 31 October to 2 November caused mass Palestinian casualties, Hamas temporarily cut off talks, but its boycott only lasted a few days. Communications would be cut again after the Israeli raid on al-Shifa hospital. Even when Sinwar was ready to talk, the dialogue was slow, a US official said, because he passed messages on handwritten notes rather than risking electronic communications.\nFrom the beginning of November, splits were clearly widening in the Israeli security establishment. Barnea and Burns visited Doha for a meeting with the Qatari prime minister, Mohammed al-Thani, but the sticking point for the Israelis remained the absence of a list of people whom Hamas claimed to be holding.\nHamas argued it was not able to produce all those details without a lull in the fighting. Many of the hostages, it appeared, were being held by other groups such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Gaza’s criminal clans, and were no longer under direct Hamas control.\nThe Qataris and intelligence chiefs also discussed the possibility of fuel shipments into Gaza, long resisted by Israel on the grounds that they would diverted by Hamas, and the idea of piecemeal deals involving the release of 10 to 15 hostages for operational pauses of a few days, but Netanyahu’s government wanted a bigger deal if it was to do a deal at all.\nOn 12 November, Biden called the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, in a bid to break the deadlock, and insisted that some sort of identifying information had to be produced. Shortly after this call, Hamas produced data on the first 50 hostages it said would be freed in the first phase of any deal.\nOver the course of November, Washington steadily built up the pressure on Netanyahu to do a deal, making sure a constant stream of US officials was visiting Tel Aviv. “We are going to keep in their face,” a US diplomat said at the time.\nPublicly, the administration toughened its tone on the humanitarian consequences of the Israeli offensive, broke with Netanyahu by insisting that the Palestinian Authority run Gaza after the war, and declared the imposition of visa bans on Israeli settlers implicated in violence towards Palestinians on the West Bank.\n“What really got everyone’s attention was the signal that there would be potential repercussions for the settlers,” a source familiar with the negotiations said.\nOn Tuesday, the US national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said the administration would not support the extension of the Israeli military campaign to southern Gaza “absent a clearly articulated plan for how they’re going to protect the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people that have now added to the population in the south because they were asked to leave by the Israelis”.\nBy mid-November, the Americans were pushing at an open door, as Netanyahu became more receptive. When the White House Middle East coordinator, Brett McGurk, visited the prime minister on 15 November, a senior US official said, Netanyahu grabbed him by the arm and said: “We need this deal.”\nThe political calculus in Israel had changed as the hostages’ relatives steadily became more vocal and more effective inside Israel, culminating in a televised shouting match with the far-right ministry of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, which helped to isolate the extremists, clearing the way for a cabinet vote in favour of the deal on Wednesday morning.\n“I think the families did the heavy lifting,” said Daniel Levy, president of the US/Middle East Project.\n“What went on was that the families over time were convinced that the focus of their action had to be at home, that the place they needed to tip that had the power of decision-making was their own government.”\nThe final text was hammered out in Doha on 18 November between McGurk and prime minister al-Thani, who passed a text on to Hamas. The next day McGurk went to Cairo to meet the Egyptian intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, to receive Hamas’s response and make last-minute tweaks.\nThe current deal can be extended; an extra day of ceasefire will be added for every 10 further hostages that Hamas releases. US diplomats say they are hopeful that the pause can be used to significantly address the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. The Qataris, meanwhile, say they are hopeful that it could lead to a long-term ceasefire.\n“That is probably unrealistic,” said a source who has been in regular contact with Doha. “Everyone else we talk to believes that after this break, it will get a lot worse.”\nEnd of Document\nHopes for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and Israel"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28
"Adviser warns UK government against tightening laws on glorifying terrorism","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-23 00:01:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",590," Daniel Boffey Chief reporter"," Independent reviewer says change could harm freedom of speech and further strain overtaxed security services","\nNo 10 should not implement plans to amend the law on glorifying terrorism after the pro-Palestine marches as it would do “no favours” to police, MI5 or the probation service, a government adviser has said.\nIn a 15-page report submitted to the Home Office, Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said there was no need to respond to the marches with new terrorism legislation, adding that there was “good reason for caution” given both the risk of unintended consequences and the drain on limited state resources.\nMinisters have said they want to tighten the law on glorifying terrorism after the conduct of a minority of people on the pro-Palestine demonstrations in recent weeks, including the chanting of the controversial slogan  “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, prompted calls for change. Some view the words as antisemitic and as encouraging the destruction of Israel.\nIn his advice to the home secretary, James Cleverly, Hall wrote that changes to terrorism legislation would not be the right course given the utmost seriousness of the crimes they cover, the need for precision in the law and the risk of inflicting “excessive damage” on the right to free speech.\nHe said: “My overall conclusion is that there is no need to legislate for any amendments to terrorism legislation now, and good reason for caution.\n“It is difficult to identify any real situations where a gap in terrorism legislation means that terrorist mischief cannot currently be addressed by arrest and prosecution.\n“Given the number of pro-Palestine marchers, there have been plenty of opportunities for gaps to become apparent. There may well be other mischiefs (such as antisemitism), but those are not a subject for terrorism legislation.\n“There is a general risk of legislating in response to one set of protests because of the risk of unintended consequences when new legislation comes to be applied to other protests.”\nHall added that to “extend the poll of terrorist offences unnecessarily” would impose further burdens on the already stretched security services.\n“Either the investigative authorities dramatically shift their resources or ignore new terrorist offences,” he warned. “If individuals are convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment, this has major resource implications for their management in prison and on release.”\nThe glorifying of terrorism is already a criminal offence, but only if people could reasonably infer that there is an encouragement to emulate the conduct. Hall warned that broadening the offence should be immediately ruled out.\nHe wrote: “The terrorism definition applies just as well to the anti-apartheid actions of Nelson Mandela and the revolutionary battles of Scotland’s William Wallace as to the terrorist attacks on 7 October 2023. There are plenty of other examples. A general solution of prohibiting all reference to terrorists or terrorist acts at public marches can therefore be rejected at the outset.”\nHall said it was already an offence to belong to a proscribed organisation, wear an article linked to it, to deliberately invite support for it or recklessly encourage support for it, and that the laws had been precisely written to target those who pose a real danger to the public.\nHe wrote: “Especially on political matters or questions of public interest, members of the public should not be daunted from exercising their freedom of expression and right of lawful assembly based on laws which are vague or which they cannot be expected to understand.”\nEnd of Document\nGaza truce due to begin, call for childcare boost, King’s secret ‘vacant goods’ profit"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28
"Gaza ceasefire to begin on Friday morning with hostage releases to follow","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-23 04:25:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",1441," Jason Burke in Jerusalem"," Negotiators work out final details of four-day truce between Israel and Hamas after seven weeks of conflictIsrael-Hamas war: live updatesIsrael and Palestine: a complete guide to the crisis","\nA four-day <span class="">ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas will begin on Friday morning, a day later than originally announced, after negotiators worked out final details of the deal, which will lead to the release of dozens of hostages held by militants as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n                     <span class="">The diplomatic breakthrough promises the first pause in seven weeks of war in Gaza and some relief both for the 2.3 million Palestinians in the territory who have endured intensive Israeli bombardment, and for families in Israel fearful for the fate of their loved ones taken captive during the bloody attack launched last month by Hamas that triggered the conflict.\nThe exchange of female and child hostages and prisoners was due to take place on Thursday but was postponed as last-minute logistical issues were worked out during 24 hours of frantic diplomacy.\nSources close to the negotiations said Israel had presented a series of late requests for clarification of practical issues, and demanded the full identification of the hostages Hamas intended to release.\nCommunication between the parties has to pass from Israeli officials to Qatar, then to Hamas leaders outside Gaza and finally those inside the territory, a process that slowed any resolution of outstanding issues, the sources said.\nOn Thursday, Majed al-Ansari, the spokesperson for the foreign ministry of Qatar, announced the ceasefire would start at 7am local time on Friday (0500 GMT).\nHe said the two sides had exchanged lists of those to be released, and the first group of hostages held by Hamas – 13 women and children – would be freed on Friday afternoon. Increased aid for Palestinians would start to enter “as soon as possible”, Ansari said.\nThe senior Israeli official in charge of arrangements for the hostage release, Brig Gen Gal Hirsch, confirmed Israel had received a list of the names of the hostages to be freed.\n“Liaison officers have informed all of those families whose loved ones appear on the list, as well as all of the hostages’ families,” Hirsch said.\nReports in Israel  suggest the hostages will be released across the Rafah border crossing into Egypt and then be brought to Israel by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent (ICRC).\nThe truce, initially lasting four or five days, was announced early on Wednesday  after days of speculation and has raised hopes for a more durable pause in the violence.\nUnder the agreement, Hamas will free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages  it has held since launching bloody attacks into southern Israel on 7 October. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.\nThere will be a halt to Israeli military flights over southern Gaza, with air activity over northern Gaza restricted to six hours a day. Israel has agreed not to arrest anyone in Gaza for the duration of the truce, according to a Hamas statement.\nHamas is understood to be particularly concerned by the prospect of surveillance by drones during the release of hostages, a process that would expose their militants and potentially some of their infrastructure or even whereabouts of key leaders.\nThe hostages to be freed are women and children, and the Palestinian prisoners are also women and children, both sides have confirmed.\nIf the first exchanges go well, and Hamas can locate more female hostages or children, there will be further releases on both sides, reports suggest. Some sources have suggested the ceasefire could run for up to 10 days.\nThe deal, struck after lengthy and complex talks mediated by Qatar , the US and Egypt, comes more than six weeks after the conflict began last month. At least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October, and more than 240 people taken hostage.\nThe Israeli offensive has killed between 13,000 and 14,000 people, thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials. More are thought to be under rubble. Swaths of northern Gaza have been destroyed in the fighting, and up to a million people displaced.\nIsrael says it has killed thousands of Hamas fighters, without presenting evidence for its count.\nAhead of the ceasefire, fighting continued at even greater than normal intensity, with Israeli jets hitting more than 300 targets and troops engaged in heavy fighting around Jabalia refugee camp north of Gaza City.\nNGOs working with Palestinian prisoners said the arrangements for their release from Israeli jails was unclear even as late as Thursday evening, with continuing discussions about where they would be freed by Israeli authorities.\nThe prisoners to be freed are understood to come from across the occupied West Bank.\nAnsari did not give details on how many Palestinian women and children will be released from Israeli jails on Friday or when this would take place. He said Doha expected they would be released by Israel as part of this reciprocal deal.\nAn operations room in Doha will monitor the truce and the release of hostages and has direct and real-time lines of communication with Israel, the Hamas political office in Doha and the ICRC.\n“The important thing is that we maintain a very clear line of communication with everybody through the operations room and make sure that the environment which the hostage transfer will happen will be a safe one … We all hope that this truce will lead to a chance to start a wider work to achieve a permanent truce,” Ansari said.\nObtaining full details identity of hostages has been a problem throughout the negotiations, which may indicate Hamas does not hold or have access to all the hostages, some observers say.\nThough the deal has raised hopes of a more durable cessation of hostilities Netanyahu has vowed it will be temporary and will not end the campaign to destroy Hamas.  \nThe Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said during a visit to a naval base on Thursday: “This will be a short respite, at the end of which the fighting will continue intensely, and we will create pressure to bring back more hostages. At least another two months of fighting is expected.”\nThe delay in implementing the ceasefire dismayed uprooted Palestinians in Gaza, who hope to use the few days of quiet to visit homes they had fled – or what remains of them – and find missing relatives.\n“We’d been waiting and hoping since yesterday,” said Aya Hamad, who is sheltering at a hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah. “We wanted to go home to get a change of clothes for our children, even though we know our homes have been bombed … It’s all for nothing.”\nIsraeli troops hold much of northern Gaza and say they have dismantled tunnels and much of Hamas’s infrastructure there.\nAl-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the territory’s largest medical centre, has been the focus of <span class="">a fierce battle of narratives over both sides’ allegedly reckless endangerment of civilians. Hamas and hospital staff deny Israeli allegations that the facility was used as a militant command centre and that the group systematically uses civilians as a human shield.\nIsraeli soldiers on Wednesday escorted journalists to a tunnel shaft they said was part of a vast underground network used by Hamas for military purposes – a claim Hamas denies.\nIsraeli military spokesperson Col Richard Hecht said combat operations would continue “until we are given the order to hold our fire”. The Israeli military has said it is pursuing Hamas fighters in Jabaliya, a dense urban district adjacent to Gaza City that has come under intense bombardment for weeks.\nFor Hamas, the ceasefire would provide an opportunity to regroup after weeks of apparently heavy losses. The release of Palestinian prisoners will also be a major propaganda coup for Hamas. Its leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, is likely to declare victory if the war ends now.\nNetanyahu and the Israeli military want to push ahead with the offensive, in the belief that military pressure on Hamas will force concessions and eventually the release of all the hostages.\nHezbollah, the Lebanon-based militant Islamist militia and political movement, was not part of the recent negotiations, but has said it will join the ceasefire nonetheless. Tensions remain high on Israel’s northern border, with constant exchanges of fire.\nEarly on Thursday, Hezbollah announced that five fighters had been killed including the son of the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc.

The truce, initially lasting four or five days, was announced early on Wednesday  and has raised hopes for a more durable pause in the violence.The release of hostages is expected to follow on Friday afternoon. Israel and Hamas have exchanged lists of those to be released, with Hamas expected to free 13 women and children,  Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Ansari said. He did not specify how many Palestinian women and children will be released on Friday or when this would take place. Israel has notified the families  of the hostages set to be released on Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said .Joe Biden said he has his “fingers crossed”  that a three-year-old Israeli-American girl will be released.Overall, Hamas has agreed to free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages it has held since launching bloody attacks into southern Israel on 7 October, under the terms of the agreement. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.In a separate agreement, Hamas is set to unconditionally release 23 Thai hostages it is holding in Gaza, according to a report by the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news site.  The release of Thai hostages came after Iran-mediated talks , the outlet reported on Thursday.A special flight has evacuated 103 Russian nationals from Gaza , Russia’s emergencies ministry said early on Friday. In a post on Telegram, the ministry said the group flew to Moscow aboard a chartered Ilyushin-76 aircraft, Reuters reported.

More than 650 had been flown to Russia, including more than 300 children.The exchange of Palestinian and Israeli female and child hostages and prisoners had been due to take place on Thursday but was postponed as last-minute logistical issues were worked out. Sources close to the negotiations said  Israel had presented a series of late requests for clarification of practical issues, and demanded the full identification of the hostages Hamas intended to release.The diplomatic breakthrough promises the first pause in seven weeks of war in Gaza and some relief both for the 2.3 million Palestinians in the territory who have endured intensive Israeli bombardment, and for families in Israel fearful for the fate of their loved ones.Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said the military will resume fighting against Hamas “with intensity” for at least two more months.

Mohammad abu Salmiya and other medics were detained, a colleague said, amid reports  that the IDF had seized them as they were travelling with a World Health Organization evacuation convoy.

His remarks gave the impression that Netanyahu is not currently interested in anything but a military solution  to the future of Israel’s security.Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has urged Israel to rethink its offensive in Gaza, telling its president and prime minister the number of dead Palestinians is “truly unbearable”, and that the response to Hamas’s terrorist attacks last month cannot include “the deaths of innocent civilians,  including thousands of children”.\nblock-time published-time 1.36am GMT \nA special flight has evacuated 103 Russian nationals from Gaza, Russia’s emergencies ministry said early on Friday.\nIn a post on Telegram, the ministry said the group flew to Moscow aboard a chartered Ilyushin-76 aircraft, Reuters reported.\nThe post said 101 Russian nationals had been taken from Gaza to Egypt in the past 24 hours, bringing to more than 750 the total number of Russian evacuees.

According to official figures, Germany hosts an estimated 450 members of Hamas, proscribed as a “terrorist” organisation by the European Union, the US and Israel.\nThe ministry said that while Hamas members had not staged “violent action” in Germany so far, they had tried to raise funds to help the group overseas and “influence the social and political discourse in Germany”.\nIt said Samidoun on the other hand was “prone to use violence... and denies the right of Israel to exist”.\n     German police officers leave an apartment block during a raid against Hamas supporters in Berlin, Germany on Thursday.

Here’s a recap of the latest developments:\nA four-day ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas will beginat 7am local time on Friday (0500 GMT), Majed al-Ansari, the spokesperson for the foreign ministry of Qatar, has announced.  The truce, initially lasting four or five days, was announced early on Wednesday  after days of speculation and has raised hopes for a more durable pause in the violence.Under the agreement, Hamas will free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages it has held since launching bloody attacks into southern Israel on 7 October. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.The exchange of female and child hostages and prisoners was due to take place on Thursday but was postponed as last-minute logistical issues were worked out during 24 hours of frantic diplomacy. Sources close to the negotiations said  Israel had presented a series of late requests for clarification of practical issues, and demanded the full identification of the hostages Hamas intended to release.The two sides had exchanged lists of those to be released, and the first group of hostages held by Hamas – 13 women and children – would be freed on Friday afternoon,  Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Ansari said. Israel’s prime minister’s office confirmed it has received an “initial” list  of the hostages expected to be released at 4pm local time on Friday.  Joe Biden has said he has his “fingers crossed”  that a three-year-old Israeli-American girl taken hostage on 7 October will be released on Friday.The diplomatic breakthrough promises the first pause in seven weeks of war in Gaza and some relief both for the 2.3 million Palestinians in the territory who have endured intensive Israeli bombardment, and for families in Israel fearful for the fate of their loved ones taken captive during the bloody attack launched last month by Hamas that triggered the conflict.Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said the military will resume fighting against Hamas “with intensity” for at least two more months once the “short” temporary pause ends. He told troops to “organise, get ready, investigate, resupply arms, and get ready to continue” during the ceasefire. “This respite will be short,”  he said on Thursday.Israel’s army has arrested the director of Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital and bombed at least 300 targets from the air, killing dozens of Palestinians. Mohammad abu Salmiya and other medics were detained, a colleague said, amid reports that members of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) had seized them as they were travelling with a World Health Organization evacuation convoy. The IDF confirmed Abu Salmiya had been arrested and transferred to the Shin Bet domestic security service for further questioning.The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has said it is “deeply worried” about the director of its medical clinic in Khan Yunis,  who it said was arrested by Israeli forces and whose whereabouts is unknown. Awni Khattab was arrested  on Wednesday when a convoy transporting the wounded from al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza went through a checkpoint that separates north and south Gaza, the PRCS said in a statement.Gaza’s health ministry has resumed its detailed count of casualties from the Israel-Hamas war in the territory.  The director of the health ministry, which is run by the Hamas-run government, said it has documented more than 13,000 deaths , and that another 6,000 people have been reported missing and are feared buried under the rubble. Israel’s assault on Gaza followed the Hamas attack on 7 October which killed at least 1,200 Israelis.David Cameron has met Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, during a visit to Israel,expressing hope  that the planned temporary truce with Hamas would be an “opportunity to crucially get hostages out and get aid into Gaza”.Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has urged Israel to rethink its offensive in Gaza, telling its president and prime minister the number of dead Palestinians is “truly unbearable”, and that the response to Hamas’s terrorist attacks last month cannot include “the deaths of innocent civilians,  including thousands of children”.\nblock-time published-time 6.39pm GMT \nA spokesperson for the Qatari government has said a four-day ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas will begin at 7am on Friday, after Hamas and Israel exchanged lists of people to be released from Israeli prisoners and hostages taken to Gaza. \n Majed al-Ansari said he could not disclose how many Palestinians would be freed but that 13 people would be released by Hamas from Gaza. “All the women and children and those hostages from the same families will be put together within the same patch,” Ansari said.\nHere’s a clip from his press briefing earlier:\nblock-time published-time 6.26pm GMT \n Back in London, John Casson, David Cameron’s former chief foreign policy adviser in Downing Street, criticised Benjamin Netanyahu’s strategy, saying it was teaching hatred of Israel among Palestinians. \nHe also called for a change to the ageing leadership of the Palestinian Authority.\nIn his main critique, he argued it was right to say “we stand with Israelis and say ‘never again’ to facing the terrorist horror of the last month – that is not the same as to say we endorse and enable what prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his partners are saying and doing because the two things are at odds.\nThe current approach is not making the Israelis safe and secure for the long term but creating a traumatised generation of Palestinians and teaching them that Israel is their enemy and it is undermining the prospects of a two-state solution and deliberately dismantling it.\nblock-time published-time 6.19pm GMT \n David Cameron has met Benjamin Netanyahu  and the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, during a visit to Israel, expressing hope that the planned temporary truce with Hamas would be an “opportunity to crucially get hostages out and get aid into Gaza”. \nThe Israeli prime minister told the new UK foreign secretary that the precondition for peace in the Middle East was the eradication of what Netanyahu called the “genocidal terrorist cult” Hamas. His remarks gave the impression that Netanyahu is not currently interested in anything but a military solution to the future of Israel’s security.\nCameron’s visit to Jerusalem and Ramallah, the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, came on another dramatic day surrounding the release of hostages, and Palestinian political prisoners.\nNetanyahu insisted Israel would continue with its plans to destroy Hamas, saying: \nWe’ll continue with our war aims, namely to eradicate Hamas, because Hamas has already promised that they will do this again and again and again. They’re a genocidal terrorist cult. There’s no hope for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, between Israel and the Arab states, if we don’t eradicate this murderous movement that threatens the future of all of us.\nIt is understood Cameron discussed the impact of the conflict on civilians and the need to take all possible measures to minimise civilian casualties, and urged the Israelis to take action to end settler violence in the West Bank. The UK foreign secretary highlighted the need to use Kerem Shalom border crossing to scale up scanning and inspections to get more trucks in to Gaza.\nblock-time published-time 6.07pm GMT \n Israel to continue 'intense' fighting for at least two months after 'short' truce, says defence minister  \nIsrael’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said the military will resume fighting against Hamas “with intensity” for at least two more months once the “short” temporary pause ends.\nGallant, addressing troops of the Israeli navy special operations unit on Thursday, was quoted by the Times of Israel as saying:\nWhat you will see in the coming days is first the release of hostages.

Israel has repeatedly claimed that Hamas ran a command and control centre from tunnels running near and under the hospital, although so far the evidence presented has fallen short of that. \nThe IDF took a group of journalists to visit the tunnels on Wednesday, and video reports  appeared showing lengthy tunnels reinforced with concrete blocks. A bathroom and an empty tiled room with electric sockets could be seen on the footage , although its purpose could not be discerned from the filmed material.\nDaniel Hagari, the IDF’s spokesperson, said on Wednesday evening the footage showed that “Hamas built tunnels underneath hospitals, used them to command their operations”, and accused the group of “using the protected status of the hospitals as a shield”.\n    Israeli soldiers show the media an underground tunnel found below al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.

The Wall Street Journal has an account, which it sources to senior Egyptian officials. Jared Malsin and Summer Said write  :\nSenior Egyptian officials said Hamas failed to formally sign off on the mechanism for the hostages’ release, and didn’t provide Israel with a specific list of around a dozen or more to be freed first. \nIsrael for its part delayed the handover of a list of the first group of Palestinian prisoners it plans to free, according to officials familiar with the talks. \nAmong the technical issues gumming up the process is access by the International Committee of the Red Cross to the released hostages, and negotiations over the exit through which they will leave Gaza, according to officials familiar with the situation.\nIsrael had wanted the hostages to be handed over to the Red Cross before their transfer to Israel, while Hamas is now asking for them to be given directly to Egypt, the officials said. Israel has also asked that the Red Cross be given access to those hostages who remain in Gaza after the first exchange, something Hamas hasn’t agreed to.\nblock-time published-time 1.12pm GMT \nHere is the full IDF statement on the detention of Muhammad Abu Salmiya, the director of al-Shifa hospital:\nThe director of the al-Shifa hospital in the Gaza Strip was apprehended and transferred for ISA questioning following evidence showing that the al-Shifa hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control centre. The Hamas terror tunnel network situated under the hospital also exploited electricity and resources taken from the hospital. In addition, Hamas stored numerous weapons inside the hospital and on the hospital grounds.\nFurthermore, after the Hamas massacre on 7 October, Hamas terrorists sought refuge within the hospital, some of them taking hostages from Israel with them. A pathological report also confirmed the murder of CPL Noa Marciano on the hospital premises.\nIn the hospital, under his management, there was extensive Hamas terrorist activity. Findings of his involvement in terrorist activity will determine whether he will be subject to further ISA questioning.\nThe IDF also rereleased the statement from the Israeli military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, yesterday, in which he said: “Now, the irrefutable truth of Hamas’s exploitation of hospitals in Gaza is on full display to the world. We have an important question to ask the international community: what will you do to stop Gaza’s hospitals from being turned into terror bases in the future? Will you condemn Hamas? Or will you continue to be silent? Will you remain silent? I want to make it clear that Israel is at war with Hamas. We are not at war with the people of Gaza.”\nHamas and medical staff within Gaza’s hospitals have repeatedly denied the Israeli accusation.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.19pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 1.02pm GMT \n Israeli military says it has detained director of al-Shifa hospital for questioning  \n The Israeli military confirmed  today that the director of al-Shifa hospital in the Gaza Strip had been held for questioning. Muhammad Abu Salmiya was reportedly detained while heading to the south of the Gaz a Strip. \nReuters reports that Israel said it was questioning him over evidence that the facility had been used as a command and control centre for the Islamist movement Hamas.\n“In the hospital, under his management, there was extensive Hamas terrorist activity,” the military said in a statement.\nAbu Salmiya had frequently spoken to international media over the course of the conflict about conditions in and around the hospital during the Israeli bombardment and siege of the Gaza Strip.\nIsrael has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its activities, which Hamas and medical staff have repeatedly denied.\nEarlier this week Israel released footage, which showing reinforced tunnels allegedly used by Hamas, with what the IDF said showed a meeting room, kitchen and bathroom.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.31pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 12.26pm GMT \n A spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross has told Al Jazeera that its staff were fired upon while trying to deliver humanitarian support in northern Gaza. \nIt said: “Healthcare workers have special protection under international law and we are pressing for immediate protection for all civilians,” adding that hospitals in Gaza had been “turned into cemeteries and war fields”.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.04pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 12.15pm GMT \n Dani Dayan , chair  of Jerusalem’s Yad Vashem World Holocaust  memorial centre, has told AFP that comparisons between the Hamas attack on 7 October and the Holocaust were “simplistic”, even if “the genocidal intentions, sadism and barbarism of Hamas” had similarities with Nazi atrocities. \nHe told the news agency: “The crimes that took place on 7 October are on the same level as Nazi crimes, but they are not the Shoah. I do not accept the simplistic comparison with the Holocaust even if there are similarities in the genocidal intentions, sadism and barbarism of Hamas.\n“For any Jew who has heard the stories of families putting their hands over a baby’s mouth to stop it from crying, the association of ideas is obvious. We have all thought about it.”\nDayan said, however, that aside from the scale of the events, unlike many of the Jews targeted during the second world war, Israelis are far from defenceless victims, and the state has hit back hard.\n“We cannot compare it with the period of the Holocaust because there is an army here, which is fighting and making Hamas pay the price,” he said.\nDayan has previously criticised Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, who pinned a yellow star to his chest insisting he would wear it until the UN security council condemned the Hamas attack. “This act disgraces the victims of the Holocaust,” Dayan said at the time.\nHe has also criticised the UN secretary general, António Guterres, who had said the Hamas attacks “did not happen in a vacuum”.\n“I asked him what context could explain the beheading of children, rapes or shootings of young people at a music festival,” Dayan said.\nThe memorial centre itself counts some of its own staff among the victims of 7 October.

In a further BBC interview on Tuesday he expressed the hope that Cameron’s appointment will see the UK start to chart some positions ahead of Israel and the Palestinians into which the two sides could then enter.\nHe also called for a new generation of Palestinian leaders in the West Bank, saying the absence of elections means they have lost legitimacy.\nThere is no suggestion that Casson, a former British ambassador to Egypt until 2018, is speaking with the foreign secretary’s approval. But knowing Cameron well, he said he thought the foreign secretary was clear-eyed about Netanyahu, but also put great store by personal relationships.\nCasson said the UK should scale up the amount of humanitarian aid being sent to the Palestinians, arguing the money offered so far was a fraction of what was offered by the UK three or four years ago.\nHe also said Cameron needed to impress on the Israelis there was not a solely military solution to defeating Hamas, arguing a military response “has to create space for a strategic response and not undercut it”.\nIn his key critique, he argued: “When we say we stand with Israelis and say never again to face the terrorist horror of the last month – that is not the same as to say we endorse and enable what prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his partners are saying and doing because the two things are at odds.\n“The current approach is not making the Israelis safe and secure for the long term but creating a traumatised generation of Palestinians and teaching them that Israel is their enemy, and it is undermining the prospects of a two-state solution, and deliberately dismantling it.”\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.14am GMT\nblock-time published-time 10.08am GMT \nHere are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Gaza and Israel.\n    An Israeli soldier sits in a Merkava tank near the Israel-Gaza border.

The government in Qatar approached the White House to convey Hamas’s interest in negotiations, and suggested that a dedicated cell be set up involving a handful of US, Qatari and Israeli representatives, according to senior US officials.\nJake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, designated his Middle East coordinator, Brett McGurk, and Josh Geltzer, the deputy White House counsel, to set up the cell, which was kept secret from the rest of the administration on Israeli and Qatari insistence.\nBiden and his team were focused in particular on 10 US nationals who had not been accounted for and were presumed to be among the hostages. On 13 October, the US president held a Zoom call with their families. A senior administration official said colleagues on the call described it as “one of the most gut-wrenching things they’ve experienced in their time here”.\nWhen Biden visited Israel five days later, he met the families of hostages in person, and their release was a main focus of his face-to-face meeting with Netanyahu, according to US officials. Three Americans were included in the final deal on Wednesday.\nAlongside Biden’s personal commitment, the White House came to see the hostage issue as the most likely route to persuading the Israeli government to ease its onslaught on Gaza,  which had flattened entire residential districts and killed thousands of Palestinian civilians.\n Related:  Secrecy and public anger: how the Israel/Hamas ceasefire deal came about\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.17am GMT\nblock-time published-time 7.01am GMT \nThe Israeli military (IDF) says it struck more than 300 “Hamas terror targets” in total over the past day.\nIn a Telegram post the IDF said it had struck “military command centres, underground terror tunnels, weapon storage facilities, weapon manufacturing sites and anti-tank missile posts”.\nIt also said Israeli forces were currently striking Jabiliya in northern Gaza, where dozens of people were reported killed on Wednesday.\nAs we reported earlier , about 50 of the victims in Jabiliya on Wednesday were from the same family, according to Riyad al-Maliki, the Palestinian foreign minister.\nblock-time published-time 6.51am GMT \nThe German interior ministry says it is conducting searches in four federal states in relation to formerly announced bans of activities of Hamas, already a designated terrorist organisation in the country, as well as pro-Palestinian group Samidoun, Reuters reports.\n“We continue our consistent action against radical Islamists,” German interior minister Nancy Faeser said in a statement.\n“With the bans on Hamas and Samidoun in Germany, we have sent a clear signal that we will not tolerate any glorification or support of the barbaric terror of Hamas against Israel,” Faeser added.\nblock-time published-time 6.49am GMT \n Dozens of unidentified Palestinians buried in mass grave in Khan Younis, AFP reports  \nThe bodies of dozens of unidentified people were buried on Wednesday in a mass grave at a cemetery in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip, AFP reports. The agency writes:\nWrapped in blue tarpaulin, the bodies were lowered on stretchers, some of them stained with blood, into a sandy pit that was gradually enlarged by a digger. Some were the size of children.\n“As these martyrs had no one to say goodbye to, we dug a mass grave to bury them. They are unknown martyrs,” Bassem Dababesh of the emergency committee at the religious affairs ministry told AFP.\n    Palestinians bury unidentified people killed in the Israeli airstrikes in a mass grave in the town of Khan Younis.

If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes I wouldn’t have believed it,” said Umm Mohammed al-Ran, a woman evacuated from the Indonesian hospital towards Rafah in the south.\n“Wounded people died in front of us as they bled out,” she told AFP.\n    Palestinians pray next to the bodies of 111 unidentified people killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza, during their burial in a mass grave in Khan Younis.

The official said they were optimistic the agreement would be carried out once it was signed.\nWhite House spokesperson Adrienne Watson said final logistical details for the hostage release were being worked out. “That is on track and we are hopeful that implementation will begin on Friday morning,” Watson said.\nOther key developments:\nUnder the agreement, Hamas will free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages they took on 7 October. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza after more than six weeks of bombardment, heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.The deal, struck after lengthy and complex talks mediated by Qatar, the US and Egypt, came more than six weeks after the conflict began on 7 October, when Hamas launched attacks from Gaza into southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 240 people hostage. The Israeli offensive has killed between 13,000 and 14,000 people, thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has warned that “the war continues” despite the deal for a temporary ceasefire and release of some hostages. At a briefing on Wednesday, he also said part of the deal with Hamas stipulates that representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will be allowed to visit the hostages that remain in Gaza after some of them are returned. The ICRC earlier on Wednesday said it had “not been made aware of any agreement…related to visits by the ICRC to the hostages”.A coalition of aid agencies have warned that the four-day ceasefire left almost no time to provide effective humanitarian relief to Gaza’s 2.3 million people.  In a briefing on Wednesday, they argued the only effective response would be a permanent or durable end to the war and that it remained unclear if there would be sufficient access, particularly to the north of the strip, to allow anything beyond cursory relief.Palestinian and Israeli officials have published the names of 300 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons, at least some of whom are expected to be released in an exchange with Hamas in Gaza for dozens of Israeli hostages seized by the militant group on 7 October.The families of hostages held in Gaza have said they are living in a “nightmare” as they endure an agonising wait to see if their loves ones are among those freed.  The relatives of some of the 240 hostages in Gaza have said they were in the dark about who would be released and when. Meanwhile, excitement is also growing for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank that their imprisoned loved ones may also be coming home.More than 100 Palestinians in Gaza – including 50 from one family – were reported killed on Wednesday as Israeli forces continued attacking across the strip from land, sea and air. Wafa, a Palestinian news agency, said 81 people had been killed since midnight as houses were targeted in the centre of the strip. A further 60 were believed to be dead after bombing in and around the Jabaliya refugee camp in the north.The head of the UN children’s agency (Unicef) has called the Gaza Strip “the most dangerous place in the world to be a child” and said that the temporary ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is “far from enough”. Catherine Russell, addressing the UN security council on Wednesday, also said that “all children inside the territory” were facing “what could soon become a catastrophic nutrition crisis”.The number of journalists killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict since 7 October has increased to at least 53, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).  The funerals were held in Beirut on Wednesday for Al Mayadeen’s reporter Farah Omar and camera operator Rabih al Mamari who were both killed by an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday.Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement officially confirmed that five of its fighters, including the son of a senior lawmaker, have been killed, amid skirmishes at the Israel-Lebanon border, according to AFP. Abbas Raad, son of the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc Mohammed Raad, was “martyred on the road to Jerusalem”, the group said in a statement – the phrase it has been using to announce the death of its members due to Israeli fire since the war started on 7 October.Israel’s military has said it intercepted a cruise missile near the southern port city of Eilat.  Eilat is in the south of Israel at the northern tip of the Red Sea, and has previously been targeted during the conflict both by long range fire from the Gaza Strip and by Yemen’s Houthi forces.The western powers on the UN security council face a choice of either demanding Israel lift its stranglehold on humanitarian aid into Gaza or being complicit in Israeli war crimes and collective punishment, foreign ministers from Arab and Muslim countries said on a visit to London on Wednesday.Pope Francis has faced criticism for allegedly drawing equivalence between Israel and Hamas.  During a general audience after meeting with Israeli and Palestinian delegations at the Vatican, the pope reportedly remarked: “They suffer so much, I heard how they both suffer.” He went on: “Wars do this, but here we have gone beyond war: this is not war, it is terrorism.”\nEnd of Document\nNumber of Palestinians killed is ‘truly unbearable’, says Spanish PM"," November 24, 2023",2023-11-28

Organisers hope that thousands of members of the public will attend. No placards or flags are allowed at the event.\n“The hurt and pain on both sides of this [war] is so overwhelming that people are not able to acknowledge a shared sense of grief and suffering,” said Cox. “And then there are people who are willing to exploit the situation to peddle antisemitism or Islamophobia. The most extreme voices are dominating the conversation.”\nMost people feel empathy for the parents who have lost their child in Israel or Gaza, he said.\n“But a relatively small group of people on either end of the spectrum who are very vociferously supporting Israel or the Palestinian cause are dominating debate and also saying: ‘You’re either with us or against us. It’s a binary choice’.\n“And then you have a ramping-up of tension; extremists using people’s emotion and grief to power their own hatred. The risk with that – and the reason that I feel it so viscerally – is that it makes extreme people more likely to do extreme things. So the risk of attacks, whether on MPs, or members of the public, or a synagogue or a mosque, is heightened.”\nCox’s wife, the Labour MP Jo Cox, was murdered by a rightwing extremist during the Brexit referendum campaign in 2016. Cox has since campaigned for community cohesion through Together , a coalition chaired by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury.\nTogether for Humanity was the result of “very strong and very positive” responses to a post by Cox on X, formerly Twitter, asking if there was interest in “trying to draw together people who want to safeguard our shared humanity, who wants to be really clear that even if you’ve got very strong views for one side or another, it doesn’t mean the other side is evil”.\nIts first event was a small vigil in Downing Street on 17 November, at which Magen Inon, a London-based teacher whose parents were killed by Hamas on 7 October, said: “I pray that no more innocent lives are lost, for the hostages to be safely back home and for the war, all wars, to end.”\nLayla Moran, a Lib Dem MP of Palestinian heritage, spoke of her grief at hearing shortly before the vigil that a family member in Gaza had died after being unable to access hospital treatment. She added: “I feel closer to those in Israel who have also lost loved ones in this tragedy.”\nCox said that many people felt “paralysed because they’re scared they’re going to be called antisemitic or Islamophobic, or pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli, or just get it wrong in some way”. Together for Humanity aspired to become a national movement, offering support, speakers and background material to local groups that want to bridge divides, he said.\nEnd of Document\nMelissa Barrera, fired from Scream VII over Israel-Hamas posts, responds: ‘Silence is not an option’"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28

This is an increase from 320,000 in the YE June 2022. This increase is mainly attributed to dependants (from 58,000 in YE June 2022 to 96,000 in YE June 2023). The Home Office’s statistics report, Why do people come to the UK? To study , suggests that this is because of an increase in the number of visas granted to dependants from Nigeria and India.\nThe increase in the number of people coming to the UK to study in the last two years may partly be reflected in the attraction of the new Graduate visa route. This visa route allows international students to apply to work in the UK for at least two years after completing their studies.\nBut it also says that it is the increase in people coming to work is what has been driving the overall increase in non-EU immigration.\nThe increase in non-EU immigration in the YE June 2023 was mainly driven by migrants coming for work (up to 33% from 23% in YE June 2022), largely attributed to those coming on health and care visas; in contrast, those arriving on humanitarian routes decreased from 19% to 9% over the same period …\nThose immigrating long-term on work-related visas (main applicants and dependants) made up 33% of non-EU long-term immigration in the YE June 2023, with an estimated 322,000 arrivals. This is compared with 198,000 in YE June 2022. This is split fairly evenly between main applicants (169,000) and dependants (154,000).\nThe Home Office’s statistics report, Why do people come to the UK? To work , shows growth in long-term sponsored work visas following the introduction of the “Skilled Worker” and “Skilled Worker - Health and Care” visas in 2020. Health and Care work visas were the most common type of work visa that dependants came to the UK on and is driving the increase in immigration of those on work dependant visas (from 86,000 in YE June 2022 to 154,000 in YE June 2023).\nblock-time published-time 4.50pm GMT \n Badenoch tells inquiry extra funding would not have stopped ethnic minorities being disproportionately affected by Covid  \n Kemi Badenoch told the Covid inquiry additional funding would not have stopped ethnic minorities being disproportionately affected by Covid.\nThe equalities minister insisted:\nBeing an ethnic minority was not the cause of being disproportionately impacted. It correlated with what the causes were – the co-morbidities. So you have to tackle the actual cause, not the thing that comes in common with it.\nThere was no perfect way of finding a particular group to give extra cash to. And extra cash, in and of itself, would not have solved the problem which you were trying to resolve of trying to make sure people were protected and away from the virus.\nQuestioning her, Prof Leslie Thomas KC, of the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations, argued “structural inequalities” could have been one of the causes, including poverty and discrimination.\nBut Badenoch said there was no “silver bullet” to resolving such issues, noting her team had not found structural inequalities in the research they undertook.\nShe said:\nIn terms of the issues around deprivation, poverty – a lot of work was done to look at what we could do to fix that but we can’t cure diabetes, we can’t remove poverty.\nReflecting on the broader levels of financial support given during the pandemic, she said it was inevitable some people felt excluded. “There will always be people who feel that they’re on the wrong side” regardless of where the boundary was drawn on support, she said.\nReflecting on what more could have been done to mitigate the disproportionate impact of Covid on disabled people and ethnic minorities, Badenoch said “joining forces” with the disabilities minister wouldn’t have made a difference.\nShe went as far as saying it was not possible to prepare for the pandemic, or have a government response ready.\nI think just because you’re looking at things separately doesn’t mean there’s a hierarchy of needs. The evidence showed that disabled people were more impacted and we were keen to ensure that it was the people who were most impacted that got the most attention.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.03pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.42pm GMT \n Rees-Mogg suggests, if farmers can't produce fruit without foreign pickers, UK should just import it instead  \n Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary, told Radio 4’s The World at One that he was “embarrassed” as a Conservative by today’s net migration figures, which show the party is failing to keep the promise it made at the 2019 election. (See 11.33am. ) He said:\nThis is a phenomenally high level with economic consequences … I’m embarrassed that we haven’t achieved what we set out to achieve.\nRees-Mogg said the level of legal migration was a more serious problem than people crossing the Channel on small boats. “In terms of the numbers, the small boats is a distraction,” he said.\nAsked if he agreed with Suella Braverman’s call for a cap on net migration numbers (see 4.06pm  ), Rees-Mogg said that this would be one way of reducing the numbers.\nAnd when it was put to him that the UK needed to allow foreign workers to come to the country to pick fruit, he said he didn’t agree.

I don’t think that we have adapted to this age of social media where information travels at lightning speed across the world.\nI don’t know how we solve it, but in terms of gaps, I think there is a lesson in the pandemic that this is an area that needs some addressing.\nBadenoch said she has heard there is a lot of work going on in departments on the issue, but added: “I don’t see it.”\nReferring to deaths during the pandemic, Badenoch also said that, if ethnicity had been recorded on death certificates, the disproportionate impact of Covid on ethnic minority people might have come to light sooner. She said:\nOne of the recommendations I think that would have come in an earlier report was even about recording ethnicity on death certificates, which was something that we discovered was not being done and was a big issue.\nI felt that if we had had that – I don’t know why it wasn’t recorded, I don’t know if there was ever a reason, it was just something that wasn’t recorded – if we had had that, we might, not certainly, but we might have been able to spot the disproportionate impact a little bit earlier.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 4.25pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 3.19pm GMT \n     Keir Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, during their visit to Tilbury freeport in Essex.

Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to Essex, he said:\nWhichever way the government tried to spin the autumn statement, the reality is that living standards are dropping, the tax burden is going up and that disposable income at the end of this government is going to be less than it was at the beginning for ordinary working people.\nThat’s worth thinking about. That means people will have less money in their pocket at the end of this government than they had at the beginning.

But he said the party had plans to raise funds through some tax rises that it has announced, and he said Labour would champion growth.\nIf we are privileged enough to come into power, I don’t underestimate the challenges that we will face because of the 13 years of failure that we’ve already had. That will require tough choices. But we have already said where we will increase tax …\nThe underlying answer has to be about economic growth. And if you’re going to have economic growth, you need a realisable plan that’s worked with business to make it actually work.\nThe government says it wants growth, but just look at the forecast they’ve got after 13 years of near negligible growth.

He told reporters at the lobby briefing:\nNet migration remains far too high. That’s why we are taking action to bring it down. That is what the British public expect.\nThat’s why in May we announced the toughest-ever action to reduce migration. That includes clamping down on the roughly 150,000 dependants of students who come into the UK every year and introducing an additional immigration health surcharge and raising visa costs.\nWe know this is predicted to lead to significant reductions. As we’ve seen today, the ONS figures show migration is now reducing year on year [see 10.06am  ], but we believe there is much more to do.\nWhere the system is being abused, we will leave no stone unturned in rooting that out so companies and individuals cannot exploit our system.\nAsked why the government did not just issue fewer visas, the spokesperson said it was important to “strike the right balance” and that it was necessary to allow foreign workers in to address “short-term pressures” in areas, such as health and social care. He went on:\nIt is important that we take the time to consider carefully how we approach this, given the importance that a number of migrants can contribute – whether that’s to our health and care sector, or elsewhere to the wider economy.\nWe do believe there is further to go here and that’s why we’re keeping it under review.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.06pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 12.48pm GMT \nIn its own report  on the autumn statement, the Resolution Foundation thinktank says this will be the first parliament on record in which household incomes in real terms will be lower at the end than at the beginning.

But, if all tax and benefit measures from April 2019 are included, the poorest 10% of households have gained most.\n(In fact, the poorest 10% of households are the only group that have gained overall. But the changes have been progressive, in that wealthier households have lost out more – both proportionally and in cash terms – than poorer ones.)\n    Distributional impact of autumn statement Photograph: IFS      \nblock-time published-time 12.20pm GMT \n Hunt's tax cuts give back less than 25p for every £1 taken by Treasury in increased taxes since 2021, IFS says  \nTurning back to the Institute for Fiscal Studies ’ assessment of the autumn statement , it says that Jeremy Hunt’s tax cuts yesterday return less than £1 to taxpayers for every extra £4 they are paying because of tax rises since 2021.\nAnother way of putting that would be to say that, for every £1 the Treasury has taken, less than 25p is coming back under yesterday’s measures.\nThis is from the analysis by the IFS’s Robert Joyce.\nThe headline measures in this autumn statement were cuts to the rates of national insurance contributions for employees and the self-employed. Taken in isolation, these put money back into the pockets of almost 30 million workers at a cost of around £10 billion per year, with anyone earning at least £12,570, or making profits of at least £6,725, per year benefitting.\nThe bigger picture is that these changes give back less than £1 of every £4 that is being taken away from households through changes to NICs and income tax announced since March 2021. Those takeaways are far less transparent than the smaller giveaway announced today - implemented as they are through multi-year freezes to income tax and NICs thresholds, which gradually bring more and more people into higher tax brackets, and especially so at a time of high inflation.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.21pm GMT\nblock-time published-time 11.58am GMT \n Labour says Cameron should reveal more details of his role in China-linked port project in Sri Lanka  \nLabour wants David Cameron to reveal the extent of his links to a Chinese-backed enterprise, PA Media reports.

The New Conservatives say this must happen by the next election, which must be held by January 2025 at the latest.\nThey say:\nFor the Treasury, there may be reasonable arguments for increasing immigration – because more people translates into more recorded economic activity – but the truth is the public won’t accept it. Our voters can tell the difference between real economic growth that improves the standard of living for ordinary households, and the phantom ‘growth’ that importing ever more people puts on a Treasury spreadsheet.\nHigh rates of immigration depress wages, reduce investment in skills and technology, put unsustainable pressure on housing and public services, and threaten community cohesion.\nThe word ‘existential’ has been used a lot in recent days but this really is ‘do or die’ for our party. Each of us made a promise to the electorate. We don’t believe that such promises can be ignored.\nThe government must propose, today, a comprehensive package of measures to meet the manifesto promise by the time of the next election. We will assess any such package and report publicly on whether it will meet the promise made to the electorate.\nThe New Conservatives include prominent supporters of Suella Braverman, the former home secretary who has herself criticised Sunak for not doing enough to bring down immigration.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.52am GMT\nblock-time published-time 11.22am GMT \n     Jeremy Hunt, centre, on a visit to the Airbus factory in Broughton, north Wales, this morning.

In his summary , Paul Johnson, the IFS director, says Jeremy Hunt’s tax cuts are “paid for by planned real cuts in public service spending” which are not credible. He says this means Hunt has left a huge problem for whoever is chancellor after the next election. He explains:\nThe net result is that Mr Hunt is, by the narrowest of tiny margins, still on course to meet his (poorly designed) fiscal rule that debt as a fraction of national income should be falling in the last year of the forecast period. In reality debt is set to be just about flat at around 93 per cent of national income over the whole period. And that is on the basis of a series of questionable, if not plain implausible, assumptions. It assumes that many aspects of day to day public service spending will be cut. It assumes a substantial real cut in public investment spending. It assumes that rates of fuel duties will rise year on year with inflation – which they have not done in more than a decade and they surely will not do next April. It assumes that the constant roll over of “temporary” business rates cuts will stop. It assumes, of course, that the economy doesn’t suffer any negative shocks.\nLike his predecessors Mr Hunt has taken a modest improvement in the public finance forecasts and spent most of it. He has spent up front and told us he will meet his targets largely by unspecified fiscal restraint at some point in the future. What he will do in March if the OBR downgrades its forecasts we do not know. Any such downgrading would leave him with a big headache. More importantly he or his successor is going to have the mother and father of a headache when it comes to making the tough decisions implied by this statement in a year or two’s time.\nAnd here is Johnson’s conclusion.\nThe fiscal forecasts have not in any real sense got better. Debt is not declining over time. Taxes are still heading to record levels. Spending is also due to stay high by historic standards, not least because of high debt interest payments. But those payments plus pressures on health and pension spending mean current plans are for some pretty serious cuts across other areas of public spending. How did Mr Hunt afford tax cuts when real economic forecasts got no better? He banked additional revenue from higher inflation, and pencilled in harsher cuts to public spending.\nI’m not sure I’d want to be the chancellor inheriting this fiscal situation in a year’s time.\n     Paul Johnson.

(See 9.33am. )\nHere is an extract from the ONS’s summary. It puts the latest annual net migration figure at 672,000, but says provisional figures suggest this is starting to fall from a record high. That would be due to immigration falling and emigration rising, it says.\nThe provisional estimate of total long-term immigration for year ending (YE) June 2023 was 1.2 million, while emigration was 508,000, meaning that net migration was 672,000; most people arriving to the UK in the YE June 2023 were non-EU nationals (968,000), followed by EU (129,000) and British (84,000).\nNet migration for YE June 2023 was 672,000, which is slightly higher compared with YE June 2022 (607,000) but down on our updated estimate for YE December 2022 (745,000); while it is too early to say if this is the start of a new downward trend, these more recent estimates indicate a slowing of immigration coupled with increasing emigration.\nMethods for measuring international migration are in development, and these timely estimates for year ending June 2023 and December 2022 are provisional, supported by assumptions that are informed by past behaviour; this means the uncertainty associated with these estimates will reduce in our next releases, when we have more data to confirm people’s long-term migration status.\nBefore the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, migration was relatively stable, but patterns and behaviours have been shifting considerably since then; net migration increased sharply since 2021 because of a rise in non-EU immigration driven by a range of factors including those arriving on humanitarian routes (including Ukrainian and British national (overseas) schemes), as well as an increase in non-EU students and workers.\nAnd here is a table from the report.\n    Net migration figures Photograph: ONS    \nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 10.07am GMT\nblock-time published-time 9.44am GMT \n Hunt says he feels 'incredibly guilty' after autumn statement - because he did not buy his wife birthday present or even card  \n Jeremy Hunt does not seem to have any qualms about the Conservative party misleadingly saying taxes are going down, when the tax burden is going up.

He told LBC this morning that, despite starting his autumn statement speech with a reference to it being his wife’s birthday, he did not get round to buying her a present – or even a card. He said:\nI’m afraid I have not bought anything for my wife. I didn’t even get her a birthday card.

Most experts think they are unrealistic because they think in practice a future chancellor will have to spend more to stop public services collapsing.\nIn an interview with Times Radio, Hunt defended his spending plans. “We do need to be disciplined in public spending in the short run,” he said. But he claimed that this approach was necessary to stimulate growth.\nAnd when it was put to him that his spending plans would lead to public services getting worse, he said he did not accept that. He explained:\nNo, and the reason is very straightforward. If we want to have money to invest in the NHS, in schools, in our armed forces over the longer term, you have to grow the economy.\nThat is the only way in the longer run that you can fund the cost of an ageing population and that’s why I took those decisions for the long term.\nIn the short run, I am showing discipline with public spending. I think that is the right thing to do.

The thinktank has now published its analysis of the autumn statement  and its title is: “A pre-election Statement”. Here is a summary from Torsten Bell, the RF’s chief executive.\nJeremy Hunt yesterday got his pre-election giveaways in early, with an autumn statement offering tax cuts today, at the price of implausible spending cuts tomorrow. Well-targeted specifics, addressing problems such as our tax system’s bias against working-age earnings or benefit system’s failure to keep pace with fast-rising rents, were juxtaposed with far less well-designed big picture fiscal choices. Tax-cutting rhetoric clashed with tax-rising reality, and positive steps to encourage business investment combined with a growth-sapping hit to public investment.\nUltimately this reflects the pressures, not only of an upcoming election, but of governing a sicker, older, slower-growing Britain, amidst an era of far higher interest rates.\nThat might be difficult for policy makers, but it’s a disaster for households whose wages are stuck in a totally unprecedented 20-year stagnation. This parliament is set to achieve a truly grim new record: the first in which household incomes will be lower at its end than its beginning.\nThe thinktank says the fall in the value of real household incomes over the course of this parliament will work out at £1,900 on average in real terms. It says:\nThe biggest inflation shock in four decades, and taxes rising to their highest level in eight decades, means the outlook for living standards remains dire. Real household disposable income per person is expected to fall by 1.5 per cent in 2024 – presenting a bleak economic backdrop to the 2024 election. The last time RHDI fell in an election year was 50 years ago, in 1974. This helps drive a new grim record on living standards: this parliament is on track to be the first in which real household disposable incomes actually fall (by 3.1 per cent from December 2019 to January 2025): households will, on average, be £1,900 poorer at the end of this parliament than at its start.\nThe RF also says that around 40% of the gains from the tax and benefit measures announced yesterday will go to the richest fifth of the population.

The tax cuts in Jeremy Hunt ’s autumn statement yesterday were larger than expected and, unusually, the national insurance cut will take effect from January, not April, when tax cuts or tax rises are normally implemented. Inevitably, that prompted speculation at Westminster  that Hunt was preparing for an early election.\nBut in an interview this morning Hunt claimed it was “silly” to view his tax cuts as a pre-election giveaway. He told Sky News:\nWe haven’t chosen the most populist tax cuts. I think it’s silly to think about this in terms of the timing of the next election.\nWe’re trying to make the right decisions for the long-term growth of the British economy.\nenltr'Silly' to think of autumn statement in terms of election timing says Chancellor Jeremy Hunt https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3 ??

The actor said that she condemned antisemitism and Islamophobia but would “continue to speak out” on the Israel-Hamas conflict.\nBarrera, who starred in the fifth and sixth Scream films and was set to star in the forthcoming seventh instalment, has been outspoken in support of Palestine on social media, where she has described Israel as committing “genocide” and “brutally killing innocent Palestinians, mothers and children, under the pretence of destroying Hamas”.\n“Western media only shows the [Israeli] side. Why do they do that, I will let you deduce for yourself,” she wrote on 22 October, adding: “We don’t need more hate. No Islamophobia. No antisemitism.”\nOn Tuesday, Barrera was fired from Scream VII by production company Spyglass Media, who confirmed to Variety  that the decision was due to some of her social media posts, which were interpreted as antisemitic.\n“We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech,” a Spyglass spokesperson told Variety. The Guardian has not confirmed which posts Spyglass was referring to.\nIn a since-deleted post to X on Tuesday, Scream VII director Christopher Landon wrote: “This is my statement: Everything sucks. Stop yelling. This was not my decision to make.”\nOn Wednesday, Barrera issued a statement on Instagram stories. “First and foremost I condemn antisemitism and Islamophobia. I condemn hate and prejudice of any kind against any group of people.\n“As a Latina, a proud Mexicana, I feel the responsibility of having a platform that allows me the privilege of being heard, and therefore I have tried to use it to raise awareness about issues I care about and to lend my voice to those in need,” she continued.\n“Every person on this earth … deserves equal human rights, dignity and, of course, freedom. I believe a group of people are NOT their leadership, and that no governing body should be above criticism.\n“I pray day and night for no more deaths, for no more violence, and for peaceful co-existence. I will continue to speak out for those that need it most and continue to advocate for peace and safety, for human rights and freedom. Silence is not an option for me.”\nScream VII was thrown into further disarray on Wednesday when Barrera’s co-star Jenna Ortega reportedly pulled out of the film  due to a scheduling conflict with the second season of Netflix show Wednesday. Ortega and Barrera both starred in the previous two Scream films as sisters Tara and Sam Carpenter.\nBarrera is the latest person in Hollywood to come under fire for posts and actions in relation to the war between Israel and Hamas.\nOn Tuesday, Susan Sarandon was dropped from Hollywood talent agency UTA  after speaking at a pro-Palestine rally. The Oscar-winning actor drew criticism for saying: “There are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country.”\nAnd last month, Maha Dakhil, the co-head of film at Hollywood agency CAA, resigned from the agency’s board after a backlash to her shared Instagram posts that read, in part: “What’s more heartbreaking than witnessing genocide? Witnessing the denial that genocide is happening.” Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin subsequently announced  he was leaving CAA, saying “Maha isn’t an antisemite, she’s just wrong.”\nDakhil later issued a public apology.  “I made a mistake with a repost in my Instagram, which used hurtful language,” she said. “I’m sorry for the pain I have caused.”\nEnd of Document\nAfternoon Update: Bruce Lehrmann testifies in defamation lawsuit; Israel-Hamas ceasefire delayed; and Christmas gifts under $50"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28
"No 10 accuses FA of ‘equivocating’ on terrorism by opting to stop lighting arch","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-23 10:58:00," FOOTBALL; Version:2",432," Paul MacInnes"," FA to continue supporting campaigns and causes in other waysFailure to light Wembley arch in Israel colours was criticised","\nDowning Street has accused the Football Association of equivocating over terrorism, as it criticised the decision to scale back the use of the Wembley arch for sending messages of solidarity.\nThe FA decided this week to restrict the occasions on which the arch on the national stadium is illuminated after the controversial decision to acknowledge the Hamas assault on Israel with only a minute’s silence.\nAsked about the move on Thursday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson was highly critical. “There should be no room for equivocation when it comes to terrorism,” they said. “It’s right to stand by those affected and we were disappointed that they chose not to light it up in response to the attack in Israel.”\nThe FA has concluded that Wembley should be illuminated only for sporting and entertainment purposes, after its board reflected on its policy. Speaking last month, the FA’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said he “recognised the hurt”  to the Jewish community caused by the decision to leave the arch unlit during England men’s friendly against Australia in the week after the Hamas attack.\nFA sources insist that the change in policy will not lead to the organisation stepping back from supporting a range of campaigns and causes, and the possibility of the arch being lit as an act of solidarity has not been ruled out. But there has been a reversal of the approach that meant the arch was lit for a number of causes over recent years.\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year the arch was illuminated in the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag, and it displayed the colours of the French tricolour after the terror attacks in Paris in 2015. It has also been lit to support International Women’s Day and displayed the rainbow colours of the LGBTQI+ flag last year, after Fifa’s decision to ban England players from wearing rainbow armbands  at the World Cup.\nIn the week of the 7 October attacks the FA came under pressure to light the arch in the colours of the flag of Israel. It opted instead for a period of silence to honour those who died in the attacks and the Palestinian victims of Israel’s subsequent offensive. At the time, the government’s adviser on antisemitism, John Mann, said the decision showed that “Jews don’t count” and argued that the FA appeared out of its depth. “By saying it wants to avoid politics football has ended up playing politics,” he said.\nThe FA appears to have acknowledged that criticism in its new policy and by emphasising privately that Wembley is, primarily, a sport and entertainment venue, rather than a national monument.\nEnd of Document\nFirst Thing: Dutch election results put Geert Wilders’ far-right party in lead"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28
"Number of Palestinians killed is ‘truly unbearable’, says Spanish PM","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-23 11:08:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:2",757," Sam Jones"," Pedro Sánchez says all civilians must be protected in Israel-Hamas war and reiterates call for two-state solutionIsrael-Hamas war – live updates","\nSpain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has urged Israel to rethink its offensive in Gaza, telling its president and prime minister the number of dead Palestinians is “truly unbearable”, and that the response to Hamas’s terrorist attacks last month cannot include “the deaths of innocent civilians, including thousands of children”.\nSánchez’s blunt pleas came during a visit to the Middle East with the Belgian prime minister, Alexander de Croo, during which he called for a peace conference and reiterated that the creation of a Palestinian state remained the best way to bring peace and security to the region.\nIsrael says 1,200 people were killed and 239 taken hostage when Hamas fighters crossed the border from Gaza on 7 October. According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, more than 14,100 people have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory strikes.\nSpeaking as he met Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday afternoon, Sánchez said Spain had repeatedly condemned Hamas’s “shocking acts of terrorism” and acknowledged Israel’s right to defend itself.\nBut he added: “Let me also be clear: Israel must abide by international law, including international humanitarian law, in its response … The whole world is shocked at the images that we see coming from Gaza every day. The number of Palestinians killed is truly unbearable. I believe that all civilians must be protected at all costs.”\nSánchez said “a serious and credible prospect for peace” was more necessary than ever. “Without a political settlement, we are bound to run again into a never-ending cycle of violence.”\nEarlier, the Spanish prime minister had made a similar request of Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, once again stressing Israel’s obligation to follow international humanitarian law.\n“Israel, as we’ve said since the beginning of these terrible attacks, has the right to defend itself,” he said. “But it must also comply with international law, including international humanitarian law. The response cannot imply the deaths of innocent civilians in Gaza, including thousands of children. We need to urgently stop the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.”\nSánchez added that a comprehensive solution needed to be found that included “the establishment of a viable Palestinian state”.\nSánchez said the Palestinian authorities should take control of Gaza when the war ended. “The two-state solution should be implemented to defeat terrorism and guarantee Israel’s security,” he said.\nHe called for an international peace conference to be held as soon as possible, adding: “We need to achieve the establishment of a viable Palestinian state. Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in peace and security.”\nSánchez and De Croo were expected to meet the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Thursday afternoon, before travelling to Egypt for talks with President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.\nSpain, which currently holds the EU presidency, has already said it is ready to hold a peace conference on the conflict. On Thursday, the country’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, told state radio RNE: “The definitive solution is the existence of a Palestinian state that guarantees Israel’s security.” He said Spain was “in favour of recognising” a Palestinian state.\nRelations between Spain and Israel have been fraught over recent weeks  after some far-left members of Sánchez’s previous cabinet criticised Israel’s reaction to the terrorist atrocities, suggesting it was committing war crimes in Gaza and calling for Netanyahu to be brought before the international criminal court.\nIsrael’s embassy in Madrid described the remarks as “deeply immoral” and accused some Spanish MPs of aligning themselves with “Isis-style terrorism”.\nSpain responded with its own strongly worded statement that accused the Israeli embassy of “spreading falsehoods” about some cabinet members.\n“In a full democracy, such as Spain, any political leader can freely express their positions as the representative of a political party,” the statement from the foreign ministry said.\n“In any case, the Spanish government’s position on the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas is clear: unequivocal condemnation; demands for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages, and the recognition of Israel to defend itself within the limits set by international law and international humanitarian law.”\nSpain’s stated desire to recognise a Palestinian state would follow similar official recognition from Sweden, Iceland, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Slovakia, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Romania.\nEnd of Document\nGaza ceasefire to begin on Friday morning with hostage releases to follow"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28
"There’s a big reason Joe Biden is losing younger voters: Israel and Palestine","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-23 11:09:00," OPINION; Version:1",1242," Moira Donegan"," The US president’s hawkish support for Israel has alienated younger voters, progressives, and Arab and Muslim Americans","\nThe 2024 presidential contest should not be close. Joe Biden’s opponent, Donald Trump, is a bigot, a liar and a crook, with dozens of credible sexual assault allegations, a disastrous track record of enabling sadistic racism in both his policy and his rhetoric, a frank admission of his own authoritarian ambitions, and 92 pending felony charges.\nThe Republican party that the former president leads has become beholden to a small but extremely powerful base of voters with wildly unpopular social views, particularly regarding abortion – views that have driven the Republicans to election losses in virtually all major contests since the summer of 2022. Voters hate them, and reject their vision for the US; few politicians have ever been so unpopular as Trump is, and few political platforms have ever seemed so determined to alienate and anger voters as the Republican party’s.\nYet Joe Biden could lose. If the election were held today, it’s likely that he would. Much was made of a New York Times/Siena poll , published earlier this month, that showed the US president losing to Trump in five key swing states. The Biden campaign largely downplayed the numbers, shrugging that the election is far away.\nNow, a new NBC poll also shows Biden in dire straits, with his approval rating falling to the lowest it has ever been: 40%. The poll found that he was faring especially poorly with Democrats and young voters, large numbers of whom are dissatisfied with his handling of an issue that is exposing a growing divide within the party: Israel’s assault on Palestinians in Gaza following the October 7 Hamas attack. \nFrom nearly the first moments of Israel’s war, the Biden administration has staunchly supported its Middle East ally, and allowed little public daylight between their own official statements and those of Israel’s rightwing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The aid and arms deals continue to flow to Israel unconditioned, even as Israeli bombings have now killed more than 14,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including more than 5,000 children and displaced upwards of a million people.\nThe hawkish support for Israel’s war has been intense, with rhetoric from the White House often appearing indifferent or outright hostile to concerns about the deaths of Palestinian civilians. On 10 October, Biden’s press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre  described calls for a ceasefire as “wrong”, “repugnant” and “disgraceful”. “There are not two sides here,” Jean-Pierre said, signaling that the White House would not brook any concern for Palestinian lives.\nIn an especially disturbing moment, Biden himself cast doubt on the official death toll from the Gaza health ministry – saying on 27 October that he had “ no confidence  in the number the Palestinians are using” – even though figures from this agency have been previously deemed reliable  by the United Nations and international human rights agencies. The implication seemed to be that the Palestinians were cynically overstating the number of their dead, and that the real number was some smaller, supposedly more acceptable figure.\nSince he made that comment, the Palestinian casualties in Gaza are said to have nearly doubled. It’s unclear whether Biden believes it.\nAs the corpses pile up and Gaza’s buildings tumble down, the Biden administration has seemed to hedge on this unqualified pro-Israel, pro-war stance, at least at the margins. People identified as “administration officials” have given off-the-record quotes expressing “ frustration  ” and “ concern  ” with the Israelis’ determination to press forward with a Gaza invasion without any long-term plan for the region. Asked if the Israelis were making any real effort to minimize civilian casualties, the US national security council spokesman, John Kirby, said: “We have seen some indications that there are efforts being applied in certain situations to try to minimize, but I don’t want to overstate that.”\nAlon Pinkas of Haaretz interpreted  those remarks as a signal of a growing distaste for the Israeli operation within the Biden US security state. This is what amounts to distancing from the Biden administration when it comes to Israel’s operation in Gaza: hedged off-the-record statements about long-term strategy, and a single response to a question of whether Israel is acting as if it cares about preserving innocent Palestinian lives that amounts to a coded and heavily euphemistic “no”.\nThat’s the official line. But there are growing indications that the Democratic party is heading for a revolt over the issue. Young voters are not the only ones who are angry. Arab and Muslim American voters are voicing outrage at Biden’s stance, endangering his re-election prospects nationwide but especially in the crucial battleground state of Michigan , which is home to a large Muslim American voting bloc.\nEven within the party bureaucracy itself, there are signs of trouble. The state department has fielded an unusual number of internal complaint memos  about US policy over the issue; large numbers of Democratic congressional staffers  joined a Washington DC protest calling for a ceasefire.\nThe House voted to censure  representative Rashida Tlaib, of Michigan, the only Palestinian American in Congress, over her calls for Palestinian liberation – particularly her use of the phrase “from the river to the sea”, which Tlaib explained was a call for peace, freedom, dignity and equality for all in the region, but which her detractors alleged was an antisemitic call for Jewish elimination. (Such has been the nature of much of the debate around the conflict in the halls of US power: arguments over rhetoric have frequently distracted from substantive issues of policy.)\nBut that did not stop  a growing number of her fellow Democratic members of Congress from joining her in calls for a ceasefire. The White House may be calling them “repugnant”, but the pro-ceasefire camp in Congress looks more and more like the future of the Democratic party: it is younger, it is further to the left, and it is majority non-white.\nHandwringing about Biden’s age and its relevance is overstated. But few issues have done more to highlight the problem of gerontocracy within the Democratic party, and of the growing generational gap in US politics, than this internal dispute over Israel-Palestine. In a way, the divide between Biden and his loyalists on the one hand, and the pro-ceasefire left and Democratic base on the other, might be a matter of historical references.\nBiden comes from a generation that came of age much closer in time to the Holocaust; he is in that sense perhaps more acutely aware of Jewish vulnerability – and certainly more convinced that Zionism’s nationalist project can mitigate it – than younger people are. The younger staffers, state department functionaries, members of Congress, and voters, meanwhile, are not thinking of the second world War, but of the war on terror; of September 11, and the disastrous, brutal and ultimately futile wars of revenge that the US fought in its aftermath.\nEach side is proceeding from what they feel are the definitive lessons of their era – the 20th century for Biden, and the 21st century for the pro-ceasefire camp. The results of the next election may well depend on whether they can find each other in time. \n                                                               Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist                                                         \nEnd of Document\nDavid Cameron expresses hopes over temporary truce during visit to Israel"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28

The liberal-conservative Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), led by the outgoing justice minister, Dilan Yesilgöz-Zegerius, got 24 seats.\nThe French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whose National Rally party is the biggest single opposition party in the French parliament, congratulated Wilders.\n                                                                                        What did Le Pen say? She described Wilders’ Party for Freedom (PVV) as an ally with her party in the European parliament, saying his election performance showed that “more and more countries at the heart of the EU are contesting the way it works... and want us to master immigration, which is seen by many European peoples as massive and totally anarchic today”.

Energy companies still investing too much in fossil fuels, global watchdog says                                      \nEnergy companies are investing twice as much in oil and gas as they should be if the world hopes to limit rising global temperatures to avert a climate catastrophe, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). \nThe world’s energy watchdog said the sector still had “minimal” engagement with the global clean energy transition, and continued to contribute just 1% of clean energy investment globally.\nIn a special report before the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai, which begins on 30 November, the agency called on the industry to show commitment to tackling pollution by balancing its investments in clean energy and fossil fuels.\nThe IEA executive director, Fatih Birol, said the industry faced “a moment of truth” in which it must “make profound decisions” about its role.\n                                                                                        What else did Birol say? “With the world suffering the impacts of a worsening climate crisis, continuing with business as usual is neither socially nor environmentally responsible,” he said.

After a pause from late afternoon on Wednesday, rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza at 5am this morning.\n                                                                                        Is the deal still on track?

Turkules, who was named by a local man, first took up residence in West Orange, 25 miles west of New York City, over the summer. The bird’s fearless attitude towards traffic and disregard for authority soon made him a local celebrity. Despite sometimes causing mile-long traffic jams, his popularity was such that on Saturday businesses organized a “Hometown Hero” event in Turkules’s honor. But after a weeks-long effort, Turkules has now been captured and relocated to Wharton state forest, 85 miles away, leaving the town bereft.\n                                        Or this: ‘It’s not a public service, it’s toxic’ – welcome to the world of gossip surveillance                                      \nTikTokers are sharing strangers’ conversations, hoping to expose gossipers to the very people they’re talking about.

Haq, who was suspended  after a post on social media about Israel’s war with Hamas led him to be accused of antisemitism this month, said that his decision to step down was “the best course of action for the FA and myself” and reiterated that his comments were not aimed at the Jewish community.\nThe resignation has come before the conclusion of an investigation into the post. Haq, who joined the FA as a BAME Football Communities representative in 2019, had already been sacked by the Lawn Tennis Association as an independent councillor. He is being investigated by England Golf, where he holds a role similar to that at the FA.\nThe controversy was sparked by Haq, who had previously left a position on the FA’s Inclusion Advisory Board, posting on X: “Netanyahu has sacrificed his own people to maintain power…whilst #Palestinians are trying to maintain their sanity. Adolf Hitler would be proud of Benjamin Netanyahu.”\nThe FA initially said that Haq had deleted the post and apologised for causing offence. But Lord Wolfson, who chairs the FA’s Football Regulatory Committee, called for a stronger response. English football’s governing body soon launched an investigation and called the post “unacceptable” and “highly offensive”.\nHaq was suspended two days later, with the FA saying his future depended on the outcome of an investigation. Haq wrote to the FA’s chair, Debbie Hewitt, on Thursday to offer his resignation.\n“It is with great sadness that I inform you of my decision to resign as a member of The FA Council with immediate effect,” Haq wrote. “I have determined this is the best course of action for the Football Association and myself.\n“As someone who has worked closely with many Jewish people over the years and created meaningful and valued friendships, the most painful part of this process is knowing that some of those friends and colleagues may not forgive me for the misunderstanding and hurt I have unintentionally caused. I take full responsibility and reiterate my apology to them and all those affected.\n“My comment was a direct criticism of a politician, not about a race or a religious group. In expressing those feelings, I chose the wrong words entirely and that has impacted the leadership position that I hold at the FA.”\nHaq added that he would be meeting members of the Jewish community to “share and understand”. He offered to help the FA set up a “systematic process in which we can bring communities together in the future”.\nThe FA faced criticism after refusing to light the Wembley arch in the colours of the Israeli flag after the attack by Hamas on 7 October. It has since decided that the arch will no longer be lit  for social causes and to show solidarity after terrorist attacks and natural disasters.\nEnd of Document\nAdviser warns UK government against tightening laws on glorifying terrorism"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28

It said that al-Shifa “under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control centre” and that Hamas fighters had sought refuge in the hospital.\nAbu Salmiya was regularly interviewed as Israeli forces attacked Gaza after 7 October, describing a desperately overcrowded facility housing 650 patients and sheltering another 5,000. He described allegations that al-Shifa sat above a Hamas command centre as untrue. \nAl-Shifa, the largest medical facility in Gaza, was surrounded and raided by Israeli forces over a week ago. Israel has repeatedly claimed that Hamas ran a command and control centre from tunnels running near and under the hospital, although so far the evidence presented has fallen short of that. \nThe IDF took a group of journalists to visit the tunnels on Wednesday, and video reports  appeared showing lengthy tunnels reinforced with concrete blocks. A bathroom and an empty tiled room with electric sockets could be seen on the footage , although its purpose could not be discerned from the filmed material.\nDaniel Hagari, the IDF’s spokesperson, said on Wednesday evening the footage showed that “Hamas built tunnels underneath hospitals, used them to command their operations”, and accused the group of “using the protected status of the hospitals as a shield”.\nPatients and civilians have since been gradually evacuated from al-Shifa including the hospital’s boss on Thursday, a day in which intense fighting continued unabated across Gaza as the planned truce was delayed by nearly 24 hours. Qatar said on Thursday that the truce would start at 7am local time (5am GMT) on Friday.\nThe Palestinian Wafa news agency reported that dozens had been killed in Israeli bombing raids in Nuseirat and its camp in the central Gaza Strip, and in Jabaliya in the north, which has been the scene of days of heavy fighting on the ground. Among those reported killed in Nuseirat was a photojournalist, Mohammad Moin Ayyash, and his family.\nIsrael’s air force said in the early morning that it bombed 300 targets over the past 24 hours, while the IDF said ground forces were fighting against Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip using tanks and drones. The military released fresh bodycam footage showing soldiers operating among rubble and destroyed buildings in the Shati quarter of Gaza City.\nA second hospital in northern Gaza, the Indonesia hospital, has now been evacuated at the insistence of Israel’s military, according to the Indonesian charity Medical Emergency Rescue Committee (MER-C), which helped fund and build it. Gaza’s health ministry said the evacuation meant that 65 bodies at the facility remained unburied.\nHamas has agreed to exchange at least 50 mostly Israeli hostages it holds, in return for a four-day pause in fighting and the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.  The truce could be extended if more prisoners are released by Hamas, but Israeli leaders insist fighting will eventually restart. \nOn Thursday, Herzi Halevi, the IDF’s chief of staff, visited brigade commanders inside Gaza and insisted the war would continue. “We are not ending the war. We will continue until we are victorious, going forward and continuing in other Hamas areas,” he said.\nEnd of Document\nMelbourne school students defy education minister and strike in support of Palestine"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28

The first set of civilians held captive by Hamas are expected to be freed at about 4pm local time on Friday, including 13 women and children.\nThe Israeli prime minister told the new UK foreign secretary that the precondition for peace in the Middle East was the eradication of what Netanyahu called the “genocidal terrorist cult” Hamas. His remarks gave the impression that Netanyahu is not currently interested in anything but a military solution to the future of Israel’s security.\nCameron’s visit to Jerusalem and Ramallah, the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, came on another dramatic day surrounding the release of hostages, and Palestinian political prisoners.\nThe UK foreign secretary was determined to visit Israel a little more than a week into his new job to show his solidarity with the country over the Hamas terrorist attack.\nHe visited the Be’eri kibbutz, scene of some of the worst violence during the Hamas assault of 7 October, during which 1,200 people were killed and 240 hostages taken, saying: “There is never any excuse for this sort of hostage-taking.\n“All the hostages should be released, but I hope that everyone who is responsible and behind this agreement can make it happen, to bring relief to those families, including, of course, there are British nationals who have been taken hostage.”\nMore than 130 people were killed in the kibbutz, which is only 8 miles (13km) from the Gaza border.\nNetanyahu insisted Israel would press on with its plans to destroy Hamas, saying: “We’ll continue with our war aims, namely to eradicate Hamas, because Hamas has already promised that they will do this again and again and again. They’re a genocidal terrorist cult. There’s no hope for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, between Israel and the Arab states, if we don’t eradicate this murderous movement that threatens the future of all of us.”\nIt is understood Cameron discussed the impact of the conflict on civilians and the need to take all possible measures to minimise civilian casualties, and urged the Israelis to take action to end settler violence in the West Bank. The UK foreign secretary highlighted the need to use the Kerem Shalom border crossing to scale up scanning and inspections to get more trucks in to Gaza.\nIn London, John Casson, Cameron’s former chief foreign policy adviser in Downing Street, criticised Netanyahu’s strategy, saying it was teaching hatred of Israel among Palestinians. He also called for a change to the ageing leadership of the Palestinian Authority.\nIn his main critique, he argued it was right to say “we stand with Israelis and say ‘never again’ to facing the terrorist horror of the last month – that is not the same as to say we endorse and enable what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his partners are saying and doing because the two things are at odds.\n“The current approach is not making the Israelis safe and secure for the long term but creating a traumatised generation of Palestinians and teaching them that Israel is their enemy and it is undermining the prospects of a two-state solution and deliberately dismantling it.”\nSpain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, also visited Israel  on Thursday, telling Netanyahu and Herzog that the number of dead Palestinians was “truly unbearable”, and that the response to Hamas’s terrorist attacks last month cannot include “the deaths of innocent civilians, including thousands of children”.\nEnd of Document\nIsrael arrests Gaza hospital director and bombs 300 targets amid truce delay"," November 23, 2023",2023-11-28

Anyone can fall victim to these scams.                     \nAfca is receiving about 1,000 scam cases a month, with 6,048 across the 2022–23 financial year, a 46% increase on the previous year.\nIn the first quarter of the new 2023–24 financial year, it received 2,856 scam-related complaints, up 57% from 1,819 in the previous three months and 125% higher than the same period a year earlier. The sums lost in these cases can exceed $1 million.\nOther initiatives such as greater sharing of real-time intelligence, delays and friction in the banking system to frustrate fraud and restrictions on high-risk transfers, are also welcome, he said.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.04am GMT\nblock-time published-time 5.38am GMT \n ‘Blank cheque’, a licence to print money, or somewhere in between? \nEnergy ministers are currently meeting in Perth, with the expanded capacity investment scheme  high on the agenda (along with perhaps 17 other items).\nWe discussed some of the outstanding issues of Chris Bowen ’s grand new plan to set auctions up to drive 32 gigawatts of new solar, wind and storage projects into the grid here:\n Related:  Chris Bowen’s plan is a shot in the arm for clean energy – but a lot has to go right to avoid future blackouts\nJust how state-owned entities (including Snowy Hydro ) will work with or against private firms remains to be seen, as will be the carrots the federal government can lay out to get states like New South Wales to clear planning delays.\nCertain media outlets said taxpayers could be up for billions of dollars, while opposition spokesperson Ted O’Brien said Bowen had written a “blank cheque” on the taxpayers’ behalf.\nTo be fair, the cost is still to be determined, so it is “blank” in that sense. However, the way tenders will work – including setting a ceiling and a floor price – could turn the scheme into an earner for the government.\nThe ACT pioneered so-called reverse auctions in Australia. The present average price is $86.52 a megawatt-hour, with the average to fall to $81.58/MWh when the Goyder windfarm begins operations in April 2024, the government told Guardian Australia.\nDuring periods of relatively low wholesale power prices, the ACT forks out money. When prices exceed a certain point, they receive revenue.\nThe latter is the present condition, with the ACT to distribute $68.5m to consumers this fiscal year. A typical household consuming 6,500 kilowatt-hours a year will get a (pre-GST) rebate of about $148. A business customer consuming 25,000 kWh a year can expect a rebate of about $570 (excluding GST).\nSo, it all hinges on the tender price and the range of the “collar” between the floor and the ceiling.\nDevelopers, though, enjoy more certainty and hence, can raise funds more cheaply and bid at lower prices.

No political objective should ever come before the security of our country and the integrity of the operations and agencies that protect us every day.\nWhether it’s the conflict in the Middle East, tensions at home, Operation Sovereign Borders or even the highly sensitive security operations involved in individuals returning from conflict, there’s nothing Peter Dutton won’t use for his own political ends.\nPeter Dutton is a reckless politician who will do and say anything to score political points – even if it puts the national security of Australians at risk.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.22am GMT\nblock-time published-time 4.48am GMT \n Virgin Australia to increase Boeing 737 Max 8 fleet \n Virgin Australia has ordered an extra six Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, on top of eight it was already due to receive, as the airline continues to anchor its growth on fuel efficient fleet.\nVirgin made the announcement as it took delivery of its third Max 8 in Brisbane on Friday, with the remaining 11 on order expected next year. Delivery will be staggered at approximately one aircraft per month in 2024.\nThe new Max 8s will enter domestic and the few short-haul international routes that Virgin has resumed – including Fiji, Bali and Samoa – since its pandemic-induced restructure.\nVirgin said the Max 8s will reduce emissions by at least 15% per flight compared to older generation 737s, and will help the airline achieve its 2030 ambition of reducing carbon emissions intensity by 22% and its commitment to targeting net zero emissions by 2050.\nThe Max 8, which is also significantly quieter than existing 737s, has been the subject of repeated controversies. Manufacturer Boeing is still recovering from the biggest crisis in its history after two deadly crashes forced the grounding of its entire 737 Max fleet.\nThe crashes were caused by faulty sensors and design flaws, which aviation regulators are now satisfied have been rectified and the aircraft are safe to fly.\n Alistair Hartley, Virgin Australia chief strategy and transformation officer, said: “We are investing in our fleet to best meet our customers’ needs while positioning the business for success in the long-term. A more modern, sustainable, and streamlined fleet is central to our ongoing transformation.”\nThe investment in a fuel efficient fleet comes ahead of an expectation that private owners Bain Capital will attempt Virgin’s initial public offering – to relist it on the stock exchange – in 2024.\n    Virgin Australia said a ‘more modern, sustainable, and streamlined fleet’ is central to their transformation.

This is about anchoring an urban renewal project that will see Woolloongabba transformed like South Bank was transformed for Expo 88.\nWoolloongabba is an Aboriginal word which translates  to “fight talk place”.

This means critical information is shared across the banking sector at speed about scam transactions, improving the chances of preventing scams and recovering stolen funds.\nThe Australian Banking Association chief executive, Anna Bligh, said:\nThis Scam-Safe accord is a new offensive in the war on scams.

Here’s an excerpt from his story:\nLey said the hardest thing for doctors was to make triage decisions. “We do our triage … [asking] are we going to take this patient because they will have a good chance of surviving rather than doing desperate measures on a patient who will die in two or three days? That sounds nice on paper, but when you have to make the decision it is different. There’s a 12-year-old with 90% burns so we won’t treat him except for pain control that is not enough,” he said.\n“We try to keep our heads cool and steady, but for local staff this is their families, friends, their people. They never want to amputate. They say: ‘I can’t do it any more’ and so I say: ‘OK I will do it, don’t worry,’ and you can feel the relief”.\nLey said he had been shocked at how passive many patients were, such as one 35-year-old woman whose husband and children had been killed when the family’s home was destroyed, and who appeared unmoved when told both her legs would need to be amputated. “So many just don’t care any more,” he said.\n Related:  ‘We are overwhelmed’: southern Gaza’s exhausted doctors forced to leave children to die\nblock-time published-time 5.02am GMT \nThe truce should now theoretically be in effect, as the clocks have struck 7 am in Israel and Gaza.\nblock-time published-time 4.53am GMT \nIsraeli strikes on Gaza have reportedly continued overnight, with Al Jazeera reporting an attack on a residential building in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. \nA BBC reporter in Sderot in southern Israel also noted an Israeli airstrike, drones and the sound of small arms and mortar fire coming from Gaza with less than an hour to go before the truce is supposed to be implemented. \nIt’s now minutes before it is due to take effect. \nblock-time published-time 4.42am GMT \n Israeli forces raid Indonesian hospital, Al Jazeera reports  \nOne woman has been killed and three others wounded after Israeli forces raided the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza, Al Jazeera is reporting, citing Dr Munir al-Bursh, the director general of the Hamas-run ministry of health in Gaza.\nAnother three people were arrested at the hospital, which has been forced to cease operations.

Speaking from Jakarta, he said:\nLast night, Israeli forces attacked the hospital with tanks and destroyed all of the first floor.

Among those reported killed in Nuseirat was a photojournalist, Mohammad Moin Ayyash, and his family.The IDF said it has killed the commander of Hamas’s naval forces in Khan Younis in an airstrike in the Gaza Strip.Amar Abu Jalalah was killed  along with another member of the Hamas naval forces, the IDF said in a statement on Thursday.More than 13,000 Palestinians have been recorded killed in Gaza since the war began, according to Gaza’s health ministry.  The director of the health ministry, which is run by the Hamas government, said another 6,000 people have been reported missing and are feared buried under the rubble. Israel’s assault on Gaza followed the Hamas attack on 7 October which killed at least 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians.UK foreign secretary David Cameron has met Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit to Israel, and expressed hope that the planned temporary truce with Hamas would be an “opportunity to crucially get hostages out and get aid into Gaza”. The Israeli prime minister told Cameron that the precondition for peace in the Middle East was the eradication of what he called the “genocidal terrorist cult” Hamas. His remarks gave the impression that Netanyahu is not currently interested in anything but a military solution  to the future of Israel’s security.Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has urged Israel to rethink its offensive in Gaza, telling its president and prime minister the number of dead Palestinians is “truly unbearable”, and that the response to Hamas’s terrorist attacks last month cannot include “the deaths of innocent civilians,  including thousands of children”.\nEnd of Document\n‘Praying to hear good news’: hopes rise that Thai hostages in Gaza could be freed"," November 24, 2023",2023-11-28
"‘We are overwhelmed’: southern Gaza’s exhausted doctors forced to leave children to die","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-24 05:00:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",1223," Jason Burke in Jerusalem"," A surgeon at one of the territory’s last functioning hospitals tells of desperate conditions amid an acute lack of medicineIsrael-Hamas war – live updates","\nIn the crowded corridors of the European hospital in Khan Younis, exhausted doctors decide who among the huge influx of patients arriving from the north of Gaza  should live or die.\nHundreds of casualties have moved south in recent days after the evacuation of hospitals in Gaza City, overwhelming medical staff already struggling with an acute lack of medicine, diminishing food rations and intermittent power and communications. \nInjured people have joined thousands of displaced people seeking shelter and safety in medical facilities.\nPaul Ley, an orthopaedic surgeon at the European hospital, said displaced people were sleeping in lifts, a small team was working round the clock in four operating theatres to amputate limbs infected after days without treatment, and there was an acute shortage of painkillers. Triage decisions had to be made instantly which, in one case, meant leaving a 12-year-old child to die with only palliative care in order to preserve dwindling resources.\nLey said the hospital had received 500 patients evacuated from hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days.\n“Many have not received treatment for nine or 10 days because hospitals there were non-functional even if they were open,” he said. “This is the situation that is happening here now. This is a functioning hospital but we are being overwhelmed. There is nowhere to evacuate to … There is no escape route. We are probably one of the last lines of defence.”\nThere was no independent confirmation of Ley’s account, but details match the accounts of other medical staff, as well as reporters in Gaza. Ley sent pictures of some of the injuries he described to the Guardian.\nIsrael launched its offensive on Gaza after Hamas, the extremist Islamist group which runs the territory, killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians in their homes or at a dance party, in an attack on 7 October.\nSince then, more than 14,000 people have been killed in Gaza, most of them women or children, according to Palestinian officials.\nIn the burns unit of the European hospital are 78 patients, nearly two-fifths of them children under five.\n“I have never seen anything like it,” said Ley a 60-year-old French citizen who arrived in Gaza with a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross almost four weeks ago. “I have been in many war contexts where the type of wounds are the same but the number is huge. We never leave the hospital. We work round the clock.”\nHospital staff hope the four- or five-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, due to begin on Friday, may lead to a durable end to hostilities – or at least the opportunity to receive supplies of humanitarian aid. However, they also fear the arrival of more patients as injured casualties are evacuated from northern Gaza during any pause.\nMany of the casualties arriving at the hospital were injured days before, meaning wounds have become infected. Ley said some people’s dressings had not been changed for 10 days, so their wounds were full of worms. In other cases, surgeons were forced to amputate limbs that may otherwise have been saved.\nAnother problem is a lack of anaesthetics and painkillers.\n“We do operations with minimal anaesthesia. If we run out, we can’t operate but there is no clear line. There are a lot of people crying, screaming with pain, but we don’t have enough analgesics. We keep them for the kids or very severe cases. [So] normally we would change dressings on patients with 40% burns with them under sedation and minimise the time by using more attendants … [Now] it has to be done with a lot of pain.”\nIn the grounds of the hospital compound, thousands of desperate families are packed into wooden or cardboard shelters. Israeli airstrikes have not targeted the hospital and respected the zone around the facility – though shrapnel has struck the building, and the blast from bombing has shattered windows.\nIsraeli military officials say they make every effort to avoid civilian casualties and observe international law. They say Hamas is using Gaza’s 2.3 million inhabitants as a human shield and claim to have found evidence of Hamas military facilities in or under hospitals, schools and homes. \nOn Thursday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: “The whole laws of war, humanitarian law, which we’re committed to completely, makes a simple distinction … They say on one line are combatants, and the other line are non-combatants. You can target the combatants … but don’t deliberately target the non-combatants. They can be hurt, unintentionally. That accompanies every legitimate war.\n“[Hamas] deliberately implant themselves in hospitals, in schools, in residential areas, in UN facilities. They fire their rockets from there. Thousands of them. They deliberately target civilians and they deliberately hide behind civilians and use them as a human shield. That’s a war crime.”\nElsewhere in Khan Younis, tens of thousands of people have crowded into shelters run by the UN. In one, a vocational training centre before the war, more than 35,000 people share 48 toilets and four showers, administrators there told the Guardian this week.\n“Conditions are appalling. All the children are getting sick with coughs or stomach problems. There are fights over sleeping spaces and food,” said an administrator, who did not have authority to talk to the media.\nSince the Hamas attacks on 7 October, Israel has imposed an almost total blockade of Gaza. Food supplies from the UN have dwindled to about a kg of flour and a single tin of tuna or beans each day, one administrator said, leaving families to survive on flat “bread cakes” made of flour and water cooked on scavenged metal sheets over open fires.\n“There is no food in the shops and no fuel. Even wood is rare and expensive, so people are chopping down trees in the streets. Salt is really rare. No one has any and if you have a bit, you can trade it for a lot of food,” the administrator said.\nLey said the hardest thing for doctors was to make triage decisions. “We do our triage … [asking] are we going to take this patient because they will have a good chance of surviving rather than doing desperate measures on a patient who will die in two or three days? That sounds nice on paper, but when you have to make the decision it is different. There’s a 12-year-old with 90% burns so we won’t treat him except for pain control that is not enough,” he said.\n“We try to keep our heads cool and steady, but for local staff this is their families, friends, their people. They never want to amputate. They say: ‘I can’t do it any more’ and so I say: ‘OK I will do it, don’t worry,’ and you can feel the relief”.\nLey said he had been shocked at how passive many patients were, such as one 35-year-old woman whose husband and children had been killed when the family’s home was destroyed, and who appeared unmoved when told both her legs would need to be amputated. “So many just don’t care any more,” he said.\nBut amid the devastation, there were moments of slender hope. Recently, Ley treated a 32-year-old man with shrapnel injuries to his abdomen, left leg and a “fist-sized hole” in his right forearm. The patient’s young sister thanked Ley, saying she was proud of her brother and happy he was alive. She wanted to be a surgeon whens she was older, she said.\n“So that was very poignant,” Ley said.\nEnd of Document\n‘Proudly marked absent’: hundreds of school students protest in Sydney in support of Palestine"," November 24, 2023",2023-11-28

You inspire me every single day, you will know what is right and what is wrong and you are on the right side of history,” she said to cheers from the students.\n“Your education is working really well because it has brought you out here today. It has taught you how to think for yourself. It has taught you the difference between right and wrong.”\nA number of speakers referred to criticisms of the strike issued by politicians, including NSW premier Chris Minns and state education minister Prue Carr, who said going to a protest was “not a reason to be wagging today”.\n“One of the most important ways you can change the world is get an education,” she said.\n“You will be marked absent if you go to the protest, it’s not a reason to be wagging school today.\n“You need to go to school.”?\nBut grinning students told Guardian Australia they had “jigged for a good cause”, with one year 12 student, Khidash, saying it was important they stood up against what was happening in Gaza.\n“I’m proud that I came here today with my friends, fellow students, cousins, ex’s and crushes. We jigged for a good cause.\n“The Department of Education should know how important this is to us, especially after seeing how many students are absent today,” he said.\nMany arrived draped in the traditional Palestinian scarf, the keffiyeh, and holding Palestinian flags aloft.\nStudents of all ages attended, with many coming from primary school as well as high schools, and marched their way through Sydney’s CBD.\nYear 12 student Zahra said she was proud to be marked absent today, and that she was watching the war in Gaza daily and felt she had to do something.\n“Every day we see these atrocities, we can’t sit back and be silent. Why would I sit in a classroom when I can come today and make history with my brother and sisters?\n“Chris Minns and his fellow politicians are the ones who need to get educated,” she added. “Me and other students at my school don’t stand for what is happening, we are going to stand in solidarity no matter what.\n“Our absence today is a big message, we won’t be silenced.”\nEnd of Document\nFriday briefing: What now after Geert Wilders’ surprise success in the Dutch election"," November 24, 2023",2023-11-28
"Houthi attacks on Israel jeopardise Saudi peace efforts in Yemen","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-24 06:00:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:1",747," Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor"," US reportedly willing to attack Houthi military sites unless Houthis release Israeli-linked ship seized on Sunday","\nAdvanced plans by Saudi Arabia to strike a peace deal with the Houthi rebels in Yemen are being jeopardised by Houthi attacks on Israel and this week’s seizure of an Israeli-linked commercial vessel in the Red Sea.\nSaudi Arabia hopes it can maintain a firewall between the Yemen peace talks and the Houthis’ attacks on Israel, but in London and Washington there is pressure to redesignate the Houthis as a terrorist organisation, which would threaten any deal.\nThere are also reports that the US is willing to launch an attack on Houthi military sites in and around Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, as well as its port operations room, unless the ship seized on Sunday , the Galaxy Leader, is released.\nLast week the Saudis summoned the official UN-recognised Yemen government for further talks in Riyadh to present a revised roadmap that would lead to foreign forces, including those from Saudi Arabia, leaving in six months. It includes a budget deal under which large sums would be transferred from the oil-rich south to the impoverished north, which is dominated by the Iranian-backed Houthis.\nCritics of the deal claim it empowers the Houthis, but Saudi Arabia, eager to exit what has proved to be an ill-judged military intervention in Yemen’s civil war, wants to end its engagement as quickly as possible.\nSaudi Arabia would also fund the payment of salaries to tens of thousands of unpaid government staff.\nIn two rounds of meetings, a multistage Saudi roadmap was outlined to the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), the coalition representing the UN-backed Yemeni government based in Aden and opposed to the Houthis.\nHouthi leaders, who have declared themselves part of an “axis of resistance” of Iran’s allies and proxies retaliating against Israel’s war with Hamas, are determined to show military solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. A third round of cruise missiles fired from Yemen towards Israel were shot down on Thursday morning by a US destroyer.\nSome regard the Houthi missiles and drones as symbolic displays of solidarity designed for a domestic Yemeni audience. However, international alarm grew on Sunday when in a sophisticated helicopter raid Houthi fighters hijacked the Galaxy Leader. The 25-strong crew of the Japanese-managed ship, which includes 17 Filipinos, had been on a journey from Egypt to India.\nThe ship is ultimately owned by the Israeli billionaire Abraham Ungar but the plea to release the crew is being led by Japan.\nThe Houthis say they will target not just Israeli ships but those that protect Israeli ships in the narrow Bab-el-Mandeb strait and the Red Sea. The threat shows how Houthi entrenchment in Yemen, including at the strategic port of Hodeidah, could represent a long-term threat to western shipping interests in the region.\nOn 8 November the Houthis used an Iranian Khordad-3 air defence system to down a US drone.\nThe US national security council spokesperson John Kirby said this week: “In light of the recent targeting of civilians by the Houthis, and now the piracy of a ship in international waters, we have begun a review of potential terrorist designations and we’ll be considering other options together with our allies and partners as well.”\nYemen’s war began when the Houthis descended from their strongholds in northern Yemen and seized Sana’a in 2014, forcing the internationally recognised government to flee to the south and then into exile in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh intervened in 2015. More than 250,000 people are thought to have died as a result of the conflict.\nSaudi efforts to strike a peace deal with the Houthis are aggravated by parts of the PLC opposing its terms on the grounds that the deal would not retain enough funds in the country’s south. The deal would lead to the country’s two central banks and currencies being unified. A military buffer zone between north Yemen and Saudi Arabia would also be established. Discussions on a separate state for the south would be held later.\nThe PLC has strongly condemned the Houthi piracy, while the Houthi leader, Abdulmalik al-Houthi, said it was laughable that the US was claiming to uphold international law.\nThe US may also reactivate the Combined Maritime Forces to protect commercial ships in international trade lanes in the Red Sea.\nOn Monday, the commander of the Houthi coastal defence forces, Muhammad al-Qadiri, warned against “any foreign interference in Yemen’s territorial waters or islands”, saying there would be “an appropriate response to any step of this kind”.\nEnd of Document\nExplainer: have people fleeing the Hamas-Israel war for Australia been through security checks?"," November 24, 2023",2023-11-28
"Ceasefire between Israel and Hamas comes into effect ahead of expected Gaza hostage release","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-24 06:01:00," WORLD NEWS; Version:2",964," Jason Burke in Jerusalem"," Mediator Qatar says operations room in Doha will monitor the truce in seven-week war and the exchange of first group of Israeli hostages for jailed PalestiniansIsrael-Hamas war: latest updates","\nThe ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas came into effect on Friday at 7am, ahead of the expected release of the first group of Israeli hostages held by the militant Islamist organisation in return for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\nUnderlining the fragility of the four day pause in hostilities, an alert sounded in Israel at 7.15am local time warning of a possible incoming rocket from Gaza targeting a village in southern Israel.\nThe diplomatic breakthrough , delayed by 24 hours, marks the first pause in seven weeks of war in Gaza and offers some relief both for the 2.3 million Palestinians in the territory who have endured intensive Israeli bombardment, and for families in Israel fearful for the fate of their loved ones taken captive during the bloody attack launched last month by Hamas that triggered the conflict.\nOfficials in Qatar, which has played a key role as an intermediary, said an operations room there will monitor the truce and the release of hostages from Gaza. They have direct and real-time lines of communication with Israel, the Hamas political office in Doha and the ICRC, Majed al-Ansari, the spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry, Ansari said.\nThe truce, initially lasting four or five days, was announced early on Wednesday  after days of speculation and has raised hopes for a more durable pause in the violence.\nAnsari said the two sides had exchanged lists of those to be released, and the first group of hostages held by Hamas – 13 women and children – would be freed on Friday afternoon. Ansari did not specify how many Palestinian women and children will be released on Friday or when this would take place.\nIncreased aid for Palestinians would start to enter “as soon as possible”, Ansari said.\nUnder the agreement, Hamas will free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages  it has held since launching bloody attacks into southern Israel on 7 October. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza which has endured heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.\nThe exchange of female and child hostages and prisoners was due to take place on Thursday but was postponed as last-minute logistical issues were worked out during 24 hours of frantic diplomacy.\nSources close to the negotiations said Israel  had presented a series of late requests for clarification of practical issues, and demanded the full identification of the hostages Hamas intended to release. Communication between the parties has to pass from Israeli officials to Qatar, then to Hamas  leaders outside Gaza and finally those inside the territory, a process that slowed any resolution of outstanding issues, the sources said.\nThe senior Israeli official in charge of arrangements for the hostage release, Brig Gen Gal Hirsch, confirmed Israel had received a list of the names of the hostages to be freed. “Liaison officers have informed all of those families whose loved ones appear on the list, as well as all of the hostages’ families,” Hirsch said.\nReports in Israel  suggest the hostages will be released across the Rafah border crossing into Egypt and then be brought to Israel by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent (ICRC).\nThe agreement includes a halt to Israeli military flights over southern Gaza , with air activity over northern Gaza restricted to six hours a day. Israel has agreed not to arrest anyone in Gaza for the duration of the truce, according to a Hamas statement.\nHamas is understood to be particularly concerned by the prospect of surveillance by drones during the release of hostages, a process that would expose their militants and potentially some of their infrastructure or even whereabouts of key leaders.\nThe hostages to be freed are women and children, and the Palestinian prisoners are also women and children, both sides have confirmed.\nIf the first exchanges go well, and Hamas can locate more female hostages or children, there will be further releases on both sides, reports suggest. Some sources have suggested the ceasefire could run for up to 10 days.\nThe deal, struck after lengthy and complex talks mediated by Qatar , the US and Egypt, comes more than six weeks after the conflict began last month. At least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October, and more than 240 people taken hostage.\nThe Israeli offensive has killed between 13,000 and 14,000 people, thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials. More are thought to be under rubble. Swaths of northern Gaza have been destroyed in the fighting, and up to a million people displaced.\nIsrael says it has killed thousands of Hamas fighters, without presenting evidence for its count.\nFighting on Thursday had continued at even greater than normal intensity, with Israeli jets hitting more than 300 targets and troops engaged in heavy clashes around Jabalia refugee camp north of Gaza City.\nNGOs working with Palestinian prisoners said the arrangements for their release from Israeli jails was unclear even as late as Thursday evening, with continuing discussions about where they would be freed by Israeli authorities.\nThe prisoners to be freed are understood to come from across the occupied West Bank.\nThough the deal has raised hopes of a more durable cessation of hostilities, Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed it will be temporary and will not end the campaign to destroy Hamas. \nThe Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said during a visit to a naval base on Thursday: “This will be a short respite, at the end of which the fighting will continue intensely, and we will create pressure to bring back more hostages. At least another two months of fighting is expected.”\nEnd of Document\nIsrael-Hamas war live: four-day ceasefire begins but IDF says ‘war is not over yet’"," November 24, 2023",2023-11-28

Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition","\nGood morning. Earlier this week Dutch voters cast their ballots in a knife-edge snap election following the collapse of prime minister Mark Rutte’s coalition government in July. The results surprised many. The anti-Islam, anti-EU populist politician Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) snagged 37 seats in the 150-seat  parliament. That might not sound like a lot but the outgoing centre-right party leading the last government had 34 seats after the previous election.\nEven Wilders himself, not known for self-doubt, was surprised that his party won that many seats. The results have placed the hard-right PVV firmly ahead of any other party, but still below the threshold for an outright majority. The Netherlands finds itself in a political dilemma: how does a country traditionally ruled by coalitions form a functioning government when most other major political parties have previously declared they will not work with the PVV?\nThe left-wing bloc, led by Frans Timmerman, came second with 25 seats, while the centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) was decimated, trailing in third with 24 seats.\nFor today’s newsletter, I spoke with Jon Henley, the Guardian’s Europe correspondent, about what this shock result means for Dutch politics – and what it says about the presence of far-right populist politics in Europe.\n                   Five big stories                   \n                                            Israel-Hamas war  | The four-day ceasefire in Gaza  between Israel and Hamas came into effect on Friday at 7am, ahead of the expected release of the first group of Israeli hostages held by the militant Islamist organisation in return for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The diplomatic breakthrough, delayed by 24 hours, marks the first pause in seven weeks of war in Gaza.\n                                            Monarchy  | A Guardian investigation can reveal that the king is profiting from the deaths of thousands of people in the north-west of England whose assets are secretly being used to upgrade a commercial property empire  managed by his hereditary estate.

A video has emerged from two months ago where the former prime minister can be seen telling investors in Dubai that he wanted to “correct misapprehensions” about the project and quoted from a Chinese-funded study in support of the development.\n                   In depth: ‘Wilders is determined to go into government – but it’s not going to be easy’                   \nFor over two decades, Geert Wilders has been a notorious figure in Dutch politics. His extremist views on Islam, immigration and the EU have earned him a criminal conviction and pushed him to the fringes, but he has remained a consistent presence among Europe’s far right.\nMuslim organisations have expressed concern  about Wilders’ victory: he has described Islam as the “ideology of a retarded culture  ” and a “backward religion”, and the Qur’an as “fascist”. Wilders also has a conviction  for calling Moroccan people “ scum  ”.\nThough Muslims make up about 5% of the population in the Netherlands, the PVV’s manifesto still includes a ban on mosques, the Qur’an and headscarves in government buildings. (In the run-up to the election, Wilders said that all policies will fall “within the law and constitution”.) Other policies he has promoted include holding a “ Nexit  ” referendum to get the Netherlands out of the EU, and cutting financial and military support for Ukraine.\nAfter waiting in the wings for years, Wilders has found himself centre stage of political life in the Netherlands. Will he finally get his hands on power?\n***\n                     Will Geert Wilders be the next prime minister?                   \nIn short, probably not.\nThe Netherlands has one of the most fragmented multiparty political systems in Europe. In this election alone, voters could choose from 26 political parties, 18 of which could enter parliament. No party has won a majority of seats in parliament in over a century.\nSo what happens now? The leader of the largest party, in this case Wilders, has to see if he can form a majority coalition with other parties. The issue is that most of the major parties have already, unequivocally, ruled out forming a coalition with the PVV, particularly with Wilders as prime minister. “The last government took 271 days to form  and that was relatively straightforward compared to what Wilders is up against, especially as he has been shut out of Dutch politics for so long”, Jon says. Wilders is not oblivious to these difficulties and has acknowledged the coalition challenge, saying: “I call on the parties … Now we will have to look for agreements with each other.”\nThe only hope that remains for Wilders is the outgoing VVD party. During the campaign, the party’s leader, Dilan Yesilgöz-Zegerius, said that she was keeping the door open to working  with Wilders. Critics said that she was legitimising Wilders and the PVV. The plan to scoop some of the PVV’s voters backfired and many now view the refusal to condemn Wilders as a terrible strategic mistake, but even Yesilgöz-Zegerius has said that she will not enter a coalition if Wilders is the prime minister. Either way, any coalition that includes the PVV will significantly dilute or completely abandon their most extreme policies.\nThere have also been strong suggestions that the VVD could enter negotiations with Wilders, only to pull out after three to four months, collapsing the process and forcing another election. The other option is some kind of deal where the PVV is outside the coalition but provides parliamentary support in exchange for their policies being put on the agenda as well.\nAnd finally, there is, in theory, a possibility that all three major political parties, the VVD, the leftwing bloc, and the NSC, alongside other parties, could form a government. “So there are a few constellations that are theoretically possible, but they are all impractical”, Jon says.\n“Wilders is clearly determined this time to go into government and, with such a large victory, it is going to be hard to deny”, Jon says. “But that doesn’t mean that it’s going to be easy for him”.\n***\n                     The far-right in Europe                   \nFar-right parties across Europe have been “delighted” by the result, Jon says. Populist leaders have congratulated Wilders:  Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orbán, prematurely announced Wilders’ victory, adding that the results showed “the winds of change are here!”. France’s Marine Le Pen said that Wilders’ shock win “confirms the growing attachment to the defence of national identities”. And Belgian far-right leader Tom Van Grieken proclaimed that “parties like ours are coming all over Europe!”.\nLike Wilders, these leaders have managed to gain more support by diversifying their list of grievances: “For a long time the far-right hobby horse was immigration, Islam and the EU. They’ve added to that fears and concerns about the cost of living crisis, about the green transition and about the cost of the war in Ukraine”, Jon says. One person told the Guardian their reason for voting for the PVV was mainly about the cost of living: “While he said enough is enough he is right, enough is enough. We pay too much tax, too much for healthcare, too much for rent. We can’t take it any more.” \nRegardless of whether Wilders is able to form a coalition, his win confirms that “the far right is on an upward curve, with occasional setbacks”, Jon says. Despite recent losses in Spain  and Poland , generally the far right has been gaining ground all over Europe: in Italy , Finland , Sweden , Austria  and Greece.  Many parties will look at this result as confirmation that the political winds are going in their favour.\n                   What else we’ve been reading                                                               Before Ridley Scott became the latest film-maker to take on this colossus, how was Napoleon represented in art?

It is a loosely autobiographical sitcom in which she stars as Josie, who has a long history of depression, suicidal thoughts and poor mental health. The first couple of episodes don’t establish the characters or dynamics firmly enough and drag a little because the jokes are too far apart. However, there is a particular joy in seeing a woman-led, female-written show that doesn’t pull its punches and revels in plumbing the depths. Such Brave Girls is indeed brave – singular, fresh, scabrous and unflinching – but still – or, rather, as a result – hilarious.Lucy Mangan\n                     Music M1onthebeat: The Mixtape  M1onthebeat’s first mixtape opens with an answering machine message: “I’m busy grafting making this happen,” he says. “History wasn’t made by those sitting there doing nothing.” The “this” is presumably the unexpected commercial rise of UK drill. It is now a genre that spawns chart-topping singles and albums, and it isn’t too self-aggrandising of the producer to suggest he has had an important role in it. The closing track on the debut mixtape Hear No Evil is striking partly because Kojey Radical and Knucks’s lyrics shift away from the preoccupations of drill, partly because of the addictive chorus courtesy of vocalist Miraa May.

But Ridley Scott  – the Wellington of cinema – has created an outrageously enjoyable cavalry charge of a movie, a full-tilt biopic of two and a half hours. Napoleon lives on for those who want to annul the horrors of the 20th century and revive what they take to be the romantic adventure of warfare. For Scott he doesn’t detain the audience with metaphysical meaning and certainly doesn’t withhold the old-fashioned pleasures of spectacle and excitement.

Three people remain in hospital.\nThousands of Thais worked in Israel’s agricultural sector prior to 7 October, and the Israeli government has said they make up the biggest group of foreign people killed or missing in the Hamas attacks. \nThe purported release is not related to the recent deal reached by Israel and Hamas  to hand over dozens of Israeli hostages as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, the report by Al-Araby Al-Jadeed said.\nOver recent weeks, Thai government representatives have met officials in Qatar and Egypt, and last month travelled to Tehran to hold talks with Hamas in an effort to secure hostages’ release.\nAreepen Uttarasin, a lead negotiator, said at the time that he had stressed the innocence of Thai nationals, and had been assured that they were being looked after.\nNeighbouring Malaysia, which is a vocal supporter of Palestine and does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, has also taken part in the effort to get the Thai hostages released. \nSunan Chombua, whose son Komkrit Chombua, 29, was among those abducted, said he felt hopeful, but that no update had been given by Thai officials.\n“Me and my wife are praying to hear good news,” he said. He had not received any communication from the Thai government, even after it was reported earlier this week that a deal had been reached by Israel and Hamas to release 50 hostages during a 4-day ceasefire, he said. “It’s quiet, no update. I haven’t had any update about my son, even from his friends or anywhere else.”\nKomkrit, from Surin province, moved from his home in rural Thailand four years ago to work in Israel, and was initially employed in agriculture and later construction. He would send money back home to his family, and his wages helped his parents to build a new home.\nOn 7 October, a photograph shared online showed Komkri sitting on the floor, head bowed, among a group of hostages taken by Hamas.\nSunan said he was waiting for more information. “I wish they could release all Thai hostages,” he said.\nPrior to the war, 30,000 Thai workers were employed in Israel, with about 5,000 working in areas close to the Gaza Strip. Many Thais move from poorer, rural areas of Thailand to work Israel, where the wages are several times higher.\nThailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it welcomed deal that was agreed between Israel and Hamas earlier this week that will allow for the release of 50 women and children hostages held in Gaza in return for 150 Palestinian women and children who would be freed from Israeli jails during a four-day ceasefire.\n“Thailand fervently hopes that this momentum can be maintained so that the remaining hostages, which include Thai nationals, are released at the earliest opportunity. Thailand reiterates our strong call toward that end,” the ministry said.\nKanchana Patarachoke, spokesperson for Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs, said on Thursday that Thailand had not receive any information regarding whether Thais would be released as part of the deal struck between Israel and Hamas, the Bangkok Post reported.\nThere is only one woman among the Thai hostages, Kanchana said.\nEnd of Document\nHouthi attacks on Israel jeopardise Saudi peace efforts in Yemen"," November 24, 2023",2023-11-28
"Explainer: have people fleeing the Hamas-Israel war for Australia been through security checks?","The Guardian (London)",2023-11-24 08:09:00," AUSTRALIA NEWS; Version:1",1071," Amy Remeikis"," About 800 Palestinians and more than 1,700 Israeli citizens have been granted temporary visas. How does this work?Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast","\nThe federal government has approved more than 800 visas for Palestinians to come to Australia. The announcement has attracted criticism from the opposition over concerns the cohort poses a security risk.\nThe government says all Palestinians offered temporary Australian visas have undergone the necessary security checks. The same checks have been applied to the more than 1,700 Israeli citizens who have been granted temporary visas.\nThe visa application process is complex and confusing. Not all details are made public for security reasons. Here’s what we know so far.\n                   What sort of visa has been granted?                   \nThe visa offered to Palestinians and Israeli citizens wanting to come to Australia is not a permanent visa. It’s a visitor visa, subclass 600, which allows for temporary entry for up to 12 months. In most cases, people will live with family in Australia. Between 7 October and 20 November, 1,793 visas were granted to Israeli citizens and 860 to Palestinians. \n                   Is it only during war that this happens?                   \nNo. Visas requests from conflict zones may receive priority, and there may be an increase to the number Australia would usually accept, but these visas exist as part of Australia’s visa system and have not been specially created.\n                   Has this happened before?                   \nYes. Most recently, the former Coalition government granted 3,000 visitor visas to Ukrainian citizens  between 23 February to 11 March 2022, after the Russian invasion. The Morrison government also approved 5,000 temporary visas for Afghans  between 18 August and 20 September 2021, after the US withdrawal from the country and the return of the Taliban to power.\n                   Can anyone get a visa?                   \nNo. There are still strict character, security and identity checks which must be undertaken as part of the visitor visa process, even for children.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe character checks can be found here , but there are additional security checks which are undertaken which are not as public. Those security checks vary in their thoroughness depending on which country or region the person applying is associated with, or lives in. \nFor example, someone applying from Britain will not have a lower level of security check as someone applying from Syria, Iran or Palestine.\n                   What is Peter Dutton saying?                   \nThe opposition leader, Peter Dutton,has raised concerns over whether enough time has passed for those checks to have taken place when it comes to approving Palestinian visas. On Friday, Dutton said:\n“We have a big humanitarian program; happy for that to continue, and it may well include people coming out of the Middle East, but at the moment, to take people out of Gaza, through a desktop search from a person in Canberra in the Immigration Department, without the requisite security checks being undertaken is reckless and it’s also dangerous.\n“You can’t be taking people out of a war zone and bring them to Australia without the checks being conducted and it’s obvious that the government hasn’t done it because they’ve got to go to the US – by way of one example – to their database holdings, who have the most significant database holdings in terms of biometrics and in terms of those people who have been flagged in the Middle East as being of concern.”\nDutton claims he is able to speak on this with authority because as a former minister for home affairs, he knows how the procedure works and how long the checks can take.\n                   What has the government said?                   \nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the foreign minister, Penny Wong, have strongly rejected Dutton’s claims.  As has the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, who accused Dutton of attempting to stoke fears for political gain.\n“National security is the first priority of our government. As security agencies have repeatedly warned, inflammatory language has a direct link to increased risk of violence. Everyone in our parliament needs to consider the impact that their language will have,” she said.\n                   What checks have been done?                   \nEvery applicant undergoes a series of checks, including with security agencies, before a visa is granted. Those checks include criminal records, aliases, known associates, checks of their family and a character test. For a visa to be approved, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has to have assessed that the applicant is not a direct or indirect security risk.\nFor Asio to come to that decision, it is not just Australian databases which are relied upon. Australia is a member of Five Eyes, which includes the UK, the US, Canada and New Zealand and also has strategic relationships with Asean countries, which gives Australia access to security partner databases.\nAmnesty International Australia’s refugee rights adviser, Dr Graham Thom, said   “in line with the variance and complexity within Australia’s visa system, Palestinians seeking entry to Australia are already subject to comprehensive assessment and robust security checks. While the government keeps the specifics of those checks confidential, Australia’s membership to the Five Eyes Alliance indicates the vast scope of intelligence that the government can consider when issuing visas.”\n                   Have the Palestinian visas been approved faster than usual?                   \nThere is no evidence of that.\nPalestinians also have more identity documents to hand than other groups seeking to escape a conflict zone, because of the unique situation of life in Gaza and the West Bank, which requires passage through Israeli check points. A lot of the information Australian authorities require has already been gathered.\nVisas are also routinely provided to family members who meet eligibility criteria, which has been the case under all Australian governments.\nIt is also important to note that being granted a visa does not mean someone can automatically leave Gaza. Citizens still have to be able to cross from Gaza into Egypt and this has proven very difficult in many cases. So far, only 127 Australian citizens, permanent residents and family members have been able to cross the border. Another 69 Australians have sought to leave, but have so far been unable to.\nEnd of Document\nAfternoon Update: Lehrmann denies trying to get Higgins drunk; Israel-Hamas truce begins; and calls for domestic violence inquiry"," November 24, 2023",2023-11-28

It has direct and realtime lines of communication with Israel, the Hamas political office in Doha and the ICRC, said Majed al-Ansari, the spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry.\n                                                                                        What has the IDF said about the ceasefire? “The war is not over yet,” the Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee has said in a message in Arabic  to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said: “The humanitarian pause is temporary. The northern Gaza Strip is a dangerous warzone and it is forbidden to move north. For your safety, you must remain in the humanitarian zone in the south.”                                                                                          When will hostages be released? The exchange of female and child hostages and prisoners was due to take place on Thursday but was postponed as last-minute logistical issues were worked out during 24 hours of frantic diplomacy. Sources close to the negotiations said Israel had presented a series of late requests for clarification of practical issues, and demanded the full identification of the hostages Hamas intended to release.                                                                                Axl Rose, Jamie Foxx, Eric Adams: flurry of last-minute claims gives sex abuse law powerful legacy                                      \nNew York’s year-long “look-back” window on sexual assault closed last night  after a flurry of last-minute claims against high-profile figures including the singer Axl Rose, the actor Jamie Foxx and the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams.\nSome of the alleged incidents date back decades, in claims that would otherwise have fallen outside the statute of limitations.\nThe New York State law, which allowed adult sexual abuse survivors to sue their abusers beyond the statute of limitations for the course of one year, led to approximately 2,500 claims. It closed at midnight on Thursday.\nIt grabbed headlines immediately when the writer E Jean Carroll restated a rape and defamation claim against Donald Trump mere minutes after the look-back window opened.\n                                                                                        Was the window a success? Beyond a year-long supply of headlines featuring high-profile names, many say that the adult survivors’ window, signed into law in May last year by the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, may not have lasted long enough to address all the potential claims by survivors. It was noted that many victims do not have powerful law firms behind them with a possible settlement award at the end of the process.                                                           \nThe North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, has celebrated a “new era of a space power”  with his family including daughter Ju-ae and the scientists who put the North’s first spy satellite into orbit. Pyongyang’s launch of the Malligyong-1 on Tuesday was its third attempt after failures in May and August.\nImages released by Pyongyang showed Kim praising scientists and space program workers at the National Aerospace Technology Administration (Nata) while accompanied by Ju-ae.\nWearing a black leather coat, a grinning Kim was seen waving at the uniformed workers, all of whom appeared to be enthusiastically cheering him and Ju-ae.\n                                                                                        Was the launch actually successful? South Korea confirmed the launch was successful but said it was too early to determine if the satellite was functioning as claimed by the North. After Tuesday’s launch, South Korea partially suspended a five-year-old military accord with the North  and deployed “surveillance and reconnaissance assets” to the border.

CNN, citing FBI officials, reported that the car was a Bentley and the driver believed to be from western New York State.                                                                                          The family farming company of a Republican candidate for the US Senate was found liable on Tuesday in a plot to fix the price of eggs.   Rose Acre Farms, which claims to be the second-largest egg producer in the country was accused in a civil suit of cutting supply to raise prices.                                                                                          South Africa’s former Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius, jailed in 2014 for killing his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, will get another chance for an early release  at a parole hearing tomorrow.  Pistorius shot and killed Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day in 2013.                                                                                          Buses and trams have been torched and a shop looted during riots in Dublin city centre after                         three children were injured in a stabbing attack outside a school.

The research, conducted by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) not-for-profit, looked at 73 products and found at least one pesticide in 22 of them. Many products showed more than one pesticide.\n“Babies and young children are particularly vulnerable to the health risks posed by pesticides in food – and food is the way most children will be exposed to pesticides,” co-author of the report Sydney Evans said.\n                                        Don’t miss this: Geert Wilders’ victory confirm                     ed                                      \nGeert Wilders’ shock victory in the Dutch general election confirms the upward trajectory of Europe’s populist and far-right parties, which – with the occasional setback – are continuing their steady march into the mainstream, writes Jon Henley. There is no guarantee that Wilders, whose anti-Islam Party for Freedom (PVV) won 37 seats in Wednesday’s ballot – more than twice its 2021 total – will be able to form a government with a majority in the Netherlands’ 150-seat parliament.\nFrom Helsinki to Rome and Berlin to Brussels, far-right parties are climbing steadily up the polls , shaping the policies of the mainstream right to reflect their nativist and populist platforms, and occupying select ministerial roles in coalition governments.\n                                        Climate check: US coal power plants killed at least 460,000 people in past 20 years – report                                      \nCoal-fired power plants killed at least 460,000 people in the US during the past two decades , causing twice as many premature deaths as previously thought, new research has found. Cars, factories, fire smoke and electricity plants emit tiny toxic air pollutants known as fine particulate matter or PM2.5, which elevate the risk of an array of life-shortening medical conditions including asthma, heart disease, low birth weight and some cancers. Researchers analyzed Medicare and emissions data from 1999 and 2020, and for the first time found that coal PM2.5 was twice as deadly as fine particle pollutants from other sources. Previous studies quantifying the death toll from air pollution assumed all PM2.5 sources posed the same risk, and therefore likely underestimated the dangers of coal-powered plants.\n                                        Last Thing: Conservators remove ‘Kylie Jenner treatment’ from 17th-century portrait                                      \nIf you think the modern influencer’s penchant for big lips reflects a beauty fad, then think again. According to English Heritage, a painting within the charity’s collection of a Jacobean “beauty” has been found to have received the so-called “Kylie Jenner treatment”  – with touch-ups involving plumping the sitter’s lips and lowering her hairline. Now, hours of painstaking conservation has revealed the true face of Diana Cecil, a 17th-century noblewoman, who was regarded as one of the great beauties of her time – but whose appearance had been changed for centuries.\n“Arbitrary and ever-changing beauty standards do seem to echo through the ages, although in this case Diana had no say in the ‘improvements’ made to her portrait centuries after it was painted,” said Louise Cooling, English Heritage’s curator at Kenwood.\n                                        Sign up                                      \nFirst Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.
