'My father is missing': Israel arrests Gaza patients in Jerusalem hospital

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Jerusalem – Saeb Ali al-Tanani, 14, has a tumour in his leg. Last Wednesday, Suhaila, his grandmother, was with him as he wheeled himself down the corridor at Makassed Hospital in occupied East Jerusalem.
'He has to do genetic and blood tests, so he will be here a while,' Suhaila said, while remembering their family in Gaza. 'Our hearts break for what our family are going through in Gaza.'
Saeb echoed his grandmother's worries. "We are scared for our family," he told Al Jazeera. "I want to go back to my home."
A day later, fear would come to haunt the hospital itself.
On Thursday,Israeli forces arrested Suhaila. She is one of 12 Palestinians in detention who were either receiving treatment at Makassed Hospital in occupied East Jerusalem, or were acting as medical chaperones for patients.
According to a statement by the Israeli police, the Palestinians were staying "illegally" at the hospital, after their medical permits, issued by the Israeli military, expired.
"In a joint operation by the Jerusalem District Police and Jerusalem security guard soldiers, 12 female and male suspects residing illegally in Israel were identified and arrested," the police said in a statement, adding that the deputy director of the hospital was also summoned for interrogation.
"Of these, 11 residents of the Gaza Strip are suspected of remaining in the hospital over the past few weeks in violation of the law, and the other suspect is a Palestinian who [is] residing in Israel illegally."
Four men and seven women from Gaza were arrested, the statement said.

(Translation: [Israeli] occupation forces storming Al-Makassed Hospital in the town of al-Tur in occupied Jerusalem.)
Samira Aweina, a hospital attendant at Makassed, said dozens of Israeli police and soldiers raided the hospital on Thursday.
"They all came in at once, and immediately sealed off the other entrances," she said.
"They arrested a group of elderly women from the emergency room with the young children they were with," she continued. "They arrested one of our patient's father, and another patient's grandmother."
Qaddoura Fares, the head of the Prisoners and Ex-Prisoners Affairs Commission for the Palestinian Authority (PA), told Al Jazeera that the PA did not have any information on those arrested.
"The occupation authorities did not provide us or the Red Cross any details about the detainees from Gaza," he said, speaking from the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah. "We don't even know where they are being held or what their names are."
Usually, Israel provides the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) with the names of Palestinians it has arrested. The Red Cross in turn informs the PA. The role of the ICRC typically includes visiting detainees and restoring contact between family members.

'I want Mama and Baba'
Other patients and their accompanying relatives said they are stuck in limbo, unable to go home, and forced to stay at the hospital.
Imm Taha al-Farra is with her nine-year-old granddaughter Hala, who underwent a spinal operation on October 7.
"We were supposed to go back after a few days," Imm Taha said. "We can't go back now. We don't know anything. How are we supposed to go back?"
Hala, who said she wants to be a doctor so that she can treat children, has been asking to go home for weeks.
"I want Mama and Baba," she said. "I miss my brothers Omar and Ali."
Their family live in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Imm Taha said the families of her nieces and nephews, all 16 members, were killed in an Israeli air raid on their home.

Another patient, Mahdiya al-Shanti, has also been in the hospital for more than a month.
"I was supposed to go home towards the end of October, but now I can't because of the war," the 20-year-old from northern Gaza said.
"It's hard to know how my family is doing all the time because the internet cuts off and sometimes they can't charge their phones," she continued. "They fled the north to Khan Younis but since there's no safe place in Gaza it's like they went from one danger zone to another."
Mahdiya's father had accompanied her as a medical chaperone. He too was among those arrested by Israeli forces last Thursday.
Mahdiya said that the forces stormed the hospital and barged into patients' rooms and the rooms where the medical chaperones stay.
"They said they were looking for anyone from Gaza," she said.
She quickly sent a message to her dad, who was in one of those rooms, warning him that the Israeli forces were around. But it was too late.
"I don't know where they've taken him," Mahdiya said. "How can they do this in a hospital? Now I'm all alone and sick with worry. My family is in Gaza, my father is missing, and I am a patient here all by myself."

Hospital stay in the balance
There are six Palestinian hospitals in occupied East Jerusalem offering medical specialties that the Palestinian health ministry is unable to provide in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
According to Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) , more than 50 percent of patients in these hospitals are referred from the occupied territories.
Makassed Islamic Charitable Society Hospital was established in 1968 and included 60 beds. The hospital continued to expand, and now has 250 beds, making it the main referral hospital for the Palestinian community in Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
According to the administration of the Makassed Hospital, there were 53 patients from the Gaza Strip, each with one chaperone from their family, when the Israeli security forces raided the institution. The hospital, which said it was not authorised to give statements on the Thursday raid to the media, declined to say how many of the Gaza patients and chaperones remained.
Doctors have spoken about the fear of reprisals if they speak – including the prospect of arrests or losing their jobs.
As for the patients from Gaza, their anxiety over what's happening to their families in the coastal enclave is compounded by their own unfamiliar situation.
Nafez al-Qahwaji follows the news coming out of the Gaza Strip on his phone and says he cannot sleep because he is so afraid for his children, who are in Khan Younis [Faiz Abu Rmeleh/Al Jazeera]
Nafez al-Qahwaji, who was referred to the Makassed Hospital by the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, spent three days in the hospital before the war began.
"The Israeli intelligence called my number and told me to evacuate my home in Khan Younis," al-Qahwaji said. "I called my children immediately and told them to leave the house for fear that it would be targeted. Now they are sheltering at a UN school."
Al-Qahwaji declined to disclose what he was getting treated for, and initially thought he would only stay for a week or two.
"I don't have appropriate clothes now that winter is coming," he said. "I don't know how I will go back home if Erez is destroyed," he added, referring to the Israeli checkpoint in northern Gaza that is also known as the Beit Hanoon crossing.

Dozens from same family killed in Gaza as Israel continues bombardment

November 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Dozens of people from the same family have been killed in the Jabalia refugee camp, the Palestinian foreign minister has said, as Israel continued to bombard the besieged Gaza Strip in the hours after an agreement was reached for a   that was expected to go into effect on Thursday.
Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said on a visit to London on Wednesday that 52 members of one family were killed in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.
"Only this morning, from the Qadoura family in Jabalia, 52 people have been wiped out completely, killed," he said.
"I have the list of the names, 52 of them. They were wiped out completely from grandfather to grandchildren."
In southern Gaza, Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum said that heavy strikes continued on Wednesday in the lead-up to the humanitarian pause.
'These areas are considered to be 'safe places' to flee to from the north," he said after an Israeli strike left a residential building in Khan Younis "completely destroyed".
"But they are experiencing the same level of Israeli bombardments."
Separately in Khan Younis, the bodies of more than 100 Palestinians originally held at the al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, which has been repeatedly raided by Israeli forces, were buried in a mass grave.
The agreement between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that governs Gaza, comes after nearly seven weeks of war in the besieged territory that has killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands of others.
Key details of the agreement remain unclear, but it is expected to include the release of 50 civilian hostages held in Gaza, the release of 150 Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons and a four-day halt   in Gaza. The pause is expected to coincide with an influx of humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave.
United Nations chief Antonio Guterres described the agreement as "an important step in the right direction,' but added that 'much more needs to be done to end the suffering".
The deal, expected to come into effect on Thursday morning, has been welcomed by rights groups and political leaders as a sign of potential progress towards the end of the fighting, which began on October 7 when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that killed about  , according to Israeli officials.
Israeli authorities have said that most of the victims were civilians and that Palestinian armed groups also took about 240 others   during the attack.
Israel promised to dismantle Hamas and unleashed a devastating assault on Gaza that has wiped out entire neighbourhoods and killed more than 14,500 people, according to Palestinian authorities, including more than 5,600  .
Alongside the bombardment, Israel has   supplies of food, electricity, fuel, and water for the Strip's more than 2.3 million residents, with international aid groups warning of a humanitarian catastrophe.
Medical officials have warned that disease could spread amid dire conditions and  .
Refugee camps,  , and hospitals sheltering the displaced have all been targeted, and a trickle of humanitarian assistance coming through the border crossing with Egypt has not been enough to address the scale of suffering.
Aid groups say a key ambition is to get help to northern Gaza, which has been largely inaccessible and where nearly all hospitals stopped working during a blistering air and ground offensive by Israeli forces.
"The entire humanitarian sector is ready to scale up once everything is set," said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Israeli authorities have stressed that the temporary pause to the fighting will not mean an end to the war.
"We are at war, and we will continue the war until we achieve all our goals: to destroy Hamas, return all our hostages and ensure that no entity in Gaza can threaten Israel," Israeli Prime Minister   said in a recorded message.
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said the implementation of the agreement was a 'complex process that may take time'.
Officials from Arab countries welcomed the truce and said they hoped it could lead to further agreements in the future.
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud also welcomed the truce, but insisted that increased humanitarian assistance resulting from the deal 'must remain in place and must be built upon".
Qatari official Mohammed al-Khulaifi, who helped broker the deal, said that he hopes the agreement will lead to a 'bigger agreement and a permanent cease of fire'.

Where in Gaza is al-Ahli Arab Hospital, the site hit amid war with Israel?

October 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A massive blast at al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza killed at least 500 Palestinians, triggering global outrage at the slaughter of people, many of whom were taking shelter from nearly two weeks of relentless Israeli bombing of the besieged enclave.
Palestinians say Israel bombed the hospital while Tel Aviv has blamed Gaza-based armed groups for the horrific explosion that has clouded US President Joe Biden's diplomatic mission to the Middle East. The Palestinian armed groups have denied their role.
As tensions continue to rise,   about the hospital:
Where is al-Ahli Arab Hospital?
The al-Ahli Arab Hospital is located in Gaza's Old City between the Shujaiya and Zeitoun neighbourhoods in Gaza City.
It is situated just less than 3km from al-Shifa Hospital, the largest public hospital in the enclave of 2.3 million people. The facility is also near several historical sites in Gaza, including the Great Omari Mosque, known as Gaza's Great Mosque and two of Gaza's churches: St Philip the evangelist chapel and St Porphyrius Church.
The Great Mosque, which stands just 300 metres (0.2 miles) from the hospital, is both the largest and oldest mosque in the 10km (6 miles) by 41km (25 miles) in the Strip – one of two Palestinian territories, the other being the occupied West Bank. The area is also in proximity to Gaza's historic Zawiyam Market.
Al-Ahli is one of the oldest hospitals in Gaza founded in 1882, and it serves more than 45,000 patients each year.
At what time did the strike take place?
It's unclear, but according to the Israeli military at 6:59pm (3:59 GMT) there were reports of an explosion at the hospital.
'The devastation witnessed, coupled with the sacrilegious targeting of the church, strikes at the very core of human decency. We assert unequivocally that this is deserving international condemnation and retribution," the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, which runs the hospital, said in a statement .
In the first hours after the blast, a Gaza civil defence chief said 300 people were killed, while health ministry sources put the figure at 500.
Where were the victims taken after the explosion in the hospital?
Large numbers of injured people were brought to al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
Al Jazeera footage from the scene showed medics and civilians recovering bodies with white bags or blankets. Bloodstains and multiple torched cars were visible in the darkened hospital courtyard.

What else do we know about the al-Ahli Arab Hospital?
The hospital is the oldest and the only Christian hospital in Gaza, according to the Jerusalem diocese's website.
It's one of the 22 hospitals in northern Gaza struggling to respond to the recent crisis that has seen 3,300 Palestinians killed and more than 13,000 wounded as Israel has targeted residential infrastructures.
As well as running a programme for breast cancer detection, the hospital also provides  "free community clinic with transportation from outlying neighbourhoods, clinic for underweight and manourished children, physical and occupational therapy".
According to reports by The Wall Street Journal, the hospital "recently got a new cancer ward with funds coming mainly from the American Friends of the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem in Texas". It's currently headed by Suhaila Tarazi.
How many health facilities have been attacked so far in October?
There have been over 115 attacks on healthcare in Palestine since the start of the conflict on October 7, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
At least 20 hospitals in Gaza City and North Gaza and one hospital in Rafah have received repeated evacuation orders from the Israeli military, and 77 attacks have been documented in the West Bank, 43 of these attacks have caused physical violence to health teams.
'Gaza's medical infrastructure has been irreparably damaged and healthcare providers are working in a dire situation with limited access to medical supplies and conditions that do not allow them to provide timely and quality healthcare,' said Tlaleng Mofokeng, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health.

September 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A Palestinian man has been shot and killed by Israeli forces during a raid in an occupied West Bank town following a confrontation that resulted in a building being destroyed.
Abdul Rahim Fayez Ghannam, 36, was shot in the head in Aqaba, north of Tubas, and pronounced dead at the local hospital on Friday.
Nidal Odeh, director of emergency services in Aqaba, told local media that Israeli forces prevented ambulances from reaching the wounded, and one ambulance was  .
Israeli forces raided the town looking for Ahmad Walid, who they accused of carrying out a shooting attack near a checkpoint in the Jordan Valley last month.
Witness Saleh Abu Arra told Al Jazeera the Israeli soldiers thought Walid was hiding in one of the buildings but he was not there.
"The raid started at about 5am. My two brothers live with their families in the building that was surrounded by Israeli forces," the 39-year old said.

One of his brothers, Bakr Abu Arra, was apprehended by the Israelis.
"They yelled at him on loudspeakers to come out with his family, and proceeded to beat him with their guns and curse at him, terrifying his wife and children," Saleh Abu Arra said.
After half an hour, Israeli forces started firing sound bombs and tear gas canisters at the building, then targeted the second and third floors with antitank grenades, which also destroyed an adjacent wedding hall.
Violent confrontations ensued for the next five hours, another witness Amir al-Qasem said,   at the ruined building with live ammunition, and Palestinian residents throwing objects at military vehicles.
Armed Palestinian men also targeted the Israeli convoy with live fire.
"The martyr Fayez was caught in the crossfire," al-Qasem said. "He is a farmer and was on his way to his fields."
Al-Qasem said the Israelis failed in their mission to arrest Walid, and then began firing randomly at the destroyed house and surrounding areas.
"I've never seen such a huge amount of bullet casings inside the building," he said.

Israeli forces arrested the two brothers Bakr and Mohammed Abu Arra and their father Abdelrazeq.
Ahmad Walid's brother Mushrif told Al Jazeera he were surprised   called him on the phone.
"My brother is a labour worker inside Israel, and he goes away for two weeks to a month at a time," Mushrif said.
"We told the Israelis that he isn't here, but they forced my elderly parents outside and took them to the Abu Arra building and made them call for Ahmad to surrender himself on the loudspeakers."
In a statement, the Israeli army said a firefight broke out between armed fighters and soldiers and "a hit was identified on one of the gunmen".
Troops also "used shoulder-fired missiles and grenades" and subsequently found improvised explosive devices and other weapons in the building, it said.
The near-daily Israeli military raids have resulted in some of the worst fighting in the occupied West Bank since the early 2000s.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the start of this year, with the United Nations saying 2023 is   since the world body began recording Palestinian fatalities in 2006.

October 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The tactics we have seen   in their attack on Israel last Saturday have been some of their most sophisticated yet, suggesting a level of planning and preparation we have not witnessed before.
The group used air, sea and land in what in military terms is known as multi-domain operations. It carried out initial strikes on Israeli observation posts using drones before its massive rocket attacks overwhelmed the Israeli Iron Dome defences. These were what are referred to as shaping operations - in essence preparing for the next stage, the physical entry into Israel.
Next was an unprecedented physical infiltration, attacking Israeli civilians and military targets from multiple directions. Underpinning all these activities has been the use of fear tactics against civilians - including by recording and broadcasting attacks in Israeli border communities and a   as well as by capturing Israeli soldiers and civilians and   into the Gaza Strip.
Hamas also attacked Israeli military targets killing and capturing people and capturing Israeli military equipment.
Developing threat
Hamas appears to have learned from various sources. They have taken inspiration from Hezbollah's military infrastructure and rebel warfare strategies. They have received training, funding and weapons from Iran.
The group has utilised lessons from past encounters with Israeli forces, studied the tactics employed by   in 2002, and incorporated their own innovations in the form of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), tunnel networks, psychological warfare and asymmetric warfare.
Hamas has utilised Iranian expertise in manufacturing homemade rockets and improving their accuracy and range.
Past encounters with Israeli forces, particularly during the 2014 war on Gaza, have taught Hamas the value of urban warfare and the use of civilian infrastructure as shields.
They have incorporated these tactics into their current attack too,using densely populated areasas launching sites for rockets andhiding weapons and command and control centres in civilian structures.
This sets up a dynamic whereby when Hamas is attacked by Israeli bombs, both sides can accuse each other of violating international law. The Law of Armed Conflict prohibits the targeting of an enemy's civilians. It also requires parties to an armed conflict to distinguish their fighter forces from their own civilians, and not to base operations in or near civilian structures, especially protected sites such as schools, medical facilities and places of worship.
Jenin lessons
Hamas appears to have also drawn specific insights from the tactics employed by the Jenin fighters during the   in 2002. In April 2002, an Israeli assault on the Jenin refugee camp resulted in at least 52 Palestinians killed, according to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) investigation, including women and children. There were also 23 Israeli soldiers killed and several others injured due to the tactics used by Palestinian fighters. The battle has become a symbol of Palestinian resistance.
The Battle of Jenin was a significant event in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where Palestinian fighters utilised a combination of rebel tactics, IEDs and urban warfare strategies against Israel's military.
One of the key lessons Hamas appears to have learned from the Battle of Jenin was the effectiveness of IEDs in inflicting casualties and disrupting Israeli military operations. IEDs are low-cost and easily concealable, making them a valuable tool for asymmetrical warfare. Hamas has since incorporated IEDs into its arsenal, using them to target Israeli military vehicles, patrols and installations. Should Israel launch a ground offensive into Gaza, we will almost certainly see these tactics used again.
One of the biggest learnings Hamas gained from the Jenin fighters was the importance of strategic mobility and surprise. During the Battle of Jenin, the Jenin fighters utilised a   to move fighters and supplies, evade Israeli forces, and launch surprise attacks. Hamas has since invested heavily in tunnel infrastructure, constructing an extensive network of underground passages that enable them to bypass Israeli checkpoints and mount attacks from unexpected locations.This current attack has taken surprise to a new level.
Hidden planning
The use of tunnels and underground facilities will almost certainly have aided the concealment of preparation from Israeli intelligence. However, the effort put into that concealment is yet another level of sophistication not previously seen: The operation would have taken several months to plan.
Hamas will have studied Israeli intelligence gathering, identified Israeli sources and kept them focused elsewhere, so that preparations will have been hidden in what intelligence agencies refer to as 'background noise.'
Some of that background noise includes the internal political tensions in Israel itself.
An uneven contest
However, at the end of the day, compared with the sophisticated heavy weaponry and airpower the Israelis have, Hamas has homemade IEDs, rockets and light weapons supplementing a small number of more sophisticated but light weapons smuggled in.
This is why the group relies on asymmetric warfare - using a strategy of hit-and-run attacks, ambushes and sniper fire to minimise their own casualties and maximise the impact of their operations by reducing direct confrontations.
What is not clear is the end state Hamas expects from this latest attack. Unless it can stimulate wider Middle East involvement against Israel, then all it has done is set diplomacy back years and cause the deaths of many innocent civilians in Israel and in Gaza. Whether Israeli or Palestinian, it is always the innocent people who suffer most.
So, will their operational surprise turn into their strategic loss? Only time and more lives will tell.

Palestine Red Crescent says Israel orders evacuation of al-Quds Hospital

October 29th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) on Sunday said it has received 'serious threats' from Israeli forces to 'immediately evacuate" the al-Quds Hospital in Gaza as it is "going to be bombed'.
The hospital, located in the Tal al-Hawa area of Gaza City, said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that "since this morning, there have been bombs dropping 50 metres from the hospital".
The threat comes as Israel has bombed several hospitals in the besieged Gaza Strip enclave, which has been under intense attacks for the past three weeks that have killed more than 8,000 people, mostly women and children.
Palestinians have also   on October 17 that killed nearly 500 people, many of them displaced Palestinians. Israel has denied its role in the explosion.
The PRCS has reported that the hospital is currently providing care to hundreds of injured patients, including those in intensive care units and newborns in incubators. Around 12,000 unarmed displaced civilians, with a majority being children and women, have also sought refuge in the hospital building.
WHO chief raises concerns
The hospital also accommodates PRCS personnel, operating rooms, and ambulance crews who are tirelessly serving hundreds of thousands of citizens in the northern Gaza Strip.
The United Nations health agency chief has also expressed concerns about the Israeli threats.
'We reiterate - it's impossible to evacuate hospitals full of patients without endangering their lives,' Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director of the World Health Organization (WHO), said on X.
The @PalestineRCS  report of evacuation threats to Al-Quds hospital in Gaza is deeply concerning.
We reiterate – it's impossible to evacuate hospitals full of patients without endangering their lives.
Under International Humanitarian Law, healthcare must always be protected.
- Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) October 29, 2023
While warnings from Israel to bomb this hospital have intensified over the past week, Al Jazeera has obtained exclusive aerial photographs of the al-Quds Hospital, taken just hours after it received the most recent threat of Israeli air strikes.
The aerial scenes depict a significant gathering of displaced individuals seeking refuge in the hospital's courtyards. Hundreds of citizens have flocked to the hospital as it continues to admit victims of the ongoing Israeli bombardment in Gaza.
The pictures also reveal the presence of ambulances and the preparedness of medical teams stationed at the hospital entrance.
Ground operations expanded
Meanwhile, as Israel's ground forces have expanded their operations in Gaza, bombings around hospitals have intensified.
On Friday after Gaza experienced a near-total telecommunications blackout, Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said the Israeli military spokesperson had distributed a map asserting that the al-Shifa Hospital was the headquarters of Hamas's leadership.
"Hamas denied this … and at about 7pm local time, a major attack by sea and land took place, concentrated on the northern part of the Gaza Strip, around the vicinity of al-Shifa Hospital," Mahmoud said on Saturday.
Al Jazeera has also obtained exclusive footage of the latest attacks to have hit next to al-Shifa Hospital and the Indonesian Hospital.
Dr Marwan al-Hams, director of Abu Yousef al-Najjar Hospital located in the Rafah region, told Al Jazeera that children and women have become targets for Israel through these attacks.
He also called on the International Criminal Court and human rights institutions to intervene immediately to stop the massacres against innocent civilians.

Bernie Sanders's failure to back Gaza ceasefire disappoints US supporters

October 30th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - In a stunning moment during the 2016 United States presidential race, Senator Bernie Sanders called out his then-rival   for failing to mention Palestinian rights in a speech she delivered to a pro-Israel lobby group.
Standing on stage in a nationally televised primary debate, Sanders highlighted the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and criticised the unconditional support that the Israeli government — under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — receives from Washington.
"There comes a time when, if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time," he said.
It was a rare statement to come from a Washington politician. Few, even among left-leaning Democrats, have questioned whether the United States should reconsider its "unwavering" support for Israel.
But flash forward seven years, and Sanders is now drawing ire from many of his supporters who feel let down by his current stance towards the Israel-Hamas war.
As the Israeli military offensive in Gaza intensifies, killing   and levelling entire neighbourhoods, Sanders has not called for a ceasefire. Because of his reputation as an anti-war voice, critics say he is uniquely positioned to amplify demands for ending the hostilities in Gaza.
'At a time when Washington is lining up behind those, including the president, who are beating the drums of war, we need leaders with the courage and the legacy of anti-war activism to break that consensus and say all human life is precious by demanding a ceasefire," said Eva Borgwardt, political director at IfNotNow, a progressive Jewish group.
"If anyone can do that in the Senate, it is Senator Sanders."
Sanders's position
Last week, activists held a protest at Sanders's Senate office to call on him to back a ceasefire.
"We went to his office to say we — and his colleagues in the House who are bravely speaking out, at great personal and political risk — need him now,' Borgwardt told Al Jazeera in a statement.
Democratic House members introduced a   on October 16, but on the Senate side, there have been no calls for ending the war.
Earlier this month, almost 300 former staffers who worked on Sanders's presidential campaigns signed a letter calling on him to introduce a similar resolution.
'President [Joe] Biden clearly values your counsel, as is shown by the ways you've managed to shape the outcomes of his presidency,' the letter, first reported by The Intercept , said. 'We urge you to make it clear what is at stake in this crisis politically, morally, and strategically.'
Sanders called for a "humanitarian pause" to the fighting last week, but only after Secretary of State Antony Blinken made a similar demand.
The senator voiced his strongest criticism of the Israeli offensive on Monday, but he stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.
"The US provides $3.8 billion a year to Israel," Sanders wrote in a social media post.
"The Biden administration and Congress must make it clear. Israel has the right to defend itself and destroy Hamas terrorism, but it does not have the right to use US dollars to kill thousands of innocent men, women, and children in Gaza."
In 2016, Sanders — an independent senator from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats — defied the odds and mounted a competitive primary challenge against Clinton. Four years later, he led the race for the Democratic nomination until several   dropped out and threw their support behind Biden, who would go on to win the presidency.
Throughout his two presidential campaigns, Sanders led a surging progressive movement in US politics that adopted the Palestinian issue as a core tenet of its agenda.
Questioning US backing for Israel on the presidential campaign trail — where candidates often compete to show their pro-Israel bona fides — remains rare. It showed Sanders to be a candidate willing to defy the political consensus, a quality that appealed to many younger voters.
Domestically, Sanders centred his platform on combatting economic inequality. But his outsider approach to politics extended to foreign policy as well. He said he would impose human rights conditions on US aid to Israel, a proposal Biden dismissed as "bizarre" during the 2020 race.
Sanders, who identifies as Jewish, has also long decried the humanitarian crisis in the besieged Gaza Strip, describing it as "unsustainable" and "unacceptable". He has also referred to Netanyahu as a "reactionary racist".
Arab communities
Sanders's message at the time resonated deeply with Arab and Muslim American communities, who rallied   and helped him win the Michigan Democratic primary in 2016, in one of the race's largest upsets.
But the senator's current unwillingness to call for a ceasefire has left many of his Palestinian, Arab and Muslim supporters with a sense of disappointment if not betrayal.
Omar Baddar, a Palestinian American analyst who supported Sanders's 2020 presidential campaign, said it is "hard to convey the depth of the disappointment" he feels over the senator's failure to back a ceasefire.
"I know the political climate in the US at the moment is scary, anti-Palestinian and intolerant of dissent, but that's precisely why Sanders's voice would be so valuable," Baddar told Al Jazeera. If Sanders speaks out, Baddar believes his actions will "create the political space" for others to do the same.
Baddar also played down Sanders's call for a "pause" in the fighting. Pausing "the slaughter of civilians in Gaza is not a moral position", he said, stressing that the fighting must end.
"Those who oppose a full ceasefire are under the delusional impression that Israel can achieve peace or stability through mass violence, ignoring the fact that Israeli brutality towards Palestinians is precisely why we're in a situation where no one is safe," Baddar told Al Jazeera.
"Even in the unlikely scenario that Israel is able to  , the sheer horror it is inflicting on the people of Gaza will undoubtedly produce the next generation of militants who will want to seek vengeance against Israel."
Arab community 'shaken to its core'
Amer Zahr, a Palestinian American comedian and activist who campaigned for Sanders in Arab communities across the country, also voiced dismay at the senator's stance.
"After the massive support Bernie received from Arab, Muslim and Palestinian Americans in 2016 and 2020, we would have expected he would have been one of the first to urge an immediate ceasefire," Zahr told Al Jazeera.
"His failure to do so is an affront. His voice could open the door for many others to say the same. To call his actions, or lack thereof, a massive disappointment would be understating the hurt."
Sanders's Senate office did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment by the time of publication.
Suehaila Amen, an Arab American advocate in Michigan, said she was "flabbergasted" by Sanders's position, adding that the Arab community at large is "extremely disappointed" in the senator.
"The community is truly shaken to its core that no one has actually stood up from the administration — or those who we have supported in the past on their presidential runs — and said: This must come to an end. This must stop," Amen told Al Jazeera.
"That you can't even ask for a ceasefire is absolutely disgusting and beyond me – when you're watching in   being pulled out of the rubble."
Nour Ali, a Michigan activist, also recalled the excitement Sanders's presidential campaigns sparked in the state's Arab and Muslim communities, where many Arabic speakers called him "Ammo" or "Uncle" Bernie.
"This has left many of us to reckon with who we have decided to support politically in the past. While the Republican Party is outright in their Islamophobia, many Arab and Muslim Americans are realising that the Democratic Party — both moderates and progressives — have used us as a talking point," Ali told Al Jazeera.

2026 World Cup qualifier: Football 'can bring joy' to Lebanon amid Gaza war

November 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Lebanon begin their qualification journey for the 2026 FIFA World Cup as the shadow of war looms large for them, as well as  .
Under normal circumstances, Lebanese fans would gather in Beirut to cheer their heroes on towards North America and, perhaps, a first-ever appearance on the global stage.
However, these are not normal times. The Cedars kick off their campaign against opponents whose homeland faces  , leading to the   since the war began on October 7.
Amid concerns that the devastating conflict could spread to Lebanon, the game has been switched from Beirut to Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.
For the first time, the World Cup in 2026 will feature at least eight teams from Asia instead of the usual four. As Lebanon made it to the final 12 teams in the qualification round in 2022, it would not need a huge improvement for them to knock on the doors of football's big stage.
'This game could not be played in Lebanon so, unfortunately, it is best that it is where it is right now,' Wael Chehayeb, a member of the Lebanese Football Association's executive committee, told Al Jazeera.
'Everyone hopes that the war doesn't expand here [Lebanon] as they can't afford it.'
Football can bring joy
Years of mismanagement and allegations of serious corruption from political leaders have seen Lebanon's economy come close to collapse.
The massive   resulted in at least 218 deaths, injuries to 7,000 others and left more than 300,000 people homeless. It also caused an estimated $3.8-4.6bn  in material damage.
It symbolised the general malaise in the country, where the currency has hit historic lows, power blackouts are the norm and inflation has hit hard, leading to public distrust in the government.
'There is the economic crisis and add that to the war in the south, which might extend to more areas, people are frightened seeing what's happening in Gaza and the West Bank,' said Chehayeb.
Chehayebsays that, in such difficult times, football can be a source of unity and hope.
The country erupted in joyous celebrations when Lebanon defeated the mighty South Korea in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers.
Getting to, or even close to, the World Cup would be a monumental achievement for the country of almost six million.
'The Lebanese people are in a state of worry and uncertainty, so national team's victories could bring joy to many,' he said.
In the last few months under coach Nikola Jurcevic, the Croatian who was appointed last year, Lebanon have looked to move away from the pragmatic and defensive style from the 2022 qualification campaign.
A 1-0 win over India in September was sandwiched between three narrow defeats away to Thailand, Montenegro and the United Arab Emirates, but there are signs that things could improve.
War in Gaza has 'changed everything'
While the Palestinians continue to play while war rages at home, there are worries for Lebanon's players, too.
'Our players are focused on making the final round of qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup as well as the 2027 Asian Cup, but that does not mean they are unaffected [by the war],' Lebanon's national team manager Rachid Nassar told Al Jazeera.
Veteran midfielder Mohamad Haidar is among the most concerned.
The 34-year-old hails from the southern town of Tayr Debba, which is closer to the border with Israel than the capital, Beirut, and hence is susceptible to an Israeli invasion from the south.
Apart from the obvious concern for family and friends, Haidar is concerned about business interests in Beirut which involve playing areas and an academy.
'There is concern about the project and the source of our livelihood,' Haidar said, adding that thesituation in Gaza has "changed everything".
"It's different and the anxiety is greater, but we will do everything we can to try and shine a light in the darkness and make the Lebanese people happy,' he said.
'Lebanon and Palestine are equal'
While the country could do with some sporting success to lift the spirits, the entire football set-up in Lebanon needs the national team to perform well.
As the general economy has faltered, the sport's financial fortunes have followed and, domestically, there is little money available.
Local football officials told Al Jazeera that the Lebanese federation was able to support clubs financially after the pandemic with revenue generated from the exploits of the national team and their extended run in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.
Lebanon reached the final round, which meant 10 extra lucrative games against heavyweights such as Iran and South Korea and extra prize money from FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation.
'It's obvious that the economic crisis affects all sports,' said Rachid.
'The Lebanese Football Association does not receive any help from the government.'
The situation is far worse now.
Lebanese Premier League games are played in empty stadiums due to security concerns and the last season ended in controversy when a title decider between Al-Ahed and Al-Ansar was halted for at least 15 minutes due to crowd trouble.
It is no surprise then, that players seek alternative sources of revenue as Haidar has.
However, the best way for the game and players to make money in the coming months is to go all the way to the World Cup.
In the second round which starts on Thursday, 36 teams have been divided into nine groups of four. The top two from each group will advance to the final round where 18 teams will compete for eight automatic World Cup places.
Lebanon and Palestine are grouped together with Australia and Bangladesh.
Australia, ranked 27th in the world, are expected to be in the lead and   (ranked 183rd) could languish at the bottom, barring major upsets.
It could leave Lebanon (ranked 104th) and Palestine (ranked 96th) competing for the second spot.
A win in Sharjah would be a big step towards the final round.
'I think Lebanon and Palestine are about equal,' Palestine's head coach Makram Daboub told Al Jazeera.
'If we can win this game then it will really help our chances of going to the next stage but we know that Lebanon are thinking the same. It will be a difficult game for both teams.'

'Silent annexation' :Settlers dispossess West Bank Bedouins amid Israel war

October 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
On the morning of October 12, the men of Wadi al-Siq were dismantling their family homes when a group of heavily armed Israelis from nearby illegal settlements – alongside army reservists – stormed the village.
Their wives and most of their children had vacated the village, driving a few of the Palestinian Bedouin village's sheep ahead of them, the day before. They were all frightened.
Israeli peace activist Guy Hirschfeld had warned on Facebook two days prior of a   call for the massacre of the Wadi al-Siq community. So the village, led by their mukhtar, Abdelrahman 'Abu Bashar' Kaabneh, decided to leave.
Translation: Final preparations for pogrom and deportation at Wadi Sik near Rimonim settlement. Please call the Benjamin police and ask for troops to be sent. 02-9706444Stop ethnic cleansing!
Wadi al-Siq is among the Palestinian Bedouin villages in the occupied West Bank that are being forcibly displaced in a tide that has grown these past two weeks, according to rights organisations.
Heavily armed Israelis from illegal settlements attack these communities on a daily basis – concentrated, organised attacks that go unimpeded and sometimes aided by security forces, according to witnesses and human rights organisations.
While this has happened for years, it has increased in intensity and frequency as the world looks away, focused on the horror of the Israel-Gaza war that began on October 7.
'It's all over the West Bank,' said Hirschfeld, who was in the area four or five times since the start of the war. '[The settlers are] taking advantage of the situation and doing whatever they want.'
Leave today, or live and die this way
A north-south stretch of 20km (12.4 miles) east of Ramallah is being cleared of nearly all Palestinians, pushing an already fraught security situation for Bedouins in these remote areas to a breaking point.
Area C – a stretch of the occupied West Bank under Israeli security and civil control – has seen about 545 Palestinians forcibly displaced from at least 13 communities since October 7, according to information from the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC) and Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din.
The land is nominally earmarked to be negotiated over in future talks, according to the  , signed by Israel and the PLO in 1993.
(Al Jazeera)
The violence stretches across Area C, including the South Hebron Hills, the area east of Ramallah towards Jericho, the Jordan Valley, and Nablus.
Witnesses and humanitarian coordinators say more communities are leaving or have begun dismantling their villages and leaving for Area B, rather than meet the same fate as Wadi al-Siq, the first village to have been entirely depopulated by settlers since October 7.
Armed settlers, nearly all wielding guns, stage violent incursions while Israeli law enforcement seems content to look the other way, villagers and human rights organisations told Al Jazeera.
Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has been distributing even more guns  to well-armed Israeli settlers  since hostilities broke out on October 7.
'We have nothing'
Wadi al-Siq, a village of 187 Bedouins – its houses barely more than shacks perched on hardscrabble rocky ground, is in the barren mountains east of Ramallah that have been populated by Palestinian shepherds for decades.
Nearby Ein Samiya was the   by settler violence earlier this year and, along with recently displaced villages al-Baqa and Ras al-Tin, was a chilling vision of the future for Wadi al-Siq.
Some families had left Wadi al-Siq earlier in the year to seek safety from settler attacks on them, their property and even their school. But, since the outbreak of war, the situation deteriorated sharply, with villagers speaking of nearby settlers terrorising them daily.
The villagers of Wadi al-Siq had already gathered their things to leave [Al Jazeera]
That fateful October day, the armed settlers and reservists fired one shot into the air and told the villagers that they would be killing any Bedouins still around in an hour.
'They entered the houses and prevented us from taking anything,' Abu Bashar said, adding that they dragged out all the Bedouins they found and beat them.
'They told us: 'If any of you are in this area in an hour, you'll be killed,'' he said.
The villagers ran, fleeing with little but the clothes they were wearing. According to Abu Bashar, about 30 villagers were injured either from the attack or while fleeing into the nearby mountains.
'We have no food. No water. No electricity. Nowhere to sleep. We have nothing,' said Abu Bashar over the phone, the sound of harsh winds blowing in the background.
Since they were forced out, villagers reported seeing settlers looting their former homes. With nothing left to live off, many of the villagers have resorted to begging, Abu Bashar said.
'What's happening to us is exactly what happened to our ancestors in 1948 who were forced to leave with nothing,' said Abu Bashar, referring to the 1948 Nakba, when most Palestinians were expelled from their homeland.
The Wadi al-Siq villagers are desperately calling for international assistance to at least create a two-hour humanitarian corridor so they can gather their belongings.

However, with the region in chaos, their calls are going unheeded, according to Abu Bashar and humanitarian organisations.
'No protection at all'
The panic among Palestinian Bedouin communities is growing.
Their area, now all but emptied of Palestinians, had received donations and support in recent years from EU missions who saw the Bedouin communities as integral to the contiguity of a future Palestinian state.
But now, the pattern seen in Wadi al-Siq – closing access roads followed by concentrated attacks and forced displacement – is happening elsewhere in Area C, where the population of 300,000 is outnumbered by the 400,000 heavily armed Israeli settlers.
Since the outbreak of war, the Bedouin communities across Area C have been left with essentially no protection as even the activists who monitored and supported them were cut off.
In Wadi al-Siq, three Palestinian volunteers from the Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission who were monitoring the situation were so badly beaten by the settlers that they had to be hospitalised, according to witnesses and a Commission representative.
Israeli activists at the scene were also beaten and restrained. 'All the leftists are traitors,' one of the Israeli settlers in military apparel said during the attack, overheard by one of the activists. 'I think we need to kill them all.'
The armed Israelis took everyone's phones, deleting any videos or photos of the attack.
With checkpoints closed and roads too dangerous to pass, foreign missions and humanitarian organisations have been unable to reach the villages of Area C.
'They have no protection at all,' said Dror Sadot, spokesperson for Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem. 'So the settlers, of course, know that.'
Calls for 'elimination' and 'expulsion' are becoming commonplace in settler chat groups, fuelled by rhetoric from political leaders like Ben-Gvir applauding violence towards Palestinians.
'The roads … are closed to the movement of the Arab enemy, there won't be olive picking in the area, and no enemy can come near you,' declared one post in a settler chat group, which directed settlers to keep at least 100 bullets and full cartridges and to 'liquidate/wipe out' any approaching Palestinians.
The gradual encirclement of Bedouin villages by settler shepherding outposts over the past years is now making travel between the villages all but impossible.
'The army has a strong hand on the trigger - a pedestrian or a vehicle that goes out into the street will die immediately!'' said one post in a settler chat group. 'And that's how it should be.'
No discernible action is being taken to address the rising threat of violence by Israeli authorities.

'Everyone knows what their agenda is. They know who they are. They could stop it. That's not happening as far as we know,' said Allegra Pacheco, chief of party for the WBPC.
The Israeli army did not respond to requests for comment.
'Empty of any Palestinian people'
Reports of attacks and deaths at the hands of soldiers and settlers are rising at a rate not seen in years, with Reuters confirming at least 64 Palestinians killed in the occupied West Bank since October 7.
A video emerged recently of a settler entering the village of al-Tawani in the South Hebron Hills, approaching a Palestinian man and shooting him at point-blank range as Israeli soldiers looked on.
In Sair al-Ganoub, three families were displaced when their homes were burned down by settlers.
'I received phone calls from more than 20 communities giving me the same message: We're scared the settlers will come and massacre us,' said a humanitarian coordinator in Area C, who wished to remain anonymous due to employer rules.
According to Yesh Din and the WBPC, a partnership of European states and NGOs seeking to prevent the forcible transfer of Palestinians, reports are coming in of Bedouins forced to flee their communities under threat of force across Area C.

In the communities of Ein al-Rashash and Mughayar al-Deir, located along the same corridor as Wadi al-Siq and formerly Ein Samiya, Ras al-Tin and al-Baqa, villagers were warned by security guards from the nearby settlements of Rimonim and Ma'ale Michmash that they should leave before they are killed.
Ein al-Rashash has now been dismantled completely, most of the inhabitants of Mu'arrajat Center have left, and East Taybe Bedouin families have moved closer to Area B.
Mughayar al-Deir is the only Palestinian community that remains in the entire area, with forced displacement likely there as well.
Families have also fled under duress in other areas, including Khirbat al-Radhim, al-Farsia, al-Nusira, and Ain al-Shibli, according to Yesh Din.
'By forcing out all these communities, all of this area from Jericho and east of Ramallah will become empty of any Palestinian people. It will become a huge area for the settlers and their expansion,' said the humanitarian coordinator. 'It's a silent annexation.'
'The settler violence is not separate from state violence. It's an unofficial arm of the state to take over Palestinian land,' said Sadot of B'Tselem.
'That was their plan before, and it is the plan right now. So, of course, they're exploiting the fact that no one is looking at them at this moment to take over Palestinian land en masse.'

Gaza has lost more than 60 percent of its jobs since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the United Nations labour agency has said, warning that the economic fallout will reverberate for "many years to come".
The Palestinian territory's estimated employment losses are equivalent to 182,000 jobs, the International Labour Organization said on Monday in an assessment of the economic impact of the conflict.
'Our initial assessment of the repercussions of the tragic current crisis on the Palestinian labour market have yielded extremely worrying results, which will only worsen if the conflict continues,' said Ruba Jaradat, the ILO's Regional Director for Arab States.
'The ongoing hostilities not only represent an enormous humanitarian crisis in terms of loss of lives and basic human needs, they also represent a social and economic crisis which has caused vast damage to jobs and businesses, with reverberations that will be felt for many years to come.'
The occupied West Bank has also lost an estimated 24 percent of its employment, the equivalent of 208,000 jobs, due to spillover effects of the war, the ILO said.
When combined, job losses in the two Palestinian territories translate into estimated daily income losses of $16m, according to the UN agency.
Jaradat said residents in Gaza must be allowed 'full, rapid, safe, and unhindered' access to humanitarian aid.
'We are working tirelessly with government, worker and employer partners, other UN agencies and humanitarian actors to provide immediate assistance to impacted workers and businesses,' she said.
'We will also support them in the longer term towards collecting vital labour market information and recovering jobs and enterprises, combined with social protection initiatives, to the utmost extent of our mandate.'
Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade since 2005, suffered from severe economic deprivation even before the start of the latest conflict.
Unemployment in the territory stood at 46.4 percent in the second quarter of 2023, one of the highest rates in the world.
More than 80 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the UN.
Shortages of food, water and medical supplies have worsened since Israel tightened its blockade and began bombarding the enclave after Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israeli communities, which officials say killed at least 1,405 people, mostly civilians.
At least 10,022 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's bombardment since then, according to officials in the Hamas-governed enclave.

Liverpool star Mohamed Salah calls for end to 'massacres' in Gaza

Egypt and Liverpool footballer Mohamed Salah has called for an end to "massacres" in Gaza, saying humanitarian aid must immediately be allowed into the besieged Palestinian enclave.
The 31-year-old forward made his first comments on the deepening Israel-Gaza conflict on Wednesday amid growing outrage over the deaths of nearly 500 people in an   in Gaza City.
Palestinian authorities say the blast was caused by an Israeli air raid. Israel says the explosion was the result of a rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) armed group misfiring. The PIJ has rejected the allegation.
"It is not always easy to speak in a time like this. There has been too much violence and too much heartbreak and brutality," Salah said in a video posted to his 62.7 million followers on Instagram.
The footballer, who captains Egypt's national team, had been criticised for not speaking up in defence of Palestinians, and some critics had started an online campaign to unfollow him on social media.
"The escalations in recent weeks is unbearable to witness. All lives are sacred and must be protected. The massacres need to stop, families are being torn apart."
A Champions League and Premier League winner with Liverpool, Salah is one of the most popular athletes in the Arab world.
Gaza has been   since October 7 when Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack on Israel killing some 1,400 people and taking others captive. Israel declared war in response, subjecting the territory of 2.3 million people to relentless bombardment. Some 3,480 Palestinians have been confirmed killed in the attacks.
US President Joe Biden flew to Tel Aviv on Wednesday and said Israel had agreed to his request to allow   amid mounting concern about dwindling supplies and warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe.
The enclave had already been struggling under a 16-year Israeli blockade.
Egypt has said it will allow 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza through the Rafah crossing in the territory's south.
"What is clear now is that humanitarian aid to Gaza must be allowed immediately. The people there are in terrible conditions," Salah added.
"The scenes at the   last night were horrifying. The people of Gaza need food, water and medical supplies urgently.
"I am calling on world leaders to come together to prevent further slaughter of innocent souls – humanity must prevail."

How Israel will stage its land incursion into Gaza

Israel is getting ready to attack and Palestinian fighters are preparing to defend  . Both sides are determined and experienced and both have announced that they will ultimately prevail.
Leaving aside for the moment the very important question of what would constitute victory for either of the warring sides, it is pertinent at this point to examine their respective approach to the  .
Every commander tries to make best use of his strengths and enemy's weaknesses, the Israeli army and   are no different. They know each other from past clashes, and both have extensive combat experience. It is almost certain that both were given access to intelligence and recent experiences by their friends and allies.
Equipment, numbers and determination
What are Israeli forces' strengths? First and foremost an overwhelming superiority in trained and well-equipped  , with half a million currently in uniform and deployed all over Israel and the occupied West Bank.
Palestinian resistance in Gaza can probably only muster 10,000 fighters with proper training and weapons suited to the specialised tasks their groups will perform. That could easily grow up to 100,000 volunteers willing to fight but, without proper tactical training and equipment, they will lean heavily on their will and determination.
The   will rely on superiority in quantity and quality of equipment, better and more specialised training, discipline, clearly defined lines of command, combat flexibility and coordination in all sections of the battlefield and tactical surprise by employing new approaches and new weapons.
Against them, the Palestinian resistance looks much weaker on paper, but they may possess intense perseverance and dedication to defend their homeland.
What also counts in their favour is the fact that they are fighting on home ground where they know every corner, building, roof and heap of rubble. Finally,   that Hamas dug over the years under Gaza are an extremely strong defensive asset.
Only Israeli top military and civilian commanders know the details of the attack plan and the timing, but it is possible to predict the main lines of Israeli action: The all-out attack is almost certain to start at night. Most Israeli soldiers have been issued night-vision goggles and have trained to use them to see in the dark. Much more importantly, Israeli aerial assets, manned aeroplanes, helicopters and pilotless drones can also operate in total darkness.
Palestinian defenders certainly have some night-vision equipment but not the capability to target and hit flying assets at night except possibly for an odd lucky shot at a low-flying helicopter. Due to the narrowness of the Strip, most Israeli bombers will be able to launch their deadly payloads from outside Gazan airspace – above Israeli territory on the eastern side and above the Mediterranean Sea on the western side.
Smart bombs can glide for distances sufficient to keep the aircraft out of reach of very few, limited-capability, anti-aircraft launchers that defenders are believed to have.
The horseshoe-shaped airspace on the west, north and east of the Gaza Strip will be brimming with Israeli aircraft. Minutes before forces move in, converted civilian Gulfstream and Super King Air aircraft of the Israeli air force will start blocking communications with electronic counter-measures.
Electronic interference will render mobile phones inoperable, and communications towers will be targeted in the first wave of bombing. Other communications, including land-based internet and telephone lines will be electronically jammed and made unusable.
Coordinated land and sea attacks will follow, coming from multiple directions all at the same time, likely around midnight. This will give attackers six hours of night-vision advantage at a time when most of the Arab world and Europe is asleep and the American continent prepares to wrap up the day.
  will go through the separation wall Israel built around Gaza with ubiquitous armoured bulldozers breaching the barriers, digging up and shoving aside anti-tank and anti-personnel mines that the Palestinian fighters probably laid. They will be flanked by Merkava tanks and dismounted infantry, and followed by infantry companies in armoured personnel carriers. The initial objective will be reaching built-up areas before dawn as the Israelis will want to see daylight from fortified defendable positions when the expected first Hamas counterattacks happen.
Knowing Israeli military thinking, the main objective of the first night of invasion would probably be to surround Gaza City and cut it off from the south of the Strip, to prevent the resupply of Palestinian fighters. The terrain lends itself to this possibility, with the area south of   being mostly farms, with no major buildings.
To achieve that, the Israeli forces would attack westwards from Israel from the direction of the ANZAC Monument and use a classic military pincer tactic to ensure success.
On the opposite side of forces moving from the desert across Gaza Strip, Israel might, in a tactical and operational innovation, use naval infantry landing on the beaches and deploying over them into the empty fields.

'Unsafe in own home': Israeli settlers spread terror in South Hebron Hills

November 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Khirbet Zanuta, occupied West Bank — Amin Hamed al-Hadhrat took a break from taking down his family's home in the South Hebron Hills, crying. 'I know in a day or two I'm going to live somewhere else, but I still can't imagine it happening,' the 37-year-old said. 'All I know is living here. All my father knew was living here. I don't know what it is like to live anywhere else.'
This week, al-Hadhrat's village of shepherds, Khirbet Zanuta, joined the growing swell of Palestinian Bedouin villages forcibly emptied since October 7 due to violent attacks from armed Israeli settlers often wearing Israeli military uniforms.
Khirbet Zanuta is located in the South Hebron Hills region in Area C of the occupied West Bank, which is under full Israeli military control. The founding of Meitarim Farm, an Israeli outpost located 100 metres away on the next hill, in 2021 had made life hard for the community, according to residents. Settler violence prevented the shepherds from allowing their livestock to graze.
Such attacks have escalated dramatically since October 7, say Palestinian villagers, Israeli activists and international organisations. The United Nations has said that the daily rate of settler violence incidents in the West Bank has more than doubled, up from three to an average of seven in this period. And while the Gaza Strip has borne the brunt of Israel's devastating bombardment since the Hamas attack on southern Israel, with more than 9,000 Palestinians killed in the besieged enclave, attacks by settlers and Israeli forces have also killed   in the West Bank.
Settlers usually come in the night, destroying water tanks, piping and electrical systems; breaking windows and cars. Most alarming to Khirbet Zanuta residents was when armed settlers began entering homes to beat Palestinian shepherds. On October 27, settlers told residents that if they did not leave in 24 hours, they would be killed.
'There's a difference between feeling unsafe when you go grazing and feeling unsafe even in your own home,' said al-Hadhrat. Worried for the safety of their children and themselves, the community decided they must leave.
So this past week, the dusty village of 150 people took down their hardscrabble homes made of tin or stones, packing their belongings onto pick-up trucks, bit by bit. While the adults were busy packing haystacks and iron rods, sorting through flour and animal feed, a little girl sat on the barren ground, playing with pebbles. A boy attempted to pick up iron bars to pitch in. Another child simply sat on a rock, wiping tears from his eyes.
All the while, drones launched by nearby settlers buzzed above the village, surveilling the dismantlement.

'We can't sleep'
Sameh, a man in his early 40s, took a break to smoke a cigarette. His little girl, Deema, sat on his lap, swinging her legs back and forth. They were trying to stay in good spirits.
Sameh had decided to bring his family to the edge of a nearby town, he explained. 'We will walk [by foot] for one or two hours over the mountains to avoid settler attacks on the road,' he said.
But each moment leading up to their departure grew heavier. 'We can't eat. We can't sleep. We can't think right now,' he said.
Without any specific place to go to, the community is splitting up to seek refuge in different places – and,  , their shepherding way of life will likely be impossible to continue.
Al-Hadhrat reminisced of spending long nights with friends on their quiet, windswept hill underneath the stars, drinking coffee and sharing stories. 'It's hard to imagine how we will keep in touch. Maybe we'll see each other in the market or something,' he mused. His bloodshot eyes grew even glossier. 'It's so difficult to think that the community is breaking apart. I don't think we will be able to stay in touch in a meaningful way.'

A domino effect
Khirbet Zanuta is only the latest   that's been wiped off the West Bank landscape since October 7 — and it won't be the last. As al-Hadhrat and his community packed up, the village of A'Nizan down the road decided they would dismantle their homes, too. Though facing attacks while grazing, they had not yet received the kinds of home attacks Amin and others had endured these past few weeks. But A'Nizan's 35 inhabitants knew that Khirbet Zanuta's departure meant they were next in the settlers' crosshairs.
According to the latest figures provided by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), at least 864 Palestinians, including 333 children, have been forcibly displaced as a result of attacks from Israeli settlers in this period, with 11 communities fully displaced and another 11 communities at least partially forcibly transferred. Almost half of at least 186 violent settler incidents resulting in casualties or property damage have been in the presence of, or supported by, Israeli forces. Settlers have used weapons in almost a third of these incidents.
This rate of displacement has not been seen since the removal of thousands of Bedouins from areas in the Sinai peninsula in 1972 by Israel. The concentration of forcible displacement that began in the remote area east of Ramallah has now spread to the South Hebron Hills, abutting the border between the southern West Bank and Israel proper.
Unlike the communities displaced in the area east of Ramallah recently, communities of the South Hebron Hills often live on privately owned land. They have tighter local networks, with ties to international organisations and solidarity groups, making it harder for them to be dislodged from their properties.
But settler attacks have only intensified in their bid to remove this rural yet strategically important area — which allows the maintenance of a contiguous Palestinian presence on both sides of the Green Line, which divides Israel from the West Bank.
Since the war started, many of the regular Israeli soldiers patrolling the region have gone to Gaza, replaced by settlers from nearby settlements and outposts in uniform. As Yehuda Shaul, a former Israeli military commander and co-founder of Breaking the Silence, an Israeli NGO comprising dissenting army veterans, explained, these settlers come from local regional defence units: typically the first-response teams of settlements.
'You have settlers that, half a year ago, came and beat [Palestinians] up as civilians, and now they are in [military] uniform with guns, and they come to beat you up,' said Shaul. 'And you don't know: is this part of their military assignment? Or are they just doing it in their free time?'

'Closing their eyes'
Whatever the answer, these attacks are bringing the settlers' longstanding goals to fruition, say activists and affected communities.
'For years, the settlers have been pressuring the state to expel Palestinians from Area C,' said Nasser Nawajeh, the spokesperson of the village of Susiya and the South Hebron Hills field researcher for Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem. 'Now, they are just doing it themselves. Even if the state doesn't send them to do that, the army and authorities are closing their eyes and acting like it doesn't happen.'
In the village of Jinba, settlers were filmed forcefully taking down the speakers of their mosque. In the village of Um al-Khair, a settler in uniform drove through the village aiming his weapon at anyone who dared to be on the street or on their balcony, demanding they go inside the house. On October 27, said Nawajeh, two settlers in military uniforms stopped a car full of Palestinians in Um al-Khair, forced them out of the car, and shot the car's engine and its windows.
Three days later, settlers returned to the village, collecting all the men at gunpoint, forcing them to stand along a wall and checking their phones. When they saw photos of a Palestinian policeman in uniform and with a gun, they attacked him. After finding a local activist, they forced him at gunpoint to make statements against his will on film. Um al-Khair was also given a 24-hour ultimatum to vacate.
Settlers have come to the village of Tuba on different days to destroy the village's electrical and water systems and vandalise homes. On October 30, settlers came to the village of Sfai, setting houses on fire.
While some attacks are documented with videos or photos, Bedouins across Area C describe far more incidents that go undocumented. In recent weeks, numerous accounts describe settlers and those in military uniforms confiscating Palestinians' phones, deleting any photos or videos of settler attacks. In Tuba, settlers even set a Palestinian's phone on fire.

Leave In 24 Hours, or be killed
On October 28, the  , less than a kilometre from the Green Line, was attacked. Settlers told the villagers they must leave in 24 hours, or they would be killed.
'They basically come, they assault, they attack, and when you try to speak to them, they tell you to shut up,' said Nawajeh. 'Then, before they leave, they give you the ultimatum.'
Despite the attacks and threats, the villagers of Susiya say they will remain on their land. The village has grown over the years to become a symbol of "sumud", or steadfastness. They've faced physical attacks on themselves, their homes, water sources, livestock and agriculture from settlers. But they have refused to move.
That profile has brought international solidarity visits to Susiya for years, with the European Union Foreign Affairs Council declaring in 2015 that the   by Israeli authorities would be a red line that must not be crossed.
Since October 7, however, villagers in Susiya report being attacked and threatened multiple times a day — a new level of assault. Like nearly all other Bedouin villages in Area C, the army blocked the entrance to the village, preventing them from going to the nearby city of Yatta to get supplies. The contractor hired by the military to set up these roadblocks — a local settler named Yinon Levy, who runs the Meitarim Farm that violently forced the displacement of villagers from Khirbet Zanuta – decided to also destroy water cisterns and crops, while sealing a cave used by a family, according to Nawajeh. In some cases, he said, settlers in military uniforms have forced his neighbours out of their cars, confiscating their keys.
This week, a letter signed by 30 Israeli human rights and civil society NGOs, including Amnesty International Israel, B'Tselem, Haqel, Ir Amim, Kerem Navot, Rabbis for Human Rights and Yesh Din, declared that 'the Israeli government is supportive of these attacks and does nothing to stop this violence'.
'The only way to stop the forcible transfer in the West Bank,' the NGOs concluded, 'is a clear, strong and direct intervention by the international community.'
So far, no such intervention seems to be on the horizon. Nonetheless, the 24-hour ultimatum has passed, and Susiya still remains. Several Israeli activists have stayed with the community to offer protection and support, though they are unlikely to be able to physically resist heavily armed settlers.
Meanwhile, the villagers cherish the peaceful moments they still have. One morning this week, an Israeli woman dressed as a clown blew bubbles with a little girl to take her mind off the attacks.
Mohammad Nawajeh, Nasser's father and village elder, looked on at the little girl playing. 'Our future is here,' he declared defiantly. 'We will not leave.'

Dozens of Palestinians have been killed in Israeli air raids while trying to flee the northern Gaza Strip, according to Hamas officials, after the Israeli military ordered more than one million residents to evacuate in a demand rejected by the United Nations as "impossible".
The media office of Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs the besieged Gaza Strip, said 70 people, mostly women and children, were killed in the air raids on cars leaving Gaza City. It said the vehicles were targeted in three places.
Thousands of Palestinian civilians began to flee to southern Gaza on Friday under a relentless barrage of air strikes after the   order although there were few signs of a mass exodus.
Israeli Defence Minister   said any Palestinian who wants to 'save their lives' must heed the order to move south as Israel prepares for an expected ground assault on the besieged coastal enclave.
About 1.1 million of Gaza's 2.3 million people live in the northern part of the strip, which includes Gaza City, the most populated urban area.
Several rights groups have denounced the order and warned that a potential forced transfer of the civilian population would be a violation of international law.
Many Palestinians said they would not heed the order.
'The feeling is that there is no hope, that no one cares about Gaza or what's happening to the people,' Gaza resident Mansour Shouman told Al Jazeera on Friday.
'If we're going to die here, we're going to die in our homes. We're going to die in the north or the south. We're going to die with our heads up high, standing on our lands, standing with our rights and holding strong to our faith.'
The Gaza Ministry of Health said on Friday that at least 1,800 people — more than half of them women or people under the age of 18 — have been killed as Israel pounds the strip with air strikes that have levelled entire neighbourhoods.
Hamas has told people to stay put, and many of the enclave's residents already believe there is nowhere safe they can go.
"The noose around the civilian population in Gaza is tightening. How are 1.1 million people supposed to move across a densely populated war zone in less than 24 hours?" UN aid chief Martin Griffiths wrote on social media.
'Despite the occupation's threats to shell; the decision has been made. We have not left and will not leave,' the medical organisation Palestinian Red Crescent said in a social media post. 'Our medics will carry on their humanitarian duties. We won't leave people to face death alone.'
Israeli ground raids
An Israeli military spokesman said Israeli soldiers and tanks on Friday conducted their first ground raids into Gaza since Hamas fighters carried out a devastating attack on southern Israel on Saturday, killing at least 1,300 people and injuring more than 3,000.
More than 100 people, including Israelis and foreigners, are also being held captive by Hamas.
Israeli authorities say the soldiers in the initial raids targeted Palestinian rocket crews and tried to gain information about the captives. The small-scale operations are a likely prelude to an anticipated  .
Hospitals overwhelmed, given hours to evacuate
A combination of Israeli air raids and an Israeli siege that has cut off access to water, electricity, food and fuel has devastated health facilities in the beleaguered strip, where   now say they face impossible choices under the evacuation orders.
The international medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, issued a statement on Friday saying Israeli authorities had given it just two hours to evacuate a hospital in northern Gaza.
'Our staff are still  . We unequivocally condemn this action, the continued indiscriminate bloodshed and attacks on health care in Gaza. We are trying to protect our staff and patients,' the group said in a social media post.

In a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Jordan on Friday, Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority (PA), based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, said the forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza would constitute a repeat of 1948 when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee from their homes in what is now Israel. Most Gazans are the descendants of such refugees.
  later stopped in the Qatari capital, Doha, where he said the US had called on Israel to take 'every possible precaution' to avoid harming civilians.
Blinken shuttled among Saudi, Jordanian and other Arab leaders on Friday after meeting with Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv the day before. He heard Arab demands for aid corridors to be opened for the Palestinians trapped in Gaza and fears that any Israeli ground offensive could push countless Gaza residents into their countries.

Israeli forces have targeted the solar panel system at a building in the al-Shifa Hospital complex, the Gaza Strip's largest hospital, which is already on the brink of collapse with fuel, water and medicines running out.
Reporting from Khan Younis in Gaza, Al Jazeera's Tareq Abou Azzoum said Israel's relentless bombardment has continued to escalate in the north and central areas of the besieged enclave.
"This time, they [Israeli forces] have destroyed the solar panels installed on the rooftop of the al-Shifa Hospital building," Abou Azzoum said.
"This is a clear attack that destroyed the solar panels that provide electricity to the main departments of the hospital. This will exacerbate the current situation at al-Shifa Hospital with the ongoing crisis with fuel running out at the hospital.
"This will stop the provision of other services as well, including water for the thousands of people residing at this complex," he added.
The Palestinian Al-Aqsa Radio also confirmed reports about the hospital's solar panel system being struck by Israel.

Targeting hospitals
Israel has   in the Gaza Strip as the conflict moved into its fourth week.
On Sunday, the lack of fuel and large numbers of wounded Palestinians arriving at al-Shifa Hospital, resulted in its maternity ward being transferred to the private al-Helou International Hospital. The area near al-Shifa also saw   on Sunday.
Earlier that day, an Israeli attack hit near Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, wounding at least 14 people and damaging the building.
Hospitals and ambulances have been targeted several times since the Israeli attacks began on October 7, killing patients, displaced civilians sheltering at the facilities as well as health workers.
According to the World Health Organization, 39 health facilities have been damaged since the war began. Hospitals have also been forced to   or cut services after electricity and fuel supplies were cut.
At least 10,022 Palestinians, including 4,008 children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the latest war began, Gaza's Ministry of Health said on Monday, as entire neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble. More than 1,400 people were killed in attacks by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7, which started the war.
Nearly 1.5 million people, more than half the population, are now internally displaced in Gaza, according to the United Nations.

Canadian peace activist confirmed dead after going missing in Hamas attacks

Vivian Silver, a Canadian-Israeli peace activist who went missing during Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel, has been confirmed dead, her family have told Canadian media.
Silver, 74, was killed in the Palestinian armed group's initial attacks on southern Israeli communities, Silver's son, Yonatan Zeigen, told CBC News and CTV News on Monday.
He said his mother's remains had been found earlier but were only identified more than five weeks after the attacks.
Silver, the founder of Women Wage Peace and the Arab-Jewish Center for Equality, Empowerment and Cooperation, had been living in Kibbutz Be'eri, near Gaza, after relocating from Winnipeg in the early 1970s.
In an article earlier this month, the Washington Post described Silver as having spent 'her entire adult life denouncing Israel's treatment of Palestinians, lobbying for diplomatic solutions to the conflict, ferrying children from Gaza to Israeli hospitals".
Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly described Silver as a "proud Israeli-Canadian and lifelong advocate for peace".
"I met her son in Tel Aviv, and he described her as kind, generous, and selfless," Joly said on X, formerly Twitter. "Canada mourns her loss with him and her loved ones."
John Lyndon, the executive director of the Washington, DC-based Alliance for Middle East Peace, said Silver had wanted Gaza to be 'free and at peace".
'Rest in power, Vivian,' he said on X.
The Jewish Federation of Winnipeg said it was 'devastated' to learn of Silver's death.
'Vivian was a civilian brutally taken from her home, and now we know, from all of us, forever,' the group said on Facebook.
'She was a renowned pacifist who tirelessly advocated for peace and the improvement of the quality of life for Palestinians. We are with heavy hearts as we learn of the impact of Hamas' terrorist attack and as time passes, to learn of the identity of those massacred in Israel.'
Hamas killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 others captive during the worst attack on Israel in decades, according to Israeli officials.
On Monday, Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing, said the armed group was prepared to release up to 70 women and children held in Gaza in return for a five-day truce, but that Israel was "procrastinating and evading" on the terms of a deal.

'Starvation and disease' stalk Gaza as fuel shortages block aid: Agencies

November 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza faces the threat of starvation and disease after aid deliveries were halted by a lack of fuel and a communications blackout, humanitarian agencies have warned.
Aid deliveries into the enclave have been suspended again as Israel continues to restrict fuel supplies. The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said on Friday that civilians faced the "immediate possibility of starvation". The World Health Organization warned that disease is spreading rapidly.
The halt in deliveries of humanitarian supplies is deepening the misery of hungry and homeless Palestinians as Israel's war drags on.
While Israel has been allowing some aid to cross into Gaza via the Rafah border crossing linking the enclave with Egypt, it has allowed barely any fuel through.
Aid agencies say this is scuppering the distribution of supplies. Palestinian telecommunications companies Jawwal and Paltel   that their networks went out of service after they ran out of fuel. There have been several communications blackouts in Gaza during the Israeli assault.
Aid agencies stress that the delivery of all aid and medical care depends crucially on fuel supplies.
Israel's war cabinet announced on Friday afternoon that it would allow two fuel trucks per day into Gaza 'for UN needs'.
The fuel is intended to provide 'minimal' support for water, sewerage and sanitary systems to prevent pandemics, an official said.
Desperate need
The UN said there would be no cross-border aid operation on Friday due to fuel shortages and the communications shutdown. For a second consecutive day on Thursday, no aid trucks arrived in Gaza due to a lack of fuel for distributing relief.
WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain said nearly the entire population was in desperate need of food assistance.
"Supplies of food and water are practically non-existent in Gaza and only a fraction of what is needed is arriving through the borders," she said in a statement.
"With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation," McCain said.
"Food production has come to an almost complete halt, markets have collapsed, fishermen cannot access the sea, farmers cannot reach their farms," Abeer Etefa, a Middle East regional spokesperson for the WFP said. "People are facing the immediate possibility of starvation."
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization said it was very worried about the spread of disease in Gaza, citing more than 70,000 reported cases of acute respiratory infections and at least 44,000 cases of diarrhoea, far more than expected.
No let-up
With the war about to enter its seventh week, there is no sign of any let-up in Israel's assault and blockade of Gaza, despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.
Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on Friday that at least nine people were killed and others injured in an Israeli strike that hit a group of displaced people near Rafah – the only crossing point for aid.
The Israeli military's chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas's military system in the northern Gaza Strip.
The conflict was triggered by a cross-border raid by Hamas fighters on October 7 that killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians.
More than 11,500 Palestinians, at least 4,700 of them children, have now been killed in Israel's retaliatory military assault on Gaza, according to the enclave's health ministry.
Israel has flattened whole neighbourhoods of Gaza in air and artillery attacks, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, and the humanitarian situation is catastrophic, aid agencies say.

How are Gaza casualty updates affected by Israeli attacks on hospitals?

November 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Ministry of Health in Gaza has been struggling to update casualty figures as Israeli forces have increasingly targeted hospitals and allied services in the besieged enclave.
The United Nations has confirmed that the 'collapse of services and communications' at hospitals in northern Gaza is seriously hampering health officials.
So, when was the last time we got an update, how has the ministry managed its figures so far, and how dire is the situation of hospitals in Gaza?
When was the last update?
On Sunday, the government media office in Gaza updated the casualty figures after a gap of two days. It  , including more than 8,000 children and women. The last official update came on November 10 at 2pm (12:00 GMT).
'Due to the targeting of hospitals and the prevention of entry of any of the bodies or wounded, the Ministry of Health was unable, on Saturday, to issue accurate statistics for the numbers of dead and injured during the past hours,' the media office said in a statement.
The Health Ministry in Gaza has been providing daily updates since the war started following the surprise Hamas attack inside Israel killed about 1,200 people.
Last week, Barbara Leaf, assistant US secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, told a House panel that the number of those killed in Gaza – home to 2.3 million people – is likely 'higher than is being cited'.
The UN relief agency confirmed in its latest update on Saturday that a communications breakdown has prevented new figures from coming in.
Nearly 3,000 Palestinians remain missing and may be trapped or dead under the rubble while another 27,490 Palestinians have reportedly been injured, the Health Ministry said on Friday.
How does the system work?
The Health Ministry had previously explained its methodology for compiling data on Palestinian casualties.
Once a victim who arrives at the emergency department of a government hospital is identified, their data, including ID number and personal information, along with the time of arrival, are recorded in the hospital's computerised information system.
Each hospital also records the cases of death for the wounded who spent a period in the hospital before their death.
The daily   is transferred from the decentralised hospital system to the central database of a government registry.
Non-governmental hospitals use their own forms to record data about the victim as soon as they arrive. Then, these forms are sent to the Health Information Centre at the Ministry of Health within 24 hours for entry into the central database.
The ministry processes the data, verifies its completeness, and ensures there are no duplicates or errors after the transfer is completed.
The ministry's information centre prepares daily reports, which are sent to the government-run Health Emergency Operations Centre for approval and dissemination.
How bad are hospitals in Gaza having it?
Israeli air raids have struck areas in and surrounding hospitals and medical centres across Gaza to devastating effect since the start of the war based on a claim disputed by Palestinians as well as international medical NGOs that Hamas is operating in those areas. Israel has not provided any proof for its claims.
But as Israel's ground offensive has progressed in northern Gaza, its forces  , and the past few days have marked a sharp increase in their targeting.
Israeli  , the largest facility in Gaza, and snipers and drones positioned all around are shooting at people.
A surgeon at the hospital told Al Jazeera on Sunday that an engineer who tried to fix a blackout at the hospital was shot and left paralysed by a drone. He said he witnessed a family being shot at and injured while trying to leave through an exit that the Israeli military had said civilians could take.
'We can hardly treat the patients within the hospital and are in the middle of the warzone. There are continuous air strikes, and the drones are hovering within the hospital area,' Dr Ahmad Mokhallalati said.
The facility's director, Mohammed Abu Salmiya, told Al Jazeera on Saturday that   after an electricity failure at the neonatal intensive care unit, and 37 more babies are at risk of imminent death.
Deeply worrisome and frightening: @WHO  has lost contact with its focal points in Al-Shifa Hospital in #Gaza , amid horrifying reports of the hospital facing repeated attacks.
There are reports that some of those who fled the hospital have been shot at, wounded, or killed.

On Sunday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Al-Quds Hospital was no longer operational due to a shortage of fuel and a power outage.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said early on Sunday that it had lost communication with its contacts at the hospital and confirmed receiving reports of people being killed while trying to flee.
Is anywhere safe?
For weeks, the UN and international rights groups have warned that Palestinians in Gaza, especially the most vulnerable,  .

UN shelters have not been spared either, and the organisation has said as of Friday, 66 internally displaced people have been killed and 588 have been injured while staying in UN shelters.
'Hundreds of thousands of people who remain in the north are struggling to get the essentials for their survival. Consumption of water from unsafe sources raises serious concerns about dehydration and waterborne diseases,' the UN said.
It noted that hospitals are explicitly entitled to specific protection under international humanitarian law.

Israel-Gaza: What international law says about the deadly hospital strike

The bombing of al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza has pushed countries and organisations   to label Israel's recent aggressions as a "war crime", a "massacre", and a "violation of international humanitarian law".
The   killed over 500 people in a place where civilians were taking shelter, overworked medical staff were treating patients, and the sick and injured had gathered in the hope of rescue or recovery.
Israel placed blame on the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, something viewed by many as part of a   where officials falsely attribute responsibility for attacks to other parties, often Palestinians themselves.
However, threats from Israeli officials indicate a disregard for civilians and international humanitarian law. Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari admitted that hundreds of tonnes of bombs had been dropped on Gaza with an   "on damage and not accuracy".
But what does international law say about attacks on civilians and health facilities?
I am horrified by the killing of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in a strike on a hospital in Gaza today, which I strongly condemn. My heart is with the families of the victims. Hospitals and medical personnel are protected under international humanitarian law.
- António Guterres (@antonioguterres) October 17, 2023
What law defines what counts as a war crime?
According to the United Nations, no single document in international law codifies all  . Lists of what may count as a war crime can be found in various branches of international law: humanitarian, criminal and customary law.
According to the UN, a war crime occurs during armed conflict and is a breach of the Geneva Conventions and a violation of international humanitarian law – the set of rules, also known as the "law of war", that seek to limit the effects of armed conflict.
This branch of law protects victims of war and does not recognise principles of reciprocity  – which means that parties to a conflict cannot use violations of an enemy as an excuse to not implement humanitarian norms.
On Tuesday, Israeli national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, threatened to drop explosives on Gaza if Hamas did not release captives.
Translation:
'As long as Hamas does not release the hostages in its hands – the only thing that needs to enter Gaza are hundreds of tons of explosives from the Air Force, not an ounce of humanitarian aid.'
You & your regime are the human animals & savages. https://t.co/bIJrpRlPp7
- iara (@iara_modarelli) October 17, 2023
International humanitarian law does, however, recognise "principles of proportionality", which states that an attack is in violation if the damage to civilian life is greater than any military advantage that is gained.
In Tuesday's strike, over 500 people were killed, although medics have reported that it is difficult to give an exact estimate due to the scattered limbs and that the causalities are likely much higher.
International nongovernmental organisations and state representatives are calling the bombing a "massacre" due to the destruction and loss of life it caused.
Fourth Geneva Convention
International humanitarian law, particularly in times of war, is dictated primarily by the Geneva Conventions which Israel has ratified.
Its four central conventions were formed by a series of treaties that took place between 1864 and 1949, with the first one being a shield for the sick and wounded in the armed forces.
The Fourth Geneva Convention, established in 1949, was the first to call for the overall protection of people who do not take part in any hostilities – be it   patients or healthy adult men.
A number of its articles directly address the importance of medical support: Article 14 states that hospital and safety zones must in fact be established for groups such as the injured, sick and pregnant women; Article 18 states civilian hospitals and their staff must be protected.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, Basel Sourani, an international advocacy officer for the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR), said Israeli strikes have already hit tens of Palestinian hospitals, ambulances and health workers.
"Targeting of protected places is not something new; all evidence and our conversations with witnesses point to it being an attack by Israel,' he said.
Under international humanitarian law, all warring parties have an obligation to take constant care to spare the civilian population andobjects.
Hospitals have special protections. Unlawful attacks committed deliberately or recklessly are war crimes. pic.twitter.com/KwXnbgffsy
- Human Rights Watch (@hrw) October 17, 2023
Additional Protocol One
In 1977, the first of three additional protocols was adopted under the Geneva Conventions.
Article 12 clearly states: "Medical units shall be respected and protected at all times and shall not be the object of attack."
Investigating a violation of this protocol would require the activation of an international fact-finding commission – a legal hurdle for this incident since Israel has not ratified Additional Protocol One, according to Srinivas Burra, an associate professor of international humanitarian law at South Asian University in Delhi.
Hague Conventions
While the Geneva Conventions are for the victims of war, the Hague Conventions address the conduct of warfare and allow for reciprocity toward an enemy party.
It does, however, also call for caution when it comes to medical care.
Article 27 of the regulations states: "In sieges and bombardments all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to … hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected."
It rests on the condition that such buildings must not be used for military purposes and must have visible signs indicating the presence of the building, although it does not clarify what the signs would be.
Although Israel has not ratified the Hague regulations, they are binding  on even non-ratifying states as a part of international customary law.
Rome Statue
The Rome Statue is a treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC), the body responsible for investigating and prosecuting Geneva Convention violations such as attacks on hospitals and historical monuments.
Founded in 1882, al-Ahli Arab Hospital is also one of the   hospitals in Gaza and near a church, which Sourani said also made it a place of shelter for the displaced during the ongoing offensive.
Although Israel does not recognise the ICC, Palestine does, and the attack occurring on Palestinian territory means the ICC has the jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of the incident.
Sourani said that PCHR has been trying to get the ICC to expedite an ongoing investigation into alleged Israeli war crimes and that they are disappointed with the lack of progress and response, especially compared to how the case of   was handled.
'We have been calling on the international community to hold perpetrators accountable but their silence has led us to this situation," said Sourani.
Burra told Al Jazeera a clear statement from ICC prosecutor Karim Khan on the hospital bombing would not relieve the court from launching an official incident into the event, and that it would serve more of a political rather than a legal purpose.
He said although the ICC may be playing a "wait and watch" game, the current absence of an investigation announcement was "surprising" and unlike cases that have occurred in the past.
"The silence in the current situation rightly so creates a certain amount of suspicion about the prosecutor's office," he said.

October 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The European Union has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's X social media platform over the spread of disinformation and violent content about the Israel-Hamas conflict.
The European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, on Thursday filed a binding request for information to determine if the platform complies with the rules on illegal and harmful content.
The Commission said in a statement that it launched the probe in response to "indications received concerning the presumed transmission of illicit content".
X has until Wednesday to respond to the most urgent questions in the 40-page document and until October 31 for less pressing requests for information.
The move comes after social media platforms including X have featured violent content and misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war, including footage from other conflicts and video games.
X, which has slashed its content moderation team under Musk, has come under particular scrutiny after an EU study found that it was the worst-performing platform for combatting disinformation.
Thierry Breton, the 27-nation bloc's self-proclaimed digital 'enforcer', earlier this week clashed with Musk online after accusing his platform of allowing the spread of "violent and terrorist content".
Breton has sent similar nonbinding warning letters to the heads of Meta, Instagram and TikTok.
X chief executive Linda Yaccarino has defended the social media network's record, pointing to the deletion of hundreds of Hamas-linked accounts and the removal or labelling of tens of thousands of pieces of harmful content.
Under the EU's Digital Services Act, which came into effect in August, platforms that fail to crack down on content deemed illegal can be fined up to 6 percent of their global turnover or even banned from operating within the bloc.
Fighting between Israel and Hamas entered a seventh day on Friday as the Israeli army instructed more than one million Palestinians trapped in Gaza to move south within 24 hours before an expected ground offensive.
Israeli air strikes on Gaza over the past week have killed more than 1,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 6,600 others, according to Palestinian officials.
More than 1,300 people were killed and 3,000 injured by Hamas in the deadliest attack on Israel in decades on Saturday, according to Israeli officials.

Alarm as Israel again hits Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt

Gaza's sole border crossing with Egypt, the only entry point not controlled by Israel, has been hit again by an  , reports say.
The third attack on the Rafah crossing in 24 hours consisted of "four missiles" that targeted the Palestinian side of the crossing, local Egyptian group Sinai for Human Rights said on Tuesday.
Witnesses had said the second attack hit the no-man's land between the Egyptian and Palestinian gates, damaging the hall on the Palestinian side. The Israel military said it could "neither confirm or deny" any attack on the crossing "at this point", the AFP news agency reported.
NGO Sinai for Human Rights said Tuesday's attacks prompted the closure of the crossing, but there was no immediate confirmation from either side.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Israeli military revised a recommendation by one of its spokespeople that Palestinians fleeing its air raids in Gaza head to Egypt.
Rafah is the sole possible crossing point into Sinai for Gaza's 2.3 million residents. The rest of the 40km-long (25-mile-long) strip of land is surrounded by Israel and the sea. The passage of people and goods is strictly controlled under a blockade of Gaza enforced by Egypt and Israel.
Meanwhile, Israel's assault on Gaza has reportedly caused alarm in Egypt, which has urged Israel to provide   from the besieged enclave rather than encouraging them to flee southwest towards Sinai, two Egyptian security sources told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday.
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Tuesday said the   was "highly dangerous" and that Egypt was pushing with regional and international partners for a negotiated solution to the violence.
Egypt would not allow the issue to be settled at the expense of others, el-Sisi said in comments reported by state news agency MENA, an apparent reference to the risk that Palestinians could be pushed into Sinai.
Egypt, the first Arab country to normalise relations with Israel, has mediated between Israel and Palestinian factions during previous conflicts in Gaza and has pressed to prevent further escalation in the current fighting.
Israel has been   with the fiercest attacks in the 75-year history of its conflict with the Palestinians, after Hamas launched a deadly and unprecedented incursion into Israel on Saturday.
On Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a  , cutting access to water, food, fuel and electricity. Such a siege of Gaza by the Israeli army, with the intent to starve a population, is a war crime under United Nations statutes.
'What it seems to me is that the measures taken, including the bombing of the Rafah crossing, hints to an intention to really starve and kill the people who are innocent inside the Gaza Strip,' UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese told Al Jazeera, adding that Palestinians in Gaza are concerned that they could experience something akin to a   in the days ahead.
Gaza's health ministry on Tuesday said at least 830 people, including women and children, have been killed and more than 4,250 wounded since Saturday. At least 900 Israelis have also been killed since the unprecedented attack by Hamas.
The siege of Gaza has also raised fears that Palestinian civilians could find themselves facing an enormous onslaught, or even an Israeli ground invasion, with nowhere to flee.
Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said Israeli bombardments on Monday and Tuesday hit an entry gate on the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing. The crossing was also closed from the Egyptian side and Palestinians planning to travel to Gaza retreated to north Sinai's main city of Al Arish, Egyptian sources said.
The latest attack on Rafah follows a similar incident on Monday that partially disrupted operations at the border, though Egyptian security sources said access for registered travellers and humanitarian activity had been restored by Tuesday morning.
On Monday, about 800 people left Gaza through the Rafah crossing and about 500 people entered, though the crossing was closed for the movement of goods, according to the United Nations humanitarian office.

Israel halts exports from Gaza at key crossing, says explosives found

Israeli forces have ordered the suspension of all commercial goods   after an alleged attempt to smuggle explosives, the army and defence ministry said in a statement.
Israel's military, which controls the crossing points between Israel and the Palestinian enclave, "detected several kilograms of high quality explosives, hidden within a clothing delivery carried by three trucks" at the Kerem Shalom crossing, the army and ministry said in a statement on Monday.
  "commercial deliveries from Gaza to Israel' is being carried out to allow 'security adjustments to be made at the crossing", according to the statement.
"Deliveries will resume in accordance with subsequent situation assessments," it added.
Palestinian border officials said they were told by Israel that the crossing would be closed "until further notice".
The Kerem Shalom crossing is the only point of export of goods from Gaza, which has been under a crippling Israeli blockade since Hamas seized power there in 2007. The blockade has exacted a huge economic toll and most Palestinians in Gaza depend on foreign aid.
The closure of the crossing point for goods comes amid raging tensions in the occupied West Bank and spiralling violence that has seen at least 225 Palestinians killed so far this year. At least 32 Israelis, a Ukrainian and an Italian have also been killed during the same period.

1) Gaza: Surviving Shujayea
On the 13th day of Israel's assault on Gaza in July 2014, it declared the neighbourhood of Shujayea a closed military zone. That neighbourhood was home to eight-year-old Bisan Daher and her family. Israeli attacks on the area forced thousands of residents to flee and killed at least 72.
As Israeli planes flew overhead, a Palestinian ambulance team heard someone crying for help from deep beneath the remains of a home. It was Bisan. Six members of her family had been killed in the bombing.
This film tells the story of her survival against the odds and of the close bond that formed between the young girl and her rescuers.
2) Farah: Scarred by Gaza's War
When Israeli forces attacked her home in Gaza, killing her mother, grandfather, aunt and three uncles, three-year-old Farah was left with third-degree burns.
This film follows her journey as she travels to the US for treatment, undergoing medical care surrounded by unfamiliar faces, and tells the story of the Arab American families who take her in during her nine-month ordeal.
3) Skies Above Hebron: Growing up Palestinian in the occupied West Bank
Three Palestinian boys grow up in the divided heart of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron.
Over five years, this film follows the challenges and hopes of the boys, Amer, Anas and Marwaan, as they face threats to arrest them and Israeli settlers eager to move into their homes.
4) Defying My Disability
In this film, we meet seven Palestinians aged between seven and 28 with different disabilities. Mostwere born with them;one was injuredin Israeli attacks on Gaza.
In the face of conflict, occupation, tragedy and disability - in places ill-equipped to handle special needs - we see how they have learned to navigate complex challenges with optimism and strength.
5) Between Fire & Sea: The Man Behind Gaza's Great March of Return
'What would happen if thousands of Gazans, most of them refugees, attempted to peacefully cross the fence that separated them from their ancestral lands?' was a question posed by Ahmed Abu Artema, a Palestinian poet and non-violence resistance activist, on Facebook.
His post went viral and became the rallying cry that inspired a movement of peaceful protests known as the Great March of Return. Many of the marches took on a carnival-like atmosphere, with people of all ages and even traditional dabke dancers in attendance. But they were met with violence.
This film follows Ahmed as he visits some of the injured and relatives of those killed and tries to reconcile the human toll with his belief in the power of non-violence.

Jordan and Israel have announced the airdrop of urgent medical supplies to a field hospital in the Gaza Strip.
Jordan's King Abdullah II said early on Monday that the Jordanian air force had dropped "urgent medical aid" to the field hospital operated by the kingdom in the enclave since 2009.
'Our fearless air force personnel air-dropped at midnight urgent medical aid to the Jordanian field hospital in Gaza,' he said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
'This is our duty to aid our brothers and sisters injured in the war on Gaza. 'We will always be there for our Palestinian brethren.'

Israel's military said in a statement later on Monday that it had "coordinated" with its Arab neighbour on the drop, which it said also included food.
"The equipment will be used by the medical staff for patients," it said.
Last month, Saudi Arabia's Arab News, citing an unnamed official, reported that the Jordanian field hospital was facing an 'existential threat' and would likely stop operating soon due to a lack of supplies amid Israeli bombing.
Humanitarian organisations have warned of a growing humanitarian crisis due to shortages of food, water, electricity and fuel caused by Israel's blockade and bombing of the enclave.
On Sunday, the heads of 12 United Nations agencies issued a rare   condemning the siege on Gaza as 'unacceptable' and calling for aid to be delivered 'safely, swiftly and at the scale needed'.
The airdrop came as United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Turkey as part of a high-stakes diplomatic tour of the region, following visits to Israel, the occupied West Bank, Jordan and Iraq.
Jordan, like other Arab countries, has strongly condemned Israel's bombardment of Gaza, which officials in the Hamas-governed enclave say has killed at least 9,922 Palestinians.
Amman last week recalled its ambassador to Israel after accusing the country of creating an 'unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe' in the enclave.

Israel-Gaza war fuels online anti-Semitism, Islamophobia in China

Following Hamas's surprise assault on Israel and the subsequent Israeli  , Jen Tao logged on to the Chinese social media platform Weibo to express her condolences for the thousands who had died on both sides of the conflict.
'I thought I was going to find kind words for the victims, but instead I was shocked to see a lot of hateful things posted about Muslims and Jews,' the 38-year-old surgeon at a hospital in Shanghai, told Al Jazeera.
Tao was particularly appalled when a video of a Chinese Israeli woman being taken away on a motorcycle by Hamas appeared on Chinese social media.
In the comment section, one netizen wrote: 'I do not want to pay attention to her!'
Another accused the woman of being a 'Nazi monster' for having served in the Israeli military (most Israeli citizens have to complete military service).
'She is Chinese, but even she got such comments,' Tao said.
The broader discussion of the   has similarly been marked by hate speech.
One online comment read: 'Palestine has no civilians. It only has little terrorists, old terrorists, female and male terrorists, who should all be wiped out.'
Another called for the killing of Arabs to end terrorism while a third stated that Muslims were terrorists who needed to be bombed for peace to be achieved.
Anti-Semitic comments have been more predominant, however.
'It is really the fault of Little Moustache [Hitler],' a netizen wrote. 'If he had burned all of them [Jews], we wouldn't have this much trouble.'
'In European wars, you will see the shadow of Jews making money, like vultures,' wrote another.
When asked to comment on the anti-Semitic comments on Chinese social media, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said this week that 'China's laws unequivocally prohibit disseminating information on extremism, ethnic hatred, discrimination and violence via the internet.'
But Tao does not see such laws being enforced.

And by allowing hatred to flourish, she believes the Chinese leadership is undermining its own   in the month-long Israel-Gaza war.
The Chinese leadership has called for an immediate ceasefire, and in the long term, called for the realisation of peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel.
'When you tolerate hate at home, how can you call for peace internationally?'
A distant conflict
Hongda Fan is a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University.
'There are different opinions on the current Israel-Gaza conflict in the Chinese public sphere,' he said in an email to Al Jazeera.
But at the same time, the vast majority of Chinese people do not know the background of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, according to Fan.
'They are not very aware of the political divisions within Palestine and the differences in governance between Gaza and the West Bank.'
Hsia Liang Hou, 42, a cybersecurity specialist from Chengdu in central China, likewise believes that there are many   that are not broadly understood in China.
'Chinese people generally don't know a lot about the conflict and its long history because it doesn't affect China a lot,' he said.
Hsia believes that the general lack of insight regarding the conflict and its history explains some of the racist comments that have circulated on the Chinese internet.
'It is not because all Chinese people are racist towards Arabs and Jews,' he said.
Although Tao was appalled by some of the content on social media, she also cautions against using online comments to make conclusions about the general sentiment of Chinese people regarding anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.
'A lot of people don't express their opinions on social media, and also the government blocks and censors all sorts of things on the [Chinese] internet all the time,' she said.
'You don't get to see everything; you get to see what's acceptable to the government.'
Israel-Palestine uncensored
Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia have not been limited to China's internet, but unlike much of the rest of the world, online content is   within China. For nine years in a row, China has been ranked as having the world's worst environment for internet freedom.
A recent example of the state's online interference came with the sudden death of  . After Li died on October 27, the authorities released instructions on the management of media content related to the former premier.
Subsequently, online discussions of Li were censored and quotes associated with him were removed from online forums.
Deaths of Chinese political leaders have led to political upheaval in the past and are, therefore, considered sensitive by the authorities.
'The authorities censor stuff online that they see as a threat to their power,' said Hsia, the cybersecurity specialist.
The anti-Semitic and Islamophobic content is not a threat to the Chinese government, and in some ways particularly the anti-Semitic content, is making the same arguments that the Chinese state is making - only in more racist terms, according to William Figueroa, an assistant professor at the University of Groningen, who has conducted research on China's relationship with Middle Eastern countries.
While the top of the Chinese government has called for peace and coexistence, Chinese media and influential figures have been much more conspiratorial and antagonistic in their rhetoric towards Israel and Jewish people in general.
A post on the social media account of the government-controlled CCTV claimed falsely that three percent of Jews in the US control 70 percent of American wealth. The topic was one of the top-trending on the short messaging service, Weibo.
China has its own messaging platforms, which are usually heavily censored [File: Florence Lo/Reuters]
Meanwhile, Shen Yi, a prominent professor of international relations at Fudan University, compared Israel's attacks on Gaza to acts of aggression perpetrated by the Nazis, while Hu Xijin, a leading commentator and former editor-in-chief of the state-run Global Times, expressed concern about Israel wiping 'the Earth out of the solar system'.
According to Lin Pu, who is a scholar of digital authoritarianism and Chinese influence at Tulane University in the US, the Chinese authorities refrain from censoring certain anti-Semitic comments because they do not disrupt the Chinese government's messaging of showing sympathy and support for Palestine.
'Anti-Israel sentiment highlights one aspect of the Chinese stance toward this issue that the Chinese government does not want to express explicitly for diplomatic reasons,' he said.
More broadly, censuring offensive and racist speech is generally not a priority for the Chinese state, according to Figueroa.
'You can find all kinds of racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Islamic sentiment on Chinese social media any given day of the week,' he said.
The only way that Figueroa sees that the Chinese government might be concerned with such content is if Western nations use it to portray China negatively.
'But this hasn't been a significant issue so far.'
Tao believes that Beijing should stay true to its call for peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
'That starts with shutting down the racism and the hate in the media and online here in China,' she said.
'If the government must use its censorship powers, it should use it on this.'

UK revokes Egyptian TV host's visa for 'backing Hamas' at rally: Report

November 11th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
An exiled Egyptian television presenter has reportedly had his visa revoked by the United Kingdom for allegedly supporting Hamas amid government efforts to crack down on support for the Palestinian armed organisation it considers a 'terrorist' group.
The Home Office cancelledMoataz Matar's visa for, among other things, taking part in pro-Palestinian protests in London and supporting Hamas, according to the London-based Telegraph news website.
The 49-year-old has also been put on a watch list, which means he will be unable to return to the UK.
This is reportedly the first 'expulsion' by Home Secretary Suella Braverman and Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick since the October 7 Hamas attack inside Israel that killed some 1,200 people.
Since then, Israel has been launching air raids and a ground assault on Gaza, where the group is based, which has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, creating a humanitarian crisis. Israel has refused an immediate ceasefire despite growing international calls.
British officials have announced plans for a crackdown on alleged 'anti-Semitic' behaviour in the wake of the Hamas attack, and the Telegraph reported at least another half dozen foreign nationals could have their visas revoked.
'There can be zero tolerance for visitors to the UK who abuse the privilege of a visa and endorse evil terrorist acts,' Jenrick was quoted as saying. 'To any individuals considering following suit in the coming days and weeks, be in no doubt that we will continue to revoke visas wherever required. We will not tolerate extremism on our streets.'
Matar has reportedly left the UK, but he will be barred from returning by border officials due to the watch list.
The Home Office has powers to revoke foreign nationals' student, visitor, or work visas where it deems a person's behaviour to be 'not conducive to the public good' or if they are judged a threat to national security.
Jenrick and Chris Philip, the policing minister, have reportedly asked all 43 police forces in England and Wales to report any foreign individuals caught in any potentially "extremist activities" that could be grounds for the revocation of their visas.
Following the Hamas attack, Jenrick has also reportedly stayed in contact with the Community Security Trust, tasked with providing security to Jewish communities, to pass on names of any foreign nationals they deem to exhibit 'anti-Semitic' behaviour.
France has also imposed a ban on pro-Palestinian rallies and cracked down on people demonstrating against the killing of civilians in Gaza.
France's interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, has ordered that all foreign nationals who are found to commit anti-Semitic acts be expelled immediately from the country. At least three have already been expelled by France.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that Israel should  . Israel quickly rejected his remarks, saying world leaders should be condemning Hamas, not Israelis.

Indonesians boycott McDonald's, Starbucks over support for Israel

Medan, Indonesia – Ade Andrian, operational manager of the Medan branch of the humanitarian organisation Medical Emergency Rescue Committee (MER-C), used to visit McDonald's at least once a month with his family.
'My favourite order was the family meal,' Andrian told Al Jazeera. 'Or if I went to the drive-through, I would always order ice cream.'
But since last month, Andrian has heeded calls across Indonesia to boycott the Golden Arches, along with all Israeli products and goods from Israel's allies.
'I have not been to McDonald's since we found out that McDonald's Israel had been providing assistance and discounts to the Israeli military,' he said. 'What is happening here?'
Indonesians began boycotting McDonald's and other businesses in mid-October after McDonald's Israel announced on social media that it had handed out thousands of free meals to the Israeli military amid its war with Hamas.
The announcement prompted several Indonesian organisations, including Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS), the United People Front (FUB) and the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), to call for a boycott of McDonald's and other businesses perceived to be pro-Israel, including Starbucks and Burger King.
The boycott comes despite McDonald's Indonesia, which is owned by PT Rekso Nasional Food, last week announcing that it had 'deployed humanitarian assistance valued at IDR [Indonesian rupiahs] 1,5 billion [$96,000]' to support Palestinians.
While McDonald's is synonymous with the United States, most of its restaurants worldwide are locally owned, and franchisees in numerous Muslim countries have expressed support for Palestinians and pledged money to support relief efforts in Gaza.
Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has long been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and does not have an Israeli embassy.

On Sunday, tens of thousands of Indonesians, including Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi and the former Jakarta governor and presidential hopeful Anies Baswedan, gathered at the National Monument in Jakarta to express solidarity with Palestinians and call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
Due to security fears, several McDonald's and Starbucks branches near the monument were closed on the day of the demonstration.
Last week, the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), Indonesia's top Muslim clerical body, issued a fatwa making it haram to "support Israeli aggression against Palestine or parties supporting Israel, either directly or indirectly".
While the extent of public support for the boycotts is unclear, a branch of McDonald's in Medan that usually does a roaring trade appeared much quieter than usual when visited by Al Jazeera on Tuesday and Thursday.
Staff there told Al Jazeera they had not been experiencing the usual lunchtime and evening rushes and they suspected the boycott calls were to blame.
It is not only McDonald's that appears to be experiencing a drop off in business.

A Starbucks located at Focal Point Mall in Medan, where staff are usually rushed off their feet, has been almost deserted in recent weeks, an employee told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.
'We have noticed that it has been much quieter than usual, although we can't say for sure why that is,' the employee said. 'It could be because of a range of factors like the fact that we don't have any promotions on at the moment. We don't know, but no customers have asked us about the boycott yet.'
Starbucks, which operates a similar franchise model as McDonald's, last month criticised its union for posting 'Solidarity with Palestine' on social media above an image of a Hamas bulldozer knocking down a fence during the group's October 7 attacks on Israel. Starbucks Indonesia did not respond to requests for comment.
In a statement to Al Jazeera, McDonald's Corporation, which is based in the US state of Illinois, said that it was 'dismayed by the disinformation and inaccurate reports regarding our position in response to the conflict in the Middle East".
McDonald's said it does not fund or support any governments involved in the conflict and any actions by local business partners were made independently without the fast food giant's consent or approval.
'Our hearts are with all of the communities and families impacted by this crisis,' the company said.
'We abhor violence of any kind and firmly stand against hate speech, and we will always proudly open our doors to everyone. We are doing everything we can to ensure the safety of our people in the region while supporting the communities where we operate.'
McDonald's Indonesia says it is 'unwavering in its commitment to uphold the values of humanity and wants to take an active role in relief efforts in Gaza" [Aisyah Llewellyn/Al Jazeera]
McDonald's Indonesia told Al Jazeera in a statement that it was 'unwavering in its commitment to uphold the values of humanity and wants to take an active role in relief efforts in Gaza".
'We at McDonald's Indonesia hope for a swift achievement of peace so that there will be no more casualties, especially among children and women, as a result of this conflict,' the company said.
For Indonesians like Andrian, though, spending money on brands associated with Israel remains out of the question.
'We need to ask ourselves who businesses are supporting,' he said. 'I support the freedom of Palestine and humanitarian assistance to Palestine.'

Diplomatic dash as end of Israel-Gaza truce looms

Intense negotiations were under way as the truce in the Israel-Gaza war entered its final day.
Statements from Israel, Hamas, the United States and others, released overnight and into the morning, stressed the urgency of extending the four-day pause in the war, which is due to end on Monday.
The diplomatic drive is continuing as the two sides prepare a fourth prisoner swap. Israel has said it is prepared to pause its onslaught on the enclave by one day in exchange for the release of 10 additional hostages, although it has also reiterated its intention to continue fighting until "victory".
US President Joe Biden said on Sunday that he hoped the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas could continue as long as hostages were being released. The Palestinian group freed 17 more people yesterday, including a four-year-old Israeli-American girl.
Extending the truce  'is my goal, that's our goal, to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into those in need in Gaza," Biden told a press conference.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was expected to visit Israel on Monday, before heading to Brussels to attend a NATO foreign ministers' meeting, where the crisis in Gaza is expected to be discussed on the sidelines.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he spoke to Biden about the hostage release. However, he said he also told the US leader that, at the end of the truce, Israel will return with full force to achieve its goals for the elimination of Hamas and the release of all hostages.
Netanyahu became the first Israeli leader since 2005 to appear in Gaza on Sunday. Standing on a tank in fatigues, he reiterated the war aims to soldiers, but also mentioned the possibility of extending the truce.
Hamas said it wanted to extend the pause in fighting if serious efforts were made to increase the number of Palestinian detainees released by Israel.
A spokesperson said that the group that governs Gaza would like the fighting to be paused for "as long as prisoners keep coming out".
Four rounds of exchanges
Thirty-nine teenage Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel on Sunday, taking the total since the truce began to 117.
Hamas said it had handed over 13 Israelis, three Thais and one with Russian citizenship in the fourth phase of the truce deal exchanges between the two sides. The Palestinian group has released a total of 58 hostages, including 39 to Israel.
The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed it had successfully transferred the latest group from Gaza on Sunday.
Biden said that he believed 'all the players in the region are looking for a way to end this so the hostages are all released and … Hamas is completely no longer in control of Gaza".
He also expressed his happiness over the release of the four-year-old American-Israeli hostage, Abigail Edan.
The four-day truce agreed last week is the first halt in   since Hamas's October 7 attack, which, Israel says, killed 1,200 people and took about 240 hostages back into Gaza.
In response to that attack, Israel has bombarded the enclave and mounted a ground offensive in the enclave. Some 14,800 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza health authorities say, and hundreds of thousands displaced.
'Extension is unlikely'
Despite the diplomatic efforts, there is some doubt in the region that an extension to the truce is possible.
It's unlikely to happen, given the messages coming from the Israeli side, Professor Ibrahim Abusharif from Northwestern University in Qatar said.
'I also think a ceasefire is not the same as putting out the fire to the original spark - the original point of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians,' he told Al Jazeera.
'If they are just extending the truce for a few days, and resuming the carnage, it doesn't seem like an effective way to move forward. It's not moving forward at all.'
Israeli Army Radio said on Monday that the government in Tel Aviv was awaiting Hamas's response on extending the truce for an additional day in exchange for the release of 10 detainees.
Blinken spoke with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry on Sunday to discuss obstacles threatening Israel's truce with Hamas and ways to reach a comprehensive ceasefire, Egypt's foreign ministry said.
Meanwhile, China's top diplomat Wang Yi will visit New York this week to hold a United Nations Security Council meeting on the Israel-Hamas conflict, Beijing's foreign ministry said.

Q&A: Bali bomber on crime, punishment, and what motivated deadly attack

East Java, Indonesia -   after serving just over half of a 20-year jail sentence for the Bali holiday island bombings in 2002, which killed 202 people. He was also convicted for a series of bomb attacks on Christian churches on Christmas Eve, 2000, that left 18 dead.
On the run for almost a decade, 57-year-old Patek from Central Java was   and extradited to Indonesia where he was found guilty of  . The US State Department had offered a reward of $1m for any information leading to his capture.
Patek's early prison release for good behaviour in 2022 was sharply criticised by Australian officials and the relatives of the hundreds of victims of the Bali bombing.
Al Jazeera recently interviewed Patek at his home in East Java where he spoke about his role in Bali and revealed that the horrific bomb attack two decades ago was an act of revenge for the violence inflicted on Palestinian people by Israeli forces.
  and of being unsure whether God would forgive him for killing so many civilians.
Umar Patek at his home in East Java, Indonesia, on October 14, 2023 [Al Jazeera]
Al Jazeera: How did you become involved with Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), the armed group behind the Bali Bombings?
Umar Patek: In 1991, I was working in Malaysia and   [a senior JI figure who was sentenced to death and executed in 2008 for masterminding the Bali bombings] in Johor Bahru at the Lukman Hakim Islamic Boarding School.
I worked on a plantation in Malaysia, and would go to religious classes in the evening at the school. Then Mukhlas asked me to work at the school, so I moved in. After three months at the school, he offered me the chance to go to Pakistan. I wanted to study and he said I could study religion there.
I first went to Peshawar and then to Sadda, a tribal area in Pakistan which is close to the border with Afghanistan, where there was a military academy that trained people to be mujahideen [Islamic fighters]. From there I moved to a military academy in Torkham in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, I was in the same class as [Bali bomber] Ali Imron. In total, I was away for five years from 1991 to 1995.
We learned everything at the military academy to train us to be mujahideen, such as how to use weapons, map reading and bomb making. We practised blowing up bombs in areas where there were no people, like in caves or on hillsides, so that there would not be any fatalities.
We also wanted to make sure that no goats were accidentally killed because lots of people tend goats in Afghanistan.
 
When I finished my military training in 1995, I went to the Philippines to join the   because I supported their cause as a Muslim.
From 1995 to 2000, I lived at Camp Abubakar in the Bangsamoro region in the Philippines, but the camp was captured by the Philippine Army in July 2000 and I was told to leave because I looked like I came from the Middle East.
My family is originally from Yemen, although I am the fourth generation of my family to be born in Indonesia. My face didn't look like the people in Moro.
In December 2000, I went back to Indonesia and stayed with   [a JI member and one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia who was nicknamed 'the Genius' because of his expertise in electronics for bombs]. Dulmatin asked me to go to Jakarta for work. He had a job selling cars and he said I could also look for work there, which is how I became involved in the Christmas Eve church bombings.

AJ: You admitted to mixing the chemicals for the bombs used in the Bali bombing in 2002 and the Christmas Eve church bombings in 2000. But you also said you didn't know what the bombs would be used for. Where did you think the bombs would be planted?
Patek: I did not mix the bombs for the church bombings, I only knew about the bombs at the time of delivery. It was Eid al-Fitr [the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan] and Dulmatin said, 'Let's go home to Pemalang for the holiday and drop off some things along the way.'
We kept stopping at churches, although I did not get out of the car. Every time we stopped at a church, I grew more suspicious that we were dropping off bombs because the packages were packed in laptop bags.
I was sentenced for the bombings even though I did not make the bombs or get out of the car because I was there and I didn't do anything to stop it. Dulmatin then asked me to go on a trip to Bali in October 2002. We went into a house which was already full of bomb making equipment.

I met with [JI members]  , Mukhlas, Idris and Dr Azahari. Imam Samudra said that they wanted revenge for   [by Israeli forces in 2002 which killed more than 50 Palestinians as well as 23 Israeli soldiers], so they wanted to bomb Westerners in nightclubs in Bali. He ushered me into one of the rooms in the house where all the ingredients to make the bombs had been prepared.
I told them, if we wanted to get revenge for the atrocities committed against Muslims in Palestine, we should go to Palestine and not kill Westerners in Indonesia. I asked them, 'What is the relationship between these people who will be victims and your motive of revenge for Muslims in Palestine?'
I told them that if they wanted to kill Westerners in large numbers using a one-tonne bomb, it would not just kill the people in front of it. It would explode everywhere. I told them that it would kill lots of other people who were not their target.

I said that a bomb would also likely cause Muslim casualties. I asked them, 'Who will take responsibility in the next world [paradise] if there are Muslim victims because of this bomb?'
Imam Samudra said that, on the day of judgement, everyone would be judged individually for their actions based on their intentions.
I felt that there was no way I could refuse. Imam Samudra had locked the front door of the house so that no one could leave.
So I did it, and made the last 50kg [110lbs] of the bomb.
AJ: More than 200 people died in Bali as a result of the bomb you helped to make. How do you feel about killing so many people?
Patek: I felt guilty when I mixed the materials for the bomb and I felt I was sinning. I felt I was breaking Indonesian law but, more than that, I felt it was a sin against God.

AJ: Do you consider yourself to be a mass murderer?
Patek: Yes. I feel that I am a murderer and a sinner.
  several times and met with the families of the victims of the bombing, too. I told them I was sorry. Everyone who has met with me in person has forgiven me. When I meet victims, I say, 'I am Umar Patek and I was involved in the Bali bombing,' then I explain why I was there, and apologise.
Some people don't want to meet me and don't want to forgive me, like people from Australia. That is their right, but my responsibility as a Muslim, and someone who has done wrong, is to apologise. I don't know if I will be forgiven, only God knows that.
I did not say sorry to get out of prison early, but everything is always wrong in other people's eyes. If I say sorry, people say I am pretending and it is a strategic choice.If I didn't apologise, people would say I was arrogant.
AJ: Did you agree with the 20-year prison sentence that you were given?
Patek: I accepted it at the time. There is nothing fair in this life on Earth, justice will only come in the hereafter.

AJ: Your release from prison was highly controversial, particularly in Australia, as you only served 11 years of your 20-year sentence. Should you have been freed?
Patek: I fulfilled all the criteria according to Indonesian law to qualify for release in 2022. I had also been very opposed to the idea of the Bali bombing from the beginning. The witnesses at my trial all said the same, which is why I was sentenced to 20 years in prison [only]. The central people in the Bali bombing were sentenced to death or died in other ways like Dulmatin, who was shot by the police.

I last saw him in June 2009, when I came home from the Philippines to Jakarta. He asked me to go to a JI military academy in Aceh, but I said I didn't want to. I had had enough. I told him I was just transiting in Indonesia to get my passport and visa to go to Afghanistan. I wanted to live there for the rest of my life and I asked him to come with me, but he refused.
He [Dulmatin] was shot in Pemulang in Tangerang [a city on the outskirts of Jakarta]. I wondered if he had repented for his sins before he died. I never heard him say he felt remorse or sadness about the victims of the Bali bombing and about people who were not the target of the bombing. He never said anything about that and never asked for forgiveness.
So I was sad for him.

AJ: Is the killing of civilians ever justified?
Patek: When I was in the Philippines with the [Moro front], I lived with [the chairman] Salamat Hashim and he would often preach to us. He strongly forbade mujahideen from attacking civilians, not just Muslims but also Christians. He said that that was not allowed, and that only members of the army, or civilians who were fighting with the army, and who were also carrying weapons, were allowed to be attacked.
He once said to me, 'Why do you want to wage jihad in Indonesia, who do you want to fight there? The president is Muslim, the government is Muslim, the People's Representative Council is mainly Muslim, lots of police are Muslim, the army is full of Muslims. It is haram [forbidden] to attack them because attacking Muslims is not allowed.'
He felt that it was not right to attack people in Indonesia, and I said that at the time of the Bali bombing, but no one wanted to listen to me.
AJ: What are your thoughts on the Israel-Gaza war?
Patek: In the opening section of the 1945 Indonesian Constitution, it says that 'all colonialism must be abolished in this world'.
Occupation anywhere, not just in Palestine, is not allowed.
It is Hamas's right to take back their land. The news that they are killing babies and children is a hoax perpetrated by the Western media. Indonesia used to be occupied by the Dutch colonialists. Would you call Indonesian heroes, who fought for their independence, terrorists? The Dutch would call them terrorists, but they were just taking back their land.

AJ: Are you deradicalised now?
Patek: What is radicalised? If a Christian wants to follow their religion according to the teachings of the Bible, would we call them radicalised?
I feel that the media has a false image of me as someone who is frightening and cruel. They always paint me as someone who is dangerous.
People often ask me why I don't want to be a terrorist any more and why I am so cooperative. I also say that it is from my family. They are the ones who melted my heart and set me back to the right path.
I am the oldest of three brothers. All my family members are moderate Muslims, none of them have ever followed the same ideology I used to follow, and they have often confronted me about it over the years.
If my family had said they did not want to have anything more to do with me because of my old ideology, perhaps I would still be radical in my thinking, but fortunately they embraced me and that allowed me to change.
AJ: How do you feel about non-Muslims?
Patek: When I was a child growing up, all my neighbours were Chinese Christians. I always used to play with them. Since I was young, I have always been around non-Muslims.
I don't hate Christians.My wife's extended family are Christians and, when we got married, we had no problems and took photos together on our wedding day.
When I married my wife, I invited all of her family to the wedding at Camp Abubakar. In the beginning, they didn't want to come because they were worried we would cut their heads off. I told them that the mujahideen did not harm civilians, and that we only attacked the police and the army. I said that I guaranteed their safety.
In the Moro tradition, when someone got married, mujahideen would shoot their weapons in the air to celebrate. But because my wife's Christian family was there, I told my fellow mujahideen, 'Don't do the traditional celebration because we have Christians coming and it will scare them.
'They will think we are trying to kill them.'

Pro-Palestine crowd storms Russia's Dagestan to protest flight from Israel

October 29th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Hundreds of people stormed the main airport in Russia's Dagestan region on Sunday evening to protest the arrival of a flight from Israel.
Authorities on Sunday closed the airport in Makhachkala, the capital of the predominantly Muslim region, and police converged on the facility. There were no immediate reports of arrests but there were several injuries.
"As a result of the incident at Makhachkala airport, there are injured (people), who are receiving medical help," Dagestan's health ministry said on Telegram, without elaborating.
Local news reports said the airliner belonged to Russian carrier Red Wings.
Social media footage showed some in the crowd on the landing field waving Palestinian flags and others checking the passports of passengers who had arrived in Makhachkala.
'We're getting reports that now, protesters are trying to overturn a police car at Makhachkala airport,' said Al Jazeera's Yulia Shapovalova, reporting from Moscow. 'Police reportedly fired into the air to try and disperse the crowd.'
One protester could be seen in the videos holding a sign reading, "Child killers have no place in Dagestan."
In a statement released on Sunday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel "expects the Russian law enforcement authorities to protect the safety of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they may be and to act resolutely against the rioters and against the wild incitement directed against Jews and Israelis."
Appeals for calm
The Ministry of Internal Affairs for Russia's North Caucasian Federal District, where Dagestan is located, said that CCTV footage would be used to establish the identities of those who stormed the airport and those involved would be brought to justice.
While voicing support for Gaza, the regional Dagestan government appealed to citizens to remain calm and not take part in such protests.
The government warned the protesters on Telegram "not to continue illegal acts and not to interfere with the work of airport employees".
The statement added: "It is not easy for each of us to stand and watch the inhumane massacre of a civilian population – the Palestinian people. At the same time, we urge residents of the republic not to succumb to provocations of destructive groups and not to create panic in society."
The incident comes as Israel pushes forward with expanded ground operations inside the Gaza Strip, even as heavy aerial bombardment continues. More than 8,000 Palestinians, including 3,324 children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the war began. At least 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel, mostly in a surprise attack by Hamas on October 7.
The Supreme Mufti of Dagestan, Sheikh Akhmad Afandi, called on residents to stop the unrest at the airport.
"You are mistaken. This issue cannot be resolved in this way. We understand and perceive your indignation very painfully… We will solve this issue differently. Not with rallies, but appropriately. Maximum patience and calm for you," he said in a video published on Telegram.
Russia's civilian aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, later reported that the airfield had been cleared of unauthorised people but that the airport would tentatively remain closed to incoming aircraft until November 6.
Chechnya and Dagestan are two volatile republics in Russia, both of which have mainly Muslim populations.
Earlier on Sunday, the RIA Novosti news agency reported that a Jewish centre in the city of Nalchik in another Russian republic – Kabardino-Balkaria – had been set on fire.

During the deadly October 7 assault by Hamas on southern Israel, it killed more than 1,400 people and took hundreds  .
Hamas said it plans to use the captives to negotiate the release of thousands of Palestinians in Israeli prisons.
However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out such negotiations and instead has focused on bombarding the Gaza Strip from the air and sea and has increasingly conducted land operations.
More than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, including more than 3,700 children.
Here's what we know about the captives:
How many captives are there?
The military wing of Hamas, the  , said through its spokesperson Abu Obeida that the original number of captives held was 200 to 250 with Hamas holding about 200.
The spokesperson also said 50 captives have been killed in the Israeli air raids on the Gaza Strip.
According to the Israeli army, the number of captives is 240, and they include Israeli soldiers, civilians and foreigners.
Israeli authorities have not publicly named the captives so far, but the Israeli newspaper Haaretz  reported that, according to army spokesperson Daniel Hagari, a "substantial" number are military officers.
How many foreigners are among the captives?
According to Hamas leader Mousa Abu Marzouk, the group considers captives who are citizens of both Israel and another country to be Israeli and will not release them until Israel agrees to a ceasefire.
"Hamas does not consider its captives to be Russian, French or American," the Russia state news agency RIA quoted him as saying on Tuesday.
"All those captured for us are Israelis although there is an appeal to look at their original nationalities in the hope that this will save them," he said.
Abu Marzouk said Russia, the United States, France, Spain, Italy and many other countries have called for the release of their citizens.
Thailand is in talks with Iran, an ally of Hamas, and other governments to secure the release of 23 of its citizens held in Gaza, according to its foreign minister.
Germany said at least eight Germans are being held captive.Argentina and the Netherlands also said they have citizens held in Gaza.
Who else is holding captives?
An unspecified number of Israeli captives are being held by civilian residents in the Gaza Strip, Hamas said.
"After the Israeli army's defence lines were broken and the army's Gaza Division fell [on October 7], hundreds of citizens and dozens of fighters from various Palestinian factions entered the territories occupied in 1948 and captured dozens, most of them civilians," Abu Marzouk said.
He went on to say that Hamas needs time to search for captives taken by residents to "classify them and then release the civilians among them who do not hold Israeli nationalities".
How many captives have been released?
Four captives have been released so far after negotiations through diplomatic channels with mediation from countries that include Qatar and Egypt.
On October 20, Hamas released the first captives – US citizens Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, 17 – saying it was for 'humanitarian reasons'.
On October 23, two Israeli women – Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85 – were also released.
According to the Israeli military, a fifth person, a soldier, Private Ori Megidish, was rescued on October 30 during a ground raid inside Gaza. Abu Obeida said she was not held  by the Qassam Brigades and it was possible she was held by civilians or individual parties in Gaza.
What has Hamas said?
The Hamas leadership has repeatedly said it is prepared to carry out a prisoner swap.
'We are ready to conduct an immediate prisoner exchange deal that includes the release of all Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in exchange for all prisoners held by the Palestinian resistance,' Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's leader in the Gaza Strip, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Israel has   in its jails since October 7 from 5,200 to more than 10,000. This includes 4,000 labourers from Gaza who were working in Israel before they were detained at Israeli military bases.
Families of thousands of other Gazan Palestinians working in Israel said they have  , sparking concerns from rights groups that they too might be in detention.
On Friday, Israel returned thousands of workers to Gaza, but details about them are unclear at the moment.
Abu Obeida said the Qassam Brigades will release some foreign captives from Gaza in the coming days without offering specifics.
What are the families of captives saying?
Israeli relatives are increasingly angry over the fate of the captives, especially during the military's large-scale bombing campaign of Gaza, which they say is putting their loved ones' lives at risk.
A representative for the families told Netanyahu they support a full prisoner swap.
'As far as the families are concerned, a deal of a return of our family members immediately in the framework of 'all for all' is feasible, and there will be wide national support for this,' said MeIrav Gonen, the representative.
Israeli families are increasingly angry over the 'absolute uncertainty' they face over the fate of the captives, particularly in the heavy bombings, said Haim Rubinstein, a spokesperson for the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
What has Israel said?
Netanyahu has made no commitment to any deal but told the families of the captives: 'We will exhaust every possibility to bring them home.'
Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas has to be forced to the negotiating table and the issue is 'very complex'.
'The more military pressure, the more firepower and the more we strike Hamas, the greater our chances are to bring it to a place where it will agree to a solution that will allow the return of your loved ones,' he said.

Anwar El Ghazi's contract terminated by Mainz over Israel-Palestine posts

The German football club Mainz 05 has terminated the contract of Anwar El Ghazi over social media posts related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In a statement on Friday, Mainz said that El Ghazi's deal had been ended due to 'comments and posts from the player on social media' without offering further information.
El Ghazi, 28, was previously   by the club over a since-deleted post about the conflict in the Middle East, but was allowed to return to practice earlier this week.
"Stand for what is right, even if it means standing alone," El Ghazi said in a social media post after his termination.
'The loss of my livelihood is nothing when compared to the hell being unleashed on the innocent and vulnerable in Gaza,' he said.

- Anwar El Ghazi (@elghazi1995) November 3, 2023
In a social media post on October 27, he had clarified that 'to the extent my previous statements on social media have been misunderstood, I would like to make clear that I stand for peace and humanity for all'.
Mainz said on Monday they lifted the suspension and were giving him a second chance, saying he spoke out against terrorism of all kinds, including from Hamas, and also did not question Israel's right to exist.
However, in a further social media post on Wednesday, El Ghazi indicated that the club had issued its statement without his permission.
"I do not regret or have any remorse for my position," the player wrote. "I do not distance myself from what I said and I stand, today and always until my last breath, for humanity and the oppressed."
He posted another statement in which he condemned 'the killing of all innocent civilians in Palestine and Israel'.
"There can never be any justification for the killing of over 3,500 children in Gaza in the last three weeks.I and we as a world cannot conscionably (sic) remain silent. We must call for an end to the killing in Gaza now," the post adds.
Prior to El Ghazi's termination on Friday, German prosecutors accused him of 'disturbing public peace by condoning criminal acts in conjunction with incitement to hatred' through his social media posts.

How Israeli bombing turned Gaza's desperate situation into a 'catastrophe'

October 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Two weeks of intense Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip has killed more than 5,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and those who have escaped death are facing hunger and struggling to get basic necessities, such as clean water and medicines.
More than 60 percent  of Gaza residents needed food aid even before the latest Israeli bombing campaign started on October 7 in the wake of deadly Hamas attacks inside Israel.
Gaza, which is 10km (6 miles) wide and 41km (25 miles) long, is home to 2.3 million people who have been under an Israeli land, sea and air blockade since 2007. They have faced five military offensives since Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew from the enclave in 2005.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza has become "catastrophic", UN agencies say, because Israel has cut off supplies of food, water, fuel and electricity.
What is the food situation like in Gaza now?
Gaza's entire population faces food shortages, according to a joint report by the United Nations' World Food Programme (WFP) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
"The destruction [by the Israeli strikes] has severely disrupted the food supply chains in Gaza," it said.
 
Israel has allowed three convoys of aid trucks to cross from Egypt into Gaza, but up to 100 trucks carrying essential aid are waiting in Egypt for approval to leave.
With several bakeries bombed and others shutting down because there isn't enough water or power, UN agencies, including the WFP, are able to provide bread for just one meal a day.
Kifah Qudeh is staying at a shelter run by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) at the Ahmed Abdelaziz School in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. He told Al Jazeera that every two to three days, he is given three pieces of flat bread and is allowed to fill up four bottles of water to sustain his wife and three children.
'We cut one piece of bread in half, and if we have access to jam or something else, we put that inside and give it to the children. If not, it's plain bread. It's not enough to sustain us, but it's all we have,' he said.
Is food scarcity now worse than before?
The situation is dire with no one aware how much longer their limited food supplies will last. Shops that have so far survived air strikes have empty shelves and no way to restock. Many people left their homes in a rush without money after Israel started air strikes on October 7. Not everyone can afford to buy what little is still available.
Food supplies were already limited under Israel's 16-year blockade of Gaza although Qudeh says at least he was able to pick up a bag of six or seven fresh flatbreads every day from Gaza's bakeries. It was enough to feed his family. 'We'd eat this with some canned cheese or hummus if we could get it.'
Even before the current war, food entering Gaza was mainly canned goods and processed foods like 'tinned cheese, potato chips and instant noodles – ultraprocessed foods that are known to cause health issues', Iman Farajallah, a Palestinian psychotherapist based in California, told Al Jazeera.
As a result, Gaza residents suffer from malnourishment, said Yusra Eshaq, a nutritionist based in the United Kingdom.
'Palestinians in Gaza have already been malnourished for years, and for their bodies to now further endure food rationing, it will take a real toll,' she said.
With a dramatic drop in calories, the body will start to break down fat and then later muscle mass. This is the danger zone when organs can start to fail, Eshaq explained.
How has 16 years of the Israeli blockade impacted Gaza?
Farajallah, who grew up in Gaza in the 1990s, said: 'We'd eat a breakfast of locally grown tomatoes and cucumbers, homemade cheese that my mother would make from fresh milk and eggs from the chickens that many homes once kept. It honestly feels like another lifetime."
She left Gaza for California about 20 years ago to continue her studies and become a psychotherapist, but she knows all too well the realities on the ground from her trips back to visit family and from the regular calls in between.
'Palestinians like to eat together as a family and not just dinner but three times a day. We'd have dishes of maqlouba [a layered dish of meat, vegetables and rice] and mansaf [lamb cooked in fermented yogurt] and warak anab [stuffed grape leaves], but later under the Israeli blockade, meat became a rarity only to be consumed on Eid al-Adha, and that was if there was a way for the livestock to enter Gaza,' she said by phone.
Her family who remained in Gaza started to eat less because the processed foods came at a price and the  had begun to suffer from limited trade and travel.
'My sister in Gaza started to change her dishes because of a lack of food. Whereas she may have roasted stuffed chicken with nuts and raisins, under the blockade if she was able to get chicken, she'd boil it to make a simple soup for her kids, a treat for her family, and they'd eat this with bread,' Farajallah said.
Does Gaza still have water?
Gaza has water for now, but it's limited and often   and tastes salty.
Gaza's only subterranean aquifer is exhausted , meaning water is unsanitary to drink and can't be used to water plants.
The UN says 97 percent of Gaza's water does not meet World Health Organization (WHO) standards.
Palestinians living in the enclave have became reliant on private water tanks and small desalination plants for their drinking water.

The last desalination station stopped working on Tuesday when its fuel ran out. Israel said it has renewed its water supplies to southern Gaza, but Palestinians said many water pipes have been damaged in the recent Israeli shelling. And without electricity, water pumps to fill the tanks are not working.
Qudeh said: "We are among the lucky ones. We have some water.' Every two days he is able to fill four plastic bottles of water from UNRWA supplies.
But he's careful to ration for himself and his family.
'We try to stick to a glassful a day. It's difficult not to gulp it down, but we are aware of the situation and have to be careful with what we have to make it last," he said.
Other Palestinians have described on social media  how they are rationing food and making sure children eat and drink first.
If water runs out, how long can one survive?
A WFP nutrition specialist based in Jerusalem told Al Jazeera a healthy adult can live up to 10 days without water and a child up to five days.
Our bodies are made up of 75 percent water, and adults should drink about 2.5 to 3 litres of water a day for their bodies to function at optimum health. But shortages mean people are drinking less water.
Bread and water are keeping Palestinians going, but it's uncertain for how much longer [Dawood Nemer/AFP]
"Yes, we need water for our body to work, from our brains to our kidneys to our hearts. It runs through our blood, our digestive juices, our sweat. And if we don't have it, we die," Eshaq said.
The first effects of dehydration can start on the first day with too little water. "So someone may feel dizzy and light-headed and will have a dry mouth," she said, adding that such a condition can quickly cause reduced cognitive functions.

Russia's UN ambassador calls for ceasefire in Israel-Hamas conflict

Russia's ambassador to the United Nations has called for a "humanitarian ceasefire" in the  , while blaming the United States for the continuing conflict.
The Russian draft resolution, presented to the UN Security Council on Friday, calls for an "immediate" ceasefire and the secure release of all hostages, and "strongly condemns all violence and hostilities directed against civilians and all acts of terrorism".
The draft resolution also calls for humanitarian aid access and the safe evacuation of civilians in need.
The draft was given to the 15-member council during a closed-door meeting on the conflict, according to unnamed diplomats.
"We're convinced that the Security Council must act to put an end to the bloodshed and restart peace negotiations with a view to establishing a Palestinian state as it was supposed to do so long ago," Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said after the closed-door meeting of the Security Council on Friday.
Nebenzia said there were positive responses to the draft resolution among some member states.
He also blamed the United States for bearing "responsibility for the   in the Middle East," and criticised European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen for "turning a blind eye to the Israeli air force attacks on civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip".
Israel   of Gaza shortly after Hamas, the Palestinian political and armed group, launched its deadliest-ever surprise assault on Israel last week that killed at least 1,300 people.
Israel's response has proven even deadlier, with at least 1,900 Palestinians having been killed and the death toll mounting.
The draft resolution comes after countries urged Israel to hold off attacking northern Gaza, where it had ordered more than a million civilians to evacuate, something the UN had called 'impossible'.
The one-page Russian draft resolution reportedly refers to Israel and the Palestinians but does not directly name Hamas.
"They have not consulted anyone and it does not even mention Hamas, so they are clearly not serious or aligned with most council members," a council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, was quoted as saying by Reuters.
A UNSC resolution needs at least nine votes in favour and no vetoes by the US, Britain, France, China or Russia.
Washington has traditionally shielded its top regional ally Israel from any Security Council action.
It was not immediately clear when or if Russia would put the draft resolution to a vote.
As the siege on Gaza continues, the city has been left without water, electricity and internet, and there have been concerns about the rising casualties, which have mostly been women and children.

Tehran, Iran - Demonstrations have been held across Iran to denounce the United States and Israel and to mark the 1979 takeover of the US embassy in Tehran as  .
Saturday marked the 13th day of the Iranian month of Aban, the day the US embassy was stormed by young revolutionaries shortly after the country's 1979 revolution, which birthed the current theocratic establishment in Iran.
The November 4, 1979, takeover, which took place after the fall of Iran's US-backed monarch, lasted 444 days, and 52 Americans were held captive. The site of the US embassy is now accessible to the public as a representation of what Iranian officials call a 'den of spies'.
This day on the Iranian calendar is also known as Students Day and the National Day of Fighting Global Arrogance.
Demonstrators, some of whom were children, started marching in Tehran about 9am (12:30pm GMT) from Palestine Square in the downtown area to the site of the former US embassy a few kilometres away.
State television showed people holding Palestinian flags and others burning Israeli, US and United Kingdom flags. In some places, the US and Israeli flags were put on the ground, so demonstrators could walk over them.
Chants of 'death to America' and 'death to Israel' rang out throughout the marches. One demonstrator could be seen holding a cardboard cutout of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on his knees with his hands behind his head in a sign of surrender.
Revolutionary student groups released statements to condemn the 'atrocities' committed by Israel against Palestinian civilians and to cite a promise made by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in 2015 that Israel would cease to exist by 2040.
State-organised demonstrations were also held in other large cities, including Mashhad, Isfahan, Ardebil and Hamedan, and government ministers and other officials were in attendance. The state-run IRNA news website reported rallies were held in more than 1,200 cities and towns.
Iranian officials have called for an   and operations in Gaza, which have killed more than 9,488 Palestinians, most of them women and children, since the October 7 Hamas attacks, which killed about 1,400 Israelis.
Tehran has   as the 'resistance axis' of forces across the region - including in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Syria - could retaliate against Israel's killing of civilians and promises to destroy Hamas.

Biden says Gaza hospital must be protected as Israeli tanks close in

November 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
United States President Joe Biden has said that Gaza's largest hospital 'must be protected' as Israeli tanks surround the facility with hundreds of patients and staff trapped inside.
Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Biden said he hoped to see Israel take "less intrusive action" at Al-Shifa Hospital, which medical staff say has been repeatedly targeted by Israeli bombing and snipers.
"My hope and expectation is that there will be less intrusive action relative to hospitals and we remain in contact with the Israelis," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office.
"Also, there is an effort to get this pause to deal with the release of prisoners and that's being negotiated, as well, with the Qataris … being engaged," the US President added. "So I remain somewhat hopeful but hospitals must be protected."
Biden's comments came as medics warned of mounting casualties among patients, including newborn babies, at the hospital, which has been encircled by Israeli forces since Saturday.
Witnesses on Monday reported that tanks and armoured vehicles were positioned just metres from the gate of the medical complex, where staff say power outages, dwindling medical supplies and Israeli bombardment have made taking care of patients next to impossible.
At least 32 patients, including six premature babies, have died at the hospital since Friday, Palestinian health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said on Monday.
Three nurses have also been killed at the facility, the UN relief agency in the occupied Palestinian territory said on Sunday.
Israel has claimed that Hamas operates a command centre under the hospital, which the armed group and hospital officials have denied.
Israel's military said on Monday that its soldiers had discovered a weapons cache in a tunnel connected to Rantissi Hospital, a facility for treating children in northern Gaza, sharing a video of what it said were grenades, suicide vests and other explosives.
'Hamas hides in hospitals,' spokesman Daniel Hagari said during a nightly press conference. 'Today, we will expose this to the world.'
Since Sunday, the Al-Shifa,   and Kamal Adwan hospitals have suspended operations due to Israeli bombardment and dwindling supplies of fuel and medicines.
Israel has told civilians to leave Al-Shifa and medics to send patients elsewhere. Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis, said the 'Israeli military is calling on patients to step out of the hospital with their hands above their heads".
'But some of them need wheelchairs while others are disabled, hence cannot walk,' he said. 'It's hard to comprehend these are the demands of the Israeli military, while at the same time [it is] playing nice with the media, telling journalists 'we are offering a safe corridor'.'
Israel has pledged to eliminate Hamas in response to the armed group's October 7 attacks on southern Israeli communities, which Israeli officials say killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
Israel's bombardment and ground operation in Gaza since then have killed at least 11,240 Palestinians, including more than 4,600 children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-governed enclave.

Dozens killed, arrested in West Bank and Gaza raids overnight

Israeli military incursions into Gaza and the West Bank have continued overnight, killing and injuring dozens.
A dozen people were reported killed during a raid early on Wednesday in Gaza's second-largest city Khan Younis. At least five Palestinians were killed and a senior Fatah leader was arrested in overnight raids in the occupied West Bank.
At about dawn, Israeli forces targeted two residential buildings in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, where many have sought refuge after the Israeli army ordered the evacuation of the northern part of the besieged territory.
Medical sources told Al Jazeera 12 people died in the attack, and that more than two dozen were wounded.
Multiple Israeli raids were also staged overnight in the West Bank, where at least five more Palestinians were killed, bringing the death toll in the region to 130 since October, the Palestinian health ministry said.
The largest raid took place in the Jenin refugee camp, in the north of the West Bank, where at least three Palestinians were killed.
'It began around midnight and ended around 7am and was, by far, one of the largest raids we've seen since October 7,' Al Jazeera's Imran Khan reported from Ramallah.
'The Israeli army came in large numbers,' Khan added. 'We're hearing at least 100 troops and multiple armoured vehicles.'
A senior leader of Fatah, a moderate Palestinian rival of Hamas, was also arrested during the raid. Khan called the detention 'unusual'.
'Since October 7, the concentration by the Israeli army has been on Hamas leaders and activists within the occupied West Bank,' our correspondent said. 'So this arrest will have Fatah leaders here in Ramallah very concerned. The family says during the arrest he was beaten up before being taken away.'
Elsewhere, an elderly man was killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank district of Tulkarm early on Wednesday, according to Palestinian media .
The Wafa news agency identified the man killed as Magdy Zakaria Youssef Awad, 65, who was shot by Israeli forces during confrontations with residents of Tulkarm refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. According to the agency, Awad was a physically impaired elderly man.
According to Al Jazeera's Khan, at least 30 people have been arrested in the raids, but the number is likely to rise once the Palestinian Prisoners Society collates final figures.
Al Jazeera Arabic has also reported armed clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians in Qalqilya, in the northwest of the West Bank.
North of Hebron, 16-year-old Abdullah Mohammad Meqbel was shot dead  after Israeli forces fired live ammunition at a group of demonstrators who had taken to the streets to denounce Israel's deadly attacks on Gaza.
The West Bank has suffered increasing levels of violence amid the Israel-Hamas war, including from attacks by Israeli settlers.
In reaction, Palestinians declared a general strike across the territory on Wednesday.
"The most important thing we demand is to stop injustice and tyranny, to stop killing innocent people, and refrain from arbitrary revenge," 26-year-old Ramallah resident Fakhri Muhammad Shreiteh told AFP.
Continued bombardment, communications blackout
The raids came as humanitarian groups denounced   on the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza, renewing their calls for an immediate ceasefire.
The Israeli military said it targeted Hamas infrastructure in the camp "that had taken over civilian buildings". Women and children were seen being rescued from those buildings that were still standing near a massive crater, in footage shot live by Al Jazeera Arabic at the scene.
Palestinian fighters and Israeli forces engaged in heavy fighting in the Zeitoun neighbourhood, located southeast of Gaza City, an Al Jazeera correspondent reported. Shelling continued in northern Gaza as Israeli incursions continued to the north and northwest of the Gaza Strip and the south and southeast of Gaza City.
Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis, said the Strip was plunged into a near-total communications blackout just after midnight on Wednesday, the second such incident since last week. Mahmoud said the north and the south of Gaza have now been cut off from each other.
'The difficult part about this is the inability of knowing exactly what is going on," Mahmoud said. "It's becoming increasingly difficult to understand the situation in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.
'This part of the Gaza Strip has been completely separated by a line of tanks coming from the eastern and southern eastern part of Gaza City, all the way down the coastal road, separating the north from the south.'
So far, at least 8,525 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, including 3,542 children -   than have died in conflicts around the world in each of the last four years.
More than 1,400 people have died in Israel, mostly in the deadly Hamas attack on October 7.

Time running out for Gaza families, with hospitals facing power blackout

Gaza City – With a   enveloping the Gaza Strip, Israeli missiles bombarding the blockaded enclave are no longer the only sounds of death. In hospitals, the beeping of life-saving machines is, to many, also a reminder of increasingly perilous survival.
These machines could, at any moment, fall into a haunting silence.
'My brother, two sisters and parents are slowly fading away right before my eyes, and it's heart-wrenching that I cannot do anything to save them,' said Ahmed Sheikh Ali, whose family survived an attack on their home but are in hospital.
Across the Gaza Strip, hospitals are on the brink of running out of spare fuel, after the Palestinian territory's   stopped functioning on Wednesday following Israel's refusal to allow supplies of fuel.
In a statement to the media earlier on Wednesday, Ashraf Al Qidra, spokesperson of the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, explained that Israel's blockade and the refusal to allow fuel into Gaza are pushing 'our medical operation into a precarious situation'.
Without quick action to restore power, the situation in the hospitals is poised for a 'huge loss of these lives', he said, a stark warning of the potential consequences of the continued power shortages.
At the heart of this crisis are the intensive care units, where thousands of injured people are struggling for their lives. A significant number of them rely on electricity-powered oxygen generators to breathe and survive.
Beyond ICUs, the blackout has also hit efforts to provide aid and maintain emergency communication systems online across the devastated Strip. All of this is deepening a humanitarian crisis.
Refrigerated food, a lifeline for many since the war began, is on the brink of expiration due to the destruction of shopping centres and the incapacity of supermarkets to operate, all because of the power shortages. Over two million people are caught between the ravages of terror and the perils of deprivation.
Efforts to mediate and allow the entry of fuel and vital medical supplies have fallen short. The Gaza Power Plant remains inactive, casting a dark shadow over the Strip's ability to sustain life in the coming days.
The Gaza Power Plant says Israel must lift the blockade and provide access to the fuel that the people so desperately require.
With the power cuts, accessing money through ATMs and banks has become a major challenge. Families yearning to reach their loved ones overseas are left with no means of communication, adding another layer of pain to already unimaginable conditions.
For   in Gaza, access to information, sources and witnesses – the lifeblood of informed reporting – has become increasingly difficult, if not impossible.
Ferial Abdo, a Palestinian journalist in Gaza, shared the challenges of continuing her reporting work amid the harsh conditions of war and power shortages. She explained, 'I haven't been able to write or cover the ongoing developments for an entire day. I strive to conserve as much battery on my phone as I can because once it runs out, I'll have no way to stay connected online.'
'I cannot continue reporting, and that is not only a problem for me, but also for my people. Because if we, as journalists, do not make their voices heard, then the world will not know anything about us,' Abdo added.
Even foreign media outlets based in the Strip find themselves struggling with a severe inability to recharge their essential equipment. Many are relying on personal power banks, which too will soon run out of battery.
So far, efforts to get Israel to allow access to fuel and essential medical supplies into the Gaza Strip have failed. Until that changes, the Gaza Power Plant is likely to remain offline.
For thousands of families like Sheikh Ali's, time is fast running out.

At least six Palestinian journalists killed as Israel bombs Gaza

At least six Palestinian journalists have been killed in a matter of days, amid Israel's ongoing  , media networks and press freedom monitors have said.
Journalist Saeed al-Taweel, editor-in-chief of Al-Khamsa News website, and two other members of the press were killed early on Tuesday as they went to film a building that Israel would soon bomb in Gaza City.
'Unfortunately, they have sent a warning notice to the Hiji building just now that it will be bombed,' al-Taweel said in his last words, shortly before being killed, according to a recording obtained by Al Jazeera. 'The area has been evacuated entirely. Women, men, the elderly, kids have all completely fled the area.'
Al-Taweel, Mohammed Subh and Hisham Alnwajha had been standing at a safe distance, hundreds of metres from the stated target. But the air attack instead hit a different building, much closer to them.
Alnwajha suffered serious injuries and was admitted to the intensive care room at Al-Shifa Medical Complex, the Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
The crew was wearing flak jackets and helmets clearly identifying themselves as members of the press.
Funerals for Subh and al-Taweel were held hours later at a hospital in Gaza City.
As a tribute to their work, the iconic helmets worn by media workers were placed on their bodies, which were covered in white sheets.

Two other journalists, Ibrahim Mohammad Lafi and Mohammad Jarghoun, were shot dead while reporting on Saturday, according to the Palestinian press freedom group MADA and the Journalist Support Committee (JSC), a non-profit that promotes media rights in the Middle East.
Lafi, a photographer for Ain Media, was at the Gaza Strip's Beit Hanoon crossing, known as Erez to Israelis, as Israel and Hamas locked in a new cycle of escalating violence.
Jarghoun, a reporter with Smart Media, was to the east of Rafah city in the southern Gaza Strip.
Meanwhile, freelance journalist Mohammad el-Salhi was shot dead on the border to the east of Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported on Saturday.
Two Palestinian photographers, Nidal al-Wahidi from the Al-Najah channel and Haitham Abdelwahid from the Ain Media agency, have been reported missing since Saturday.
Ibrahim Qanan, a correspondent for Al-Ghad channel, was injured by shrapnel in the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, MADA said.
The Palestinian group denounced 'the persistence of the Israeli occupation forces in committing more serious crimes and attacks against journalists and media outlets in Palestine".
Sherif Mansour of the CPJ called on "all sides to remember that journalists are civilians and should not be targeted". "Accurate reporting is critical during times of crisis and the media has a vital role to play in bringing news from Gaza and Israel to the world."
The CPJ called for an investigation into el-Salhi's death.
About 1,300 people on both sides of the conflict have died since Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, launched a surprise attack on Israeli territory on Saturday.
Israeli shelling has also destroyed the homes of Rami al-Sharafi, the director of Zaman Radio, and Al-Quds Today broadcaster Basil Khair al-Din, MADA reported. Media offices, including the headquarters of Al-Ayyam newspaper in the Palestine Tower, Fadel Shanaa Foundation, Shehab Agency, and Gaza FM Radio were also hit, the group said.
The organisation called for an end to the 'impunity' enjoyed by Israeli authorities as 'the only key to putting an end to the murders of journalists and … attacks that target freedoms and media outlets in Palestine'.
Members of the press have also reportedly been targeted by authorities in Israel.
According to CPJ, on Saturday a television crew for the privately owned Sky News Arabia said they were assaulted and their equipment damaged by Israeli police in the southern city of Ashkelon.
The channel's correspondent, Firas Lutfi, said Israeli police aimed rifles at his head, forced him to remove his clothes, confiscated the team's phones, and made them leave the area under police escort.
Israeli authorities did not reply to CPJ's requests for comment.
The organisation in May published Deadly Pattern, a report into the Israeli practice of targeting Palestinian journalists.
'No one has ever been charged or held responsible for these deaths,' the organisation said.
The May 11, 2022 killing of Al Jazeera correspondent   is part of this 'deadly, decades-long pattern', it said.
Over 22 years, CPJ has documented at least 20 journalist killings by members of the Israeli army.

Arab world speaks out on killing of Al Jazeera journalist's family

October 26th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Mohammad Hussein has been glued to the television in recent weeks, watching Gaza's destruction by Israeli air raids. And when an Israeli air raid killed the family of Al Jazeera Gaza Bureau Chief Wael Dahdouh on Wednesday, Hussein watched the story unfold.
'It's a crime,' the 45-year-old taxi driver said, his left hand fiddling with prayer beads as he sat on a busy throughway in Beirut. '[And a violation] of human rights.'
On Wednesday, the news broke that Dahdouh's family was killed in an attack in southern Gaza. His family had fled northern Gaza to the south on Israel's advice but were killed anyway.
Dahdouh lost his wife, a daughter, a grandson and a 15-year-old son who wanted to follow in his footsteps into journalism. They are among the more than 7,000 people killed – 3,000 of whom are children – in Gaza since the start of the hostilities. The images of Dahdouh entering the morgue and identifying his family members were widely carried on Al Jazeera Arabic.
'It was shocking news,' said Maan Al-Haj Ali, a journalist working for Palestine's WAFA News Agency. 'As if [he] was a member of the family, as if someone very close was broken in front of you.'
'They seek revenge through your children'
To those in Gaza, Dahdouh's presence on their screens has been a constant in recent years. Many in the media praised his work and expressed their sorrow that a man so used to covering the tragedies of others now had to face his own.
"As a journalist and writer, Wael is a beacon of brave reporting and authentic journalism,' Mohammed R Mhawish, a Palestinian journalist and writer based in Gaza, told Al Jazeera. 'I was listening to the live broadcast when he received the news of the killing of his family members. It shocked me to see him break down on screen.'
The attack came only a couple of weeks after US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken reportedly  told Qatar's emir to tone down Al Jazeera Arabic's coverage of the war on Gaza. When he saw his slain family, Dahdouh was recorded saying , 'They seek revenge through our children.'

"The attack isn't on Wael and his family only, but on the entire people of Gaza,' Ahmed al-Yazil, a student of media and mass communications in Gaza, said. 'Israel attempts to shut Wael's and every Palestinian's voice trying to report on the reality of life under occupation and war. But it won't succeed, even if we lost loved ones along the way."
'Why are they targeting journalists?'
The news spread like wildfire on social networks. Users shared images of a distraught Dahdouh or a clip of the anchor who delivered the news nearly breaking down in tears.
'My Instagram is filled with people sharing it since yesterday,' Aya Mhanna, 38, a Lebanese clinical psychologist now living in Istanbul, told Al Jazeera. Mhanna said she recognised Dahdouh from his reporting and lamented that the journalist had become the news. 'It breaks my heart.'
Even those who had not known his name before Wednesday said the story was on everyone's lips. Abdulrahman Bashar Itani sat outside his shop in Beirut next to two other men. 'I watch all the channels,' the sprightly 90-year-old said. 'I didn't see the news but everyone is talking about it.'
Itani also brought up Issam Abdallah, the Lebanese Reuters journalist killed in south Lebanon on October 13. 'Haram,' he said. 'Why are they targeting journalists?'
At least 24 journalists  have been killed in the latest round of hostilities, including 20 Palestinians, three Israelis and Lebanon's Abdallah.

In the West Bank, Palestinians have grown accustomed to Dahdouh's presence and reporting on the decades-long occupation of Palestine and the genocide of its people. Respect and compassion have flowed as he reels from Israel's killing of his family in the south of Gaza.
'It is shameful for the people who … see our children, women and elderly being killed while they are sitting [by],' Ali, the WAFA journalist, said.
'As if the children of Palestine are worthless'
As the eyes of the world have turned to Gaza, Syria is also still suffering air raids, albeit from Russia. Nonetheless, many in Syria were also gripped by the news and took a minute to lend their solidarity.
'The pain and sorrow felt by Wael were felt by all of us despite our distance from him,' Osman al-Khader, a lawyer and activist in the Syrian revolution, said. 'Wael refused to do anything but give us a lesson in patience and courage.'
The Syrian journalist, Hanin al-Sayed, from Idlib, said the Israeli attack on Dahdouh's family brought the killing last year of another stalwart Palestinian journalist to his mind.
'He often reminds me of Shireen Abu Akleh, may she rest in peace,' al-Sayed said. He added that she was 'the voice of truth that was killed by the Israeli army's gunfire, which continues to kill children and women in plain view of the world'.
Dahdouh's pain was evident for the world to see on Wednesday. Many around the region have condemned the continuing assault and attacks on civilians and the mounting death toll that has no immediate end in sight.
'No one is offering anything to help,' Ali said. It is 'as if the children of Palestine and the people of Palestine are worthless'.

Israel pushes thousands of detained cross-border workers into war-torn Gaza

November 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Thousands of Gazans, previously working in Israel and the occupied West Bank and then detained by Israel, are being pushed into the war-torn enclave, news agencies report.
Some of the Gazan workers returned on Friday through the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing in Israel, east of the Rafah border crossing between the besieged Gaza Strip and Egypt, Reuters said.
The office of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday night: "Those workers from Gaza who were in Israel on the day of the outbreak of the war will be returned to Gaza."
Workers crossing into the Palestinian enclave said they were detained and ill-treated by Israeli authorities in the wake of the October 7 attack by Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, on southern Israel. Some still had plastic stickers carrying numbers around their legs.
"We used to serve them, work for them, in houses, in restaurants, and in markets in return for the lowest prices and despite that, we were humiliated," said Jamal Ismail, a worker from the Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip.
Those from areas in northern Gaza would have to stay in the south after Israeli forces completed cutting off roads linking the two parts of the enclave late on Thursday, according to Palestinian officials.
About 18,500 residents of Gaza held permits to work outside the besieged strip before the war broke out.
The exact number of workers present in Israel as hostilities began remains unknown, but thousands are thought to have been rounded up by the Israeli army and transferred to undisclosed locations.
Jessica Montell, executive director of the Israel-based human rights organisation HaMoked,   Al Jazeera in October that more than 400 families and friends of missing labourers from Gaza had been in touch with the organisation since the beginning of the war.
A group of six local organisations, including HaMoked, petitioned Israel's High Court to disclose the names and locations of the detainees and to ensure humane holding conditions.
According to the petitioners, some of the Palestinians were detained in the Almon area as well as in Ofer, near Ramallah, and Sde Teyman, near Beer al-Sabe (Be'er Sheva), in the southern Naqab or Negev desert.
Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from East Jerusalem, says that the legal challenge from human rights groups appears to have convinced Israel to start releasing the workers, with around 3,200 believed to have been taken to the Kerem Shalom crossing.
The same human rights organisations are now saying that sending them to Gaza could well end up being a death sentence, he said.
The UN was also disturbed. "They are being sent back, we don't know exactly to where," and whether they "even have a home to go to", and "we are deeply concerned about that", UN human rights office spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told a press conference.

Displaced Palestinians in overcrowded UN schools face outbreak of disease

Al-Maghazi, Gaza Strip – Days after a UNRWA school in the central Gaza Strip was hit by Israel, killing at least six people, clothes and blankets still hang from the windows and balconies of its other schools, turning the traditional white and blue colours of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency into a patchwork of bright colours.
The schools have become places of refuge for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, many of whom believe that the UN designation of these buildings will keep them safe from the constant Israeli bombardment.
According to the UNRWA, more than 613,000 of 1.4 million internally displaced people in Gaza are sheltering in 150 of its facilities across the blockaded territory.
But severe overcrowding, a lack of privacy and inadequate sanitation have put these schools at risk of a prolonged and severe public health crisis, adding pressure to the already overloaded healthcare system which doctors and the health ministry describe as being in a state of total collapse.
And now, with the bombing of the school in the al-Maghazi refugee camp, in which dozens were injured, it is clear that schools may not be the places of sanctuary humanitarian agencies hoped for.
'This is outrageous, and it again shows a flagrant disregard for the lives of civilians," Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner-General, said. "No place is safe in Gaza any more, not even UNRWA facilities.
'At least 4,000 people have taken refuge in this UNRWA school-turned-shelter. They had and still have nowhere else to go."
The displaced people in these schools also lack access to life necessities such as water, electricity, food, milk, nappies and essential supplies for period health including sanitary pads, disinfectants and pain relief.
The UN agency said that some shelters are currently hosting 10 to 12 times more people than their capacity.
One school in Khan Younis is hosting 21,000 people. Noor and her family are staying at another school in the southern city, which has approximately 6,000 individuals, or about 1,100 families housed within it. According to those managing the shelter, just over half of the occupants are men, who sleep outside in the playground. Women and children sleep in the classrooms.
"Each classroom has about 50 people," Noor, who preferred not to give her last name, said. "We sometimes have two hours of electricity, depending on the generators. There's also a shortage of water most of the time."
The 25-year-old and her seven-member family were forced to leave their home in the Abasan neighbourhood, on the eastern fringes of Khan Younis in the southern part of the Gaza Strip.
Their house was severely damaged after an Israeli air raid targeted a neighbour's home, and the family has been living in the UNRWA school in Khan Younis ever since.
"We sought refuge in UNRWA schools with the hope of finding safety, but we found ourselves in an environment ripe for the outbreak of diseases and impending health crises as well as being plagued by constant Israeli aerial and artillery bombardments, day and night," Noor said.
Displaced Palestinians began taking refuge in this school during the early days of the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip, after a surprise attack on October 7 by Hamas on Israel killed 1,405 Israelis. Over the past 20 days, at least 7,028 Palestinians have been killed in the onslaught, most of them women and children.

'Experiencing menstruation is a nightmare'
Several of the UNRWA schools have been   from Israeli air raids in their vicinities.
Already, the overcrowding and unsuitable hygiene facilities in the makeshift accommodations have led to an outbreak of scabies and smallpox among the displaced population.
The lack of basic hygiene, especially for women, compounds the dire circumstances, especially when it comes to menstruation.
In addition to the physical discomfort associated with periods such as headaches, joint pain, and abdominal and back pain, there is also added psychological distress, worsened by the constant fear the women and girls are experiencing under Israeli shelling.
"Menstruation in the shelter school feels like a nightmare," Noor said. "There are no blankets, no comfortable mattresses, no sanitary pads, no pain relievers and no access to hot water to make soothing beverages.
"Some girls within these shelters are resorting to taking medication to prevent their menstruation, aiming to avoid the embarrassment and added pain," she added.
For those who have their period but have little to no access to sanitary products, a distressing practice has emerged where some girls and women have resorted to washing and reusing sanitary pads, inadvertently risking their health due to potential contamination.

Bleak situation
In another UNRWA school in al-Maghazi, Amal, her husband and their three young boys are struggling to find the basics.
While UNRWA continues to provide some assistance in shelters, the total siege of the Gaza Strip and the unrelenting bombing have severely constrained access to essential services, which in turn represent a health risk for the displaced Palestinians.
Amal, who said she was afraid to give her last name for fear of Israel targeting her family, was forced to leave her house in the Shati (Beach) refugee camp west of Gaza City on October 13. Her house had been damaged by Israeli bombing, its windows shattered and the doors blown out.
They fled to al-Maghazi in search of safety, but the journey was terrifying, with bombs falling from the sky above. Some families rode in trucks and were targeted by Israeli missiles and killed, while other men, women and children were running in the street.
The only thing Amal could take was an emergency bag, in which she placed their identification cards and some items for her youngest son, Karim, who is not yet one year old.

"The situation in UNRWA schools is so bleak," Amal said. "I'm struggling to find the right size of diapers for my son. We aren't receiving any aid for children, and I don't even have milk to feed him."
Amal said she has resorted to using cloths instead of nappies for her son, which has given him severe rashes.
She added that she avoids eating even the smallest amounts of tuna and bread provided by UNRWA so she won't need to use the toilet. Due to a lack of sufficient blankets, her other two children, aged seven and five, now have colds and colic.
'I can't bear the situation we are living in," Amal said. "The war is very cruel, and we hear the sounds of bombing all day long."

A truce between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas will begin on Friday morning, with civilian captives set to be released from Gaza later in the day, a spokesman for Qatar's foreign ministry has said.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said that the temporary truce will begin at 7am (05:00 GMT) and that 13 captives held by Hamas will be released at 4pm (14:00 GMT).
'Those hostages who are from the same families will be put together within the same patch,' he said.
'Every day will include a number of civilians as agreed to total 50 within the four days.'
Palestinians would be released from Israeli prisons as part of the deal, which also includes a cessation of hostilities across Gaza, he said.
Al-Ansari said the Red Cross was coordinating with all parties involved with the release of the captives held in Gaza.
'Our main objective here is the safety of the hostages,' he said.
The armed wing of Hamas confirmed in a statement on Telegram that the truce would start at 7am local time.
The truce would last for four days, during which all military actions by al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' armed wing, and Israeli forces would cease, the statement added.
The Israeli prime minister's office said said Israel received an initial list of hostages to be released from Gaza.
"The relevant authorities are checking the details of the list and are presently in contact with all the families," it said in a statement.

'Bulletproof': The brief, beautiful life of Danielle Waldman

As the daughter of Israeli tech billionaire, philanthropist and peace ambassador Eyal Waldman, 24-year-old Danielle inherited her father's belief that Jews and Arabs could work together. He hired more than 200 Palestinian engineers at Mellanox, the tech firm he co-founded in 1999 and led until 2020, believing that working together could lead to peace.
'Danielle was the same as me. She believed we must strive for peace. She worked with me as often as she could,' Eyal, who raised $360,000 for an oncology ward at a Gaza hospital in 2020, recalls.
'She always thought that doing good things for other people was the best way to be. She knew many of my Palestinian friends and was friends with them, too, and she was always thinking of other people without thinking of herself. She helped so many people during her short life.'
Danielle was with her boyfriend, 26-year-old Noam Shay, at the Supernova music festival which was taking place close to kibbutz Re'im near the Gaza border when it was attacked by Hamas on October 7. Some   and 40 were taken hostage by Hamas, according to the first Israeli police report into the attack.
Danielle and Noam had met six years earlier when they were both serving in the Israeli military and had been inseparable ever since.
'They had just started talking about getting married,' Eyal explains. 'But instead of a wedding, we held a funeral and buried them together.'

Many of the hundreds of Israeli, Palestinian citizens of Israel and foreigners murdered by Hamas fighters at the Supernova music festival sent their loved ones text and voice messages saying goodbye. But Eyal didn't even have that.
'I didn't get to say goodbye to her. She sent a text message to say she was OK at 6:30am.That was the last we heard of her.At least I have that,' he says. 'I also have a video of when they were in the car before they were murdered and an audio recording from one of her friends who was wounded. But by that time,shewas probablyalreadydead."
'Danielle was amazing.She couldn't hurt a fly and she loved everyone. Anyone who came into contact with her loved her, too,' he says.
"My ex-wife [Danielle's mother] called me the other day to tell meshe had a dream abouttheir wedding,' Eyal says, choking up with tears.
Despite his unbearable loss, Eyal says he does not regret working with Palestinians and remains optimistic that the day will come when the two people will coexist in peace. He also has reason to believe the current war may turn out to be a catalyst or trigger for reconciliation: 'After the [Yom Kippur] war of 1973, we started the peace process with Egypt and signed an agreement with them. There's no reason that cannot happen again. We need to resolve this conflict. We've been killing each other for 75 years.'
When asked about the memory of his daughter he holds most dear, he recalls a skiing holiday in France when Danielle began dancing spontaneously.
'She loved to dance. She was dancing all the time," he says. "I just posted a video from that day when she was dancing in France and my three kids joined in. It was the song, Titanium, that says 'I'm bulletproof'. It's the best memory I have.'

October 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
At least 500 people have been killed in an Israeli air raid on al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities in the besieged territory.
Several world leaders have condemned the attack.
Here are some of the early key reactions:
Palestine
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas denounced the air raid as an act of 'genocide' and a 'humanitarian catastrophe'.
Abbas has also withdrawn from a previously scheduled meeting with US President Joe Biden, who is set to arrive in the region on Wednesday.
Jordan
In a statement on Tuesday, the Jordanian foreign ministry strongly condemned Israel's attack and emphasised the need for international protection for Palestinian civilians and an end to the fighting.
King Abdullah II said Israel's bombing of Gaza hospital was a "massacre" and a "war crime" that one cannot be silent about.
Egypt
The Egyptian government has issued a statement denouncing the attack "in the strongest terms", calling on the international community to step in and prevent further violations.
Qatar
Qatar's foreign ministry said the attack marked a dangerous escalation.
"The expansion of Israeli attacks over the Gaza Strip to include hospitals, schools, and other population centres is a dangerous escalation," the statement reads.
World Health Organization (WHO)
"WHO strongly condemns the attack on Al Ahli Arab Hospital", the UN health agency's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on the social media platform X, adding that early reports indicate "hundreds of deaths and injuries".
"We call for the immediate protection of civilians and health care, and for the evacuation orders to be reversed."

The Arab League
Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said that international leaders must "stop this tragedy immediately" in response to the attack.
"What diabolical mind intentionally bombards a hospital and its defenceless inhabitants?" he wrote in a social media post, saying that "Arab mechanisms will document these war crimes and the criminals will not get away with their actions."
Turkey
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denounced the attack in a statement on social media.
'Hitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel's attacks devoid of the most basic human values,' he said.
'I invite all humanity to take action to stop this unprecedented brutality in Gaza.'
Canada
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the attack and stressed the importance of adhering to the laws of war.
"The news coming out of Gaza is horrific and absolutely unacceptable … international law needs to be respected in this and in all cases. There are rules around wars and it's not acceptable to hit a hospital,' Trudeau told reporters.
Iran
Iran's foreign ministry has denounced the air raid as an attack on 'unarmed and defenceless people", Iranian state media reported.

Thousands of people have rallied in Tel Aviv, asking for the release of Israeli and foreign captives being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and criticising the Israeli government for the way it is dealing with the crisis.
Many of the protesters on Saturday were friends and family members of the   and demanded their immediate return.
'Mr Prime Minister, cabinet members, do not talk to me about conquering, do not talk to me about flattening [Gaza]. Do not talk at all. Just take action bring them home now,' Noam Perry, whose father was abducted from the town of Nir Oz, told the crowd at the protest, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.
'They ask us who our rage is directed at and it is all of humanity but mainly, those who are responsible for us, those who have a contract with us,' said Jack Levy, another protester.
More than 240 people, including Israeli soldiers and civilians as well as foreigners, were abducted during   on southern Israel on October 7 that authorities say killed  , mostly civilians.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the idea of any ceasefire 'without the return of our hostages'. The United States has advocated instead for '  ' to allow civilians to flee and for aid delivery.

In remarks on Saturday, Netanyahu ruled out a role for the Palestinian Authority (PA) government in Gaza once the war against Hamas is over.

Labour leader's refusal to call for Gaza ceasefire derails opposition party

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Glasgow, United Kingdom – The leader of the United Kingdom's main opposition party, Labour, has refused to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, a position that is costing him political support and could dent his chances in a new general election.
In recent months, Sir Keir Starmer's traditionally left-wing party has enjoyed a considerable lead over the UK's governing, right-wing Conservatives in opinion polls.
But since Israel began its deadly campaign of retaliatory air raids against Hamas on the impoverished Gaza Strip, the former director of public prosecutions (DPP) for England and Wales has been navigating the most volatile period of his three years at the party's helm.

Late on Tuesday, shadow minister Imran Hussain quit Labour's front bench in protest at Starmer's refusal to heed calls from many in his party to push for an Israeli ceasefire.
About 50 Labour Party councillors, many Muslim, had earlier resigned from party itself over Starmer's position, with some even calling for him to step down.
Starmer, who remains odds-on to become the UK's prime minister in the country's next general election, joined other Western leaders in branding the October 7 attacks by Hamas on southern Israel as 'terrorism'.
However, weeks into the Israeli state's bombardment of the Hamas-controlled enclave, where more than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed in some four weeks of merciless shelling, the Labour leader has been fending off accusations of supporting a 'genocide'.
'Massive divisions within the party'
Starmer's woes began after he gave an interview to British broadcaster LBC several weeks ago, in which he appeared to endorse Israel's military tactic of withholding water and electricity from the people of Gaza.
The presenter asked him if "cutting off power, cutting off water" was appropriate as a response to the   attacks.
Starmer replied, "I think that Israel does have that right … It is an ongoing situation. Obviously, everything should be done within international law."
Starmer later tried to clarify his remarks, saying he understood his words had caused "real concern and distress in some Muslim communities".
"Let me clear about what I was saying, and what I wasn't saying," he said. "I was saying Israel had the right to self-defence. When I said that right, it was that right to self-defence… I was not saying Israel had the right to cut off water, food, fuel, or medicines, on the contrary."
But the damage had already been done.
'The [Labour] resignations show the massive divisions within the party,' Chris Doyle, director of the London-based Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU), toldAl Jazeera.
'The anger against the leader himself is very personal and is very directed at Keir Starmer for his failure to call a ceasefire, but also to condemn the siege [of Gaza] and his failure to criticise Israel for any of its actions.'
Afrasiab Anwar, the Labour leader of Burnley Council, in England's northwest, is among those who have resigned.
Quitting was 'the most difficult decision' of his political career, he told Al Jazeera.
'It was the LBC interview that sparked it all,' said Anwar, who believes Starmer has 'failed' at Labour leader's first real foreign policy test.
'And his response to that and the backlash which came from that. He's been trying to recover [ever since] and has failed to do so.'
After assuming control of Labour in April 2020, Starmer set about dismantling the legacy of his pro-Palestinian socialist predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn.
By stark contrast, this week, Corbyn, a lifelong supporter of Palestinian rights,   a column published by Al Jazeera in which he argued that the International Criminal Court should investigate possible war crimes in Gaza.
But like Starmer, Corbyn has been heavily criticised, accused by some in the party of failing to deal properly with internal complaints of anti-Semitism.
Starmer has been on a path to detach Labour from the Corbyn era.
Just two months after his term began, Starmer sacked his shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, for retweeting an interview with an actor that he said contained an anti-Jewish conspiracy theory.
He also oversaw the suspension of Corbyn after the former Labour chief was accused of downplaying the findings of a report  on anti-Semitism in the Party during his time as leader.
Last month, Labour legislator Andy McDonald was suspended by Starmer for chanting the pro-Palestinian rallying cry 'between the  ' during a speech at a Gaza solidarity march.
To many observers, these suspensions and Starmer's opposition to a ceasefire in Gaza signal his staunch support for the Israeli state.
Longtime pro-Palestinian supporter Pauline McNeill, who sits as a Scottish Labour Party politician in the devolved Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, told Al Jazeera, 'Isaac Herzog, who is president of Israel and an Israeli Labour Party politician, said three weeks ago there was no such thing as an innocent Palestinian civilian … And I actually do wonder if Keir Starmer is listening to any of this.
"I do hope that the Labour Party comes to realise that [there is a] massacre happening right now in Gaza.'
Late last month, 250 Muslim Labour councillors wrote to Starmer demanding that he press for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Whether the UK's Muslim communities, many of which traditionally vote for the Labour Party and support the Palestinian cause, will revolt against the party in a general election, remains to be seen.
'Gaza has proven a wake-up call to people around me in my community in terms of who will deliver for their interests,' said Aamir Darr, the founder of the Multicultural Bookshop in Bradford, a northern English city where some 30 percent of residents are Muslim.
'And I think the resignation of the Labour councillors, and the Labour shadow minister, is just the first step.'

Israeli forces have bombed the densely packed   in north Gaza for the second day in a row, following a previous assault that killed dozens of people and wounded many others.
Palestinian authorities said "dozens of people were killed and wounded" in the attack on Wednesday.
Footage from the scene of the attack showed people standing around large craters as rescue workers and volunteers dug through piles of rubble with their hands searching for people and bodies trapped under collapsed buildings.
The news outlet AFP reported that rescuers said that 'whole families' had been wiped out in the attack.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
 
More than 50 people were killed and dozens of others wounded in the   on Tuesday, according to Palestinian authorities and the director of the Indonesian Hospital, which received some of the casualties.
Mohamed Abu Al-Qumsan, a broadcast engineer with Al Jazeera's bureau in Gaza, lost 19   in the attack.
The Palestinian armed group Hamas said that seven captives, taken during the group's deadly incursion into Israel on October 7 that Israeli authorities say killed more than 1,400 people and took more than 200  , were killed in the bombing on Tuesday.
"Seven detainees were killed in the Jabalia massacre yesterday, including three holders of foreign passports," the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said in a statement on Wednesday.
Israel has defended the Tuesday attack on Jabalia, which   from human rights organisations and Middle Eastern nations such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates, stating that it was targeting a Hamas commander in the area.
Israel said its warplanes had hit a "vast" tunnel complex at the site, killing "many Hamas terrorists," including local battalion commander Ibrahim Biari.
The UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths described the attack as an "atrocity".
"This is just the latest atrocity to befall the people of Gaza where the fighting has entered an even more terrifying phase, with increasingly dreadful humanitarian consequences," he said.
In a social media post on Wednesday, the European Union's top diplomat,  , said that he was 'appalled by the high number of casualties following the bombing by Israel of the Jabalia refugee camp'.
While Borrell reiterated the EU's support for Israel, he said that 'laws of war and humanity must always apply'.

Is Israeli bombing of Gaza a violation of international laws?

October 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
International rights experts are raising the alarm over the indiscriminate nature of the Israeli military offensive in Gaza that has killed 1,100 Palestinians and destroyed schools and hospitals while the besieged enclave remains under a blockade.
Activists say the Israeli government's decision to cut power, water and fuel supply to the enclave amounts to collective punishment of its entire population of 2.3 million people and violates international laws.
Israel says no water and fuel will be restored until Hamas returns Israeli captives taken on Saturday following the deadliest attack inside Israel carried out by the Palestinian armed group.
At least 1,200 Israelis have been killed and 3,000 injured after Hamas fighters entered Israel using paragliders and went on a gun rampage in neighbourhoods close to the Gaza border fence. An estimated 150 people have been taken as captives by the Palestinian fighters.

US President Joe Biden has announced to send munitions to Israel after promising "unwavering" support to the country in the wake of the Hamas attack. According to media reports, in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden held back from urging Israel to exercise restraint during its military offensive.
'We uphold the laws of war,' said the US president in a speech that same day.
But what, precisely, are the laws of war? And are they being upheld as Israeli bombing has killed at least 260 children and 230 women?
What are the laws of war?
According to Human Rights Watch, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is regarded as an 'ongoing armed conflict' under international humanitarian law, governed by Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Convention, supplemented by the Additional Protocols of 1977.
These laws of war forbid collective punishment of a population. At their most basic level, they say warring parties must:
Distinguish between combatants and civilians
Preserve civilian infrastructure, such as homes, schools and hospitals
Give prior warning of attacks if civilians are present in targeted locations
Refrain from harming medical staff and depriving medical facilities of electricity and water
Allow the passage of impartial humanitarian aid
Leave civilians and captured combatants unharmed. Murder, cruel treatment, torture and the taking of hostages are forbidden
Power imbalances between parties are not taken into account, meaning that Hamas and the Israeli government would be judged solely on the basis of their actions.
Hamas's killing of civilians and its capture of hostages have been widely condemned. Now, international attention is turning to Israel's indiscriminate hammering of the entrapped population of the Gaza Strip, the suffering set to escalate further with the impending ground offensive.

Is Israel breaking the laws of war?
Israel's actions over the past few days have raised alarm bells.
On Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant called Palestinians a '  ', ordering a 'complete siege' of the Gaza Strip - 'no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed'. Tuesday's air strikes on the Rafah border post with Egypt reportedly impeded trucks with fuel and food from entering Gaza.
Gallant told troops massed at the border with Gaza that he had 'released all restraints'. 'Hamas wanted a change in Gaza, it will change 180 degrees from what it thought,' he threatened. Gaza, he said, would never return to what it was.
Gaza, already under blockade for the past 16 years, has indeed hit new lows, plunged into darkness after the territory's only power station ran out of fuel. Aerial targets include refugee camps, residential blocks, and critical infrastructure such as the telecommunications company, hospitals and schools that provide the sole form of shelter for displaced Gazans - 340,000 and rising fast.
Deprived of electricity and running out of medicine, the territory's hospitals are unable to treat the wounded – 5,339 people at the last count.
'We are suffering and the world is not moving a finger. This is an SOS to the whole world," said a representative of al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City on Wednesday. Marwan Jilani, director general of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, spoke of a 'deliberate targeting' of four emergency workers.
"Crucial life-saving supplies – including fuel, food and water – must be allowed into Gaza. We need rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access now," the UN chief posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday.

On Tuesday, UN rights chief Volker Turk called the conflict 'an explosive powder keg'. 'The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,' he said.
"There's history here that makes Israel's actions especially egregious," said Srinivas Burra, a professor of law at the South Asian University in New Delhi, India.
The laws applied equally to Hamas and Israel, he said. But, he added, Israel's decision to deprive the Gaza Strip's population of basic commodities carried particular weight because of its historic role as enforcer of a blockade against the coastal enclave. He considered the total siege to be a clear violation of international humanitarian law.
How is the international community responding?
The International Criminal Court announced on Tuesday that its 2014 mandate to investigate alleged war crimes committed in 'the State of Palestine' extends to the current conflict. Prosecutors are gathering information for their probe.
Breaking: @IntlCrimCourt  Prosecutor's Office speaks out, making clear that crimes committed in the current context fit within their mandate, that they're gathering information as part of their formal probe into serious crimes in Palestine & encouraging victims to come forward. https://t.co/bSJBmBlwQm
- Omar Shakir (@OmarSShakir) October 10, 2023
Under the court's statute, starvation under siege is considered a war crime. One example is Bashar al-Assad's "kneel or starve" strategy to force the opposition to buckle during the civil war. Currently, human rights lawyers are mounting a dossier against Russia's weaponisation of food in Ukrainian towns Chernihiv and Mariupol to submit to the court.
The UN's Human Rights Council announced it already has 'clear evidence' of war crimes committed by both sides. On Gaza, it said: 'The Commission is gravely concerned with Israel's announcement of a complete siege on Gaza which will undoubtfully cost civilian lives and constitutes collective punishment.' An Independent InternationalCommission of Inquiryis investigating.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Egypt was discussing plans with the US and others to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, but rejected moves to set up safe corridors for refugees fleeing Gaza. One of the sources said this was to protect 'the right of Palestinians to hold on to their cause and their land'.
Sami Abou Shehadeh, a former member of the Israeli Knesset, has blamed Biden and other leaders for giving Israel 'a green light for ethnic cleaning'.
Writing in the London-based al-Araby al-Jadeed, he said: 'Israel is not killing the Hamas leadership; they are not getting revenge out of Hamas. There is collective punishment for 2.2 million people.'

Braverman slammed after calling UK pro-Palestine protesters 'hate marchers'

Suella Braverman, the British home secretary, has faced criticism after describing pro-Palestine protesters as 'hate marchers' and accusing police of double standards.
London has witnessed   over the past month, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets to denounce Israel's relentless bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip and demand the United Kingdom government call for a ceasefire.
This Saturday's planned protest coincides with Armistice weekend, an annual remembrance of World War I when many in the UK pause to remember the victims of war.
Despite pressure from the government, the Metropolitan Police said they could not legally ban the march, saying there was insufficient intelligence that there would be a risk of public disorder.
Protest organisers say Saturday's rally will not be passing through theCenotaph, Britain's national war memorial in central London, and will happen in the afternoon after a minute of silence is held at 11am.
But in a highly unusual attack, Braverman on Wednesday accused police of being more lenient towards pro-Palestinian demonstrations, arguing that right-wing and nationalist protesters are treated differently.
'I do not believe that these marches are merely a cry for help for Gaza," Braverman wrote in an article published by the Times newspaper.
"They are an assertion of primacy by certain groups – particularly Islamists – of the kind we are more used to seeing in Northern Ireland. Also disturbingly reminiscent of Ulster are the reports that some of Saturday's march group organisers have links to terrorist groups, including Hamas."

Braverman's comments drew heavy criticism, including from opposition politicians and activists.
'Suella Braverman is out of control," Yvette Cooper, of the main opposition Labour Party, wrote on X. "Her article tonight is a highly irresponsible, dangerous attempt to undermine respect for police at a sensitive time, to rip up operational independence & to inflame community tensions. No other Home Secretary of any party would ever do this."
David Lammy, a Labour MP, said Braverman was looking to 'exploit the sensitivities of this moment, and an ignorance to Northern Ireland's history … for her own leadership campaign".
Suella Braverman seeking to exploit the sensitivities of this moment, and an ignorance of Northern Ireland's history, to inflame community tensions for her own leadership campaign is an appalling new low.
Rishi Sunak must sack her. But he's too weak.
- David Lammy (@DavidLammy) November 9, 2023
Critics say Braverman is trying to position herself for a party leadership contest that could come if the Conservatives lose power in an election that is expected next year. Opinion polls for months have put the party 15 to 20 points behind Labour.
British actor and comedian Adil Ray described Braverman's column as "astonishing".
"When the police are trying to allow the right to protest & control tensions, the last person they expect to inflame them is the home secretary," Ray said.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who had previously called the protests on Armistice weekend 'disrespectful', backtracked on Wednesday after meeting police chief Mark Rowley and conceded that people had a 'right to peacefully protest'.
In a statement, Sunak said: 'The test of that freedom is whether our commitment to it can survive the discomfort and frustration of those who seek to use it, even if we disagree with them. We will meet that test and remain true to our principles."

Israel's energy minister has vowed that Tel Aviv will not allow essential resources or humanitarian aid into Gaza until Hamas releases captives.
'Humanitarian aid to Gaza? No electric switch will be turned on, no water tap will be opened and no fuel truck will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home,' Israel Katz said on Thursday.
Hamas is believed to have captured dozens of Israelis, foreigners and dual nationals on Saturday during the armed group's biggest attack on Israel in decades.
On Wednesday night, al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, released a video appearing to show the  . Israel dismissed the video as 'theatrics' intended to distract from the group's "true face as a barbaric organisation".
Israel has pledged to eradicate Hamas and announced a 'full siege' on the Gaza Strip in retaliation for Saturday's attack, which Israeli officials say killed more than 1,300 people and wounded some 3,000.
Israeli's air campaign on the enclave has killed more than 1,200 people and injured more than 5,000 others, according to Palestinian authorities.
Gaza's sole electric power station has been switched off, and over-capacity hospitals are running out of fuel.
'The human misery caused by this escalation is abhorrent, and I implore the sides to reduce the suffering of civilians,' International Committee of the Red Cross regional director Fabrizio Carboni said on Thursday.
'As Gaza loses power, hospitals lose power, putting newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen at risk. Kidney dialysis stops, and x-rays can't be taken. Without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues.'

Thousands of Israeli reservists have been called up in preparation for a possible ground assault on Gaza.
On Thursday, Israeli military spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Hecht said no invasion decision had been made, 'but we're preparing for it'.
Hecht told reporters that Palestinian gunmen were still trying to enter Israel by sea, and the military was continuing efforts to secure the Gaza gate.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition leader Benny Gantz on Wednesday agreed to form a unity government.
'At this time, we are all the soldiers of Israel,' Gantz said, describing their partnership as not political but a "shared fate."
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken landed in Israel on Thursday to show solidarity with Washington's ally, seek to prevent the war from spreading and push for the release of captives.

Analysis: Why did Hamas attack now and what is next?

October 11th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
On October 7, Hamas launched a massive military operation into Israeli territory. The shooting of thousands of rockets into Israel was followed by an attack by land, air and sea, with fighters penetrating deep into territory under Israeli control. They attacked military installations and temporarily took over various settlements. The death toll among Israelis has exceeded 1,200, including more than 120 soldiers; dozens of Israeli hostages were also taken into the Gaza Strip.
The planning of the operation took somewhere between a few months and two years, per different accounts from Hamas leaders. The depth and magnitude of the attack were unprecedented and took Israel by surprise. It was a reaction to changing regional dynamics and growing Israeli aggression.
While Hamas may appear to have fulfilled its declared short-term goals of deterring Israeli violations of Al-Aqsa Mosque and taking hostages to bargain for the release of Palestinian political prisoners held in Israeli jails, it does not appear to have a long-term end game. A heavy-handed response by Israel is ongoing – already claiming more than 950 Palestinian lives – but sooner or later it will have to end with mediation.
Why did Hamas attack now?
Hamas's move was triggered by three factors. First, the policies of the far-right Israeli government enabling settler violence in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem led to a sense of desperation among Palestinians and growing demands for a reaction. At the same time, the rising tensions in the West Bank caused by these policies necessitated the shift of Israeli forces away from the south and into the north to guard the settlements. This gave Hamas both a justification and an opportunity to attack.
Second, the Hamas leadership felt compelled to act due to the acceleration of Arab-Israeli normalisation. In recent years, this process further diminished the significance of the Palestinian issue for Arab leaders who became less keen on pressuring Israel on this matter.
If a Saudi-Israeli normalisation deal had been concluded, it would have been a turning point in the Arab-Israeli conflict, which may have eliminated the already weak chances of a two-state solution. This was also part of Hamas's calculations.
Third, Hamas was emboldened after it managed to repair its ties with Iran. In recent years, the movement had to reconsider the political position it assumed in the wake of the Arab Spring in 2011, in opposition to Iran and its ally, the Syrian regime.
Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah has said that he was personally involved in improving the relations between Hamas and Damascus. A Hamas delegation visited Damascus in October 2022 and its political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh travelled to Beirut in April and Tehran in June. Just last month, Nasrallah hosted the Secretary-General of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Ziad al-Nakhalah and the deputy chief of Hamas's political bureau Saleh al-Arouri.
Will there be a united front around Hams?
Iran has denied direct involvement in Hamas's operation but it has expressed support for it. Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general Yahya Rahim Safavi said  'we support this operation, and we are sure that the resistance front also supports this issue'.
However, Hamas's realignment with the 'resistance axis' does not necessarily mean there will be a united front on the ground confronting Israel. Hezbollah, for example, has not joined the fight. Currently, domestic politics in Lebanon are not conducive to a conflict with Israel, which is holding the Lebanese group back.
What Hezbollah is trying to do is to deter the Israeli army from going too far in its revenge against Hamas in Gaza, hence it is increasing the pressure on the Lebanese border. Its shelling of Israeli positions is most probably meant to have a psychological effect than a military one. It has also chosen not to overreact in relation to the killing of three of its members by Israeli bombardment.
However, both Israel and Hezbollah are on alert and tensions are high, which means miscalculations can happen.
What is Hamas's end game?
Three days into Hamas's surprising and overwhelming attack, it is not clear what its end game is and what it can do to reap long-term benefits. Its priority has seemed to be to take both military and civilian hostages to help deter aggressive Israeli retaliation and later exchange them for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
However, Israel does not appear to be deterred. Hamas spokesperson Abu Ubaida has said that Israeli bombardment has killed four Israeli citizens held in Gaza. He has also  that the movement will start killing hostages if Israel strikes civilian homes in Gaza without warning; this might backfire against Hamas if implemented.
The Hamas leadership has said that the objectives of the attacks are ending 'Israeli violations', securing the release of Palestinian prisoners, and 'returning to the project of establishing a state'. Hamas may be able to secure a prisoner swap deal with Israel, although, in the past, many of those released from Israeli prisons had been quickly rearrested. But the group does not have a clear roadmap for moving forward on 'establishing a state' and it cannot have one separately from the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank.
What is next?
Israel has struggled to recover from the attack. It has intensified its bombardment of the Gaza Strip and announced a total blockade on the coastal enclave, turning off electricity and blocking humanitarian aid. Netanyahu's government was already facing domestic turmoil before the attack due to its judicial reforms; its stability will now be tested even further.
Israel will have to decide whether to undertake a ground invasion and if it is worth the military and political costs. Whether it proceeds with it or not, sooner or later its military operation, including the excessive bombardment of the strip, will have to come to an end. At that point, Israel will have to ask for Egypt to mediate some kind of conclusion of this escalation and a deal to exchange prisoners.
When the Israeli assault ends, Hamas, which has gained more legitimacy in Gaza and the West Bank with its operation, will also face the challenge of translating it into policies and governance that would serve the Palestinians in the long term.
The United States, for its part, will have to put its normalisation mediation plans on hold for now. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was expected in Israel and Saudi Arabia later this month to discuss normalisation talks, but his plans have changed and now include a visit to Jordan.
Given the current public mood in the Arab world after the Gaza attack, it would be too complicated to advance talks on a Saudi-Israeli deal. Most probably, these talks will be put on the shelf by the Saudis in the short term but not necessarily fully cancelled.
These developments work in Iran's favour. With the progress of Arab-Israeli normalisation halted, Tehran can now pressure the US into re-entering a nuclear deal of some kind that would take some of the sanctions pressure off the Iranian economy.
Whatever mediation happens between Israel and Hamas eventually, it is unlikely to address the root causes of the conflict. There does not seem to be any political will within Israel to address issues like the imprisonment of Palestinians, the freezing of Palestinian funds, the dire socioeconomic conditions in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, or the continuing settlement expansion. This means the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will continue to fester and produce cycles of violence.

Three years on, how have the Abraham Accords done for the UAE?

September 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Three years ago, theUnited States mediated an agreement between the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Israel, promising to normalise ties between these Arab Gulf states and Israel.
Since formalising the Abraham Accords in September 2020, the UAE and Israel have deepened their relations across a number of economic domains, as well as defence. Months after the two Arab nations signed on, two more joined the accords, Morocco and Sudan, and it seemed like the US was possibly on track to sign up even more Arab countries.
But with the current far-right Israeli government, some believe that the accords' expansion has frozen, at least for now. And three years on, the UAE is facing challenges in working with Israel's most extreme government ever.
Contending with Israel's political landscape
The UAE sees itself as a trendsetter in the region, with an independent foreign policy aimed at advancing its national interests.
And it did benefit from the accords, with 450,000 Israelis visiting the UAE between January 2021 and January 2023 and Israeli companies doing business in the Gulf country as well.
'To a substantial number of [Israeli] tourists … [the normalisation] was positive as it [allowed] non-dual citizens to explore new countries and shortened air travel when countries opened their airspace,' Mira al-Hussein, an Emirati sociologist and postdoctoral researcher at Oxford University, told Al Jazeera.
'For Israeli businessmen, too, the Gulf is a new market … For many Israelis unhappy with the economic woes of their country, the UAE became a destination for job seekers,' she added.
But dealing with an Israeli government made up of Bezalel Smotrich, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and other far-right hardliners who came to power last year is tough for Abu Dhabi.
'The coalition that the UAE signed the accords with are not the people or system the UAE is currently dealing with. This … disrupts any continuity and familiarity,' al-Hussein said.
Against the backdrop of increased Israeli violence against Palestinians under this government, the UAE has condemned Israel's violations of basic Palestinian rights.
For example, in April 2022, the UAE's minister of state for international cooperation, Reem bint Ibrahim al-Hashemy, summoned  the Israeli ambassador to Abu Dhabi to protest against Israel's violent incursions in Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa Mosque while emphasising 'the need to foster an appropriate environment that would allow a return to serious negotiations aimed at achieving a just and comprehensive peace and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state … in accordance with legitimate international resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative.'
And then, at the start of this year, Abu Dhabi 'called upon Israeli authorities to assume responsibility for reducing escalation and instability in the region' in the aftermath of Israel's raid on the Jenin refugee camp.

'Recently, the UAE has shown a greater willingness to criticise aspects of Israeli policy it opposes, including Israel's attacks on the city of Jenin, its plans to approve the construction of 10,000 new homes in the settlements, and inflammatory statements made by extremist figures like Ben-Gvir,' Elham Fakhro, a research fellow at Exeter University's Centre for Gulf Studies, told Al Jazeera.
Critics of the UAE have expressed doubts about whether this displeasure extends beyond statements, and is only for domestic consumption rather than any concern for the Palestinians. However, Fakhro said the UAE's willingness to criticise Israel reflects 'the UAE's growing confidence in its relationship with Israel, and possibly its aim to begin using the relationship to attempt to shape the direction of Israeli policy towards the Palestinians'.
No regrets
The basic calculation Abu Dhabi and Tel Aviv made in 2020 has not changed, and it seems that it is tied to them questioning Washington's long-term commitment to the Middle East.
'The strategic imperative toward greater regionalisation remains as America's leading role in security becomes more ambiguous,' Kristin Smith Diwan, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera.
'Both [the UAE and Israel] benefit as early movers in creating more open ties that strengthen their position through technology, defence, and economic cooperation.'

Ilan Zalayat, a Tel Aviv-based defence and political risk analyst, also assesses that Abu Dhabi does not regret normalisation thanks to the billions in bilateral trade, the boost to its tourism sector, and the strategic air defence systems it received because of the accords.
'The UAE knew what they were getting into, fully aware in 2020 that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict wasn't going anywhere, but they did assume that a certain status quo would be maintained,' Zalayat said.
'However, the talk of ministers from the far-right-wing Israeli government … about the 'erasure' of a Palestinian town or on … massive building in the West Bank, along with the visit of ministers to Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa compound, this is something Abu Dhabi cannot overlook,' he said, adding that Abu Dhabi's 'honeymoon' phase with Israel is effectively over, Zalayat feels.
Abu Dhabi's condemnation of Israel's behaviour is understandable given the UAE's domestic environment and public opinion across the wider Arab-Islamic world.
'The minority [of Emiratis] who cheered for normalisation are likely doing so as a patriotic duty. The overwhelming majority who silently oppose it choose to simply not legitimise it by engagement. The rapid and exaggerated accommodations made in the name of tolerance is perceived as distasteful to a largely conservative population,' al-Hussein said.
Although Israelis visit Dubai and Israeli businesses have set up in the UAE, the number of Emiratis vacationing in Israel or Emirati companies setting up there is minuscule in comparison.
'It doesn't seem that there are many Emiratis who are eager to … engage too much with Israel. But I think the Abu Dhabi leadership is still trying to sell this as something that is pragmatic and financially worthwhile for the Emirates,' said Courtney Freer, a fellow at Emory University.

The Saudi variable
Looking ahead, Israel's position in the Middle East will remain precarious if it cannot build on the accords and expand its cooperation with more countries in the region.
The biggest prize is Saudi Arabia, which has significant leverage over the future of the Abraham Accords.
Since 2020, Riyadh has been able to monitor how the accords played out. If it joins, which seems unlikely in the foreseeable future, that would likely facilitate other Arab-Islamic countries following suit.
The UAE itself now appears to be looking to Saudi Arabia to pick up the task of holding Israel to account.
On Wednesday, the UAE's ambassador to the United States, Yusuf al-Otaiba, said it was now up to other countries planning to normalise relations with Israel to stop the latter from its de facto annexation of the occupied West Bank.
'Our deal was based on a certain time period, and that time period is almost one, and so we have no ability to leverage the decisions that are made outside of the period that … the Abraham Accords was based on,' al-Otaiba said. 'I think it's up to … future countries if they are to take that particular approach, but there's very little that the UAE can do at this moment to shape what happens inside Israel.'
While some may dispute that characterisation of the UAE's ability - or desire - to influence Israeli policy, negotiations are believed to be ongoing between Saudi Arabia and Israel, with the US brokering.
The question now is, will the Saudis agree to a deal - and if they do, what concessions will they secure?
"The UAE's normalisation with Israel allowed Saudi Arabia to avoid many pitfalls and mistakes,' according to al-Hussein.
'Saudi Arabia is key, and this gives the kingdom considerable clout,' said Diwan.

After weeks of negotiations, Hamas on Friday released the first batch of captives it had agreed to set free under a   with Israel that came into effect in the morning.
Fighters took 237 people into captivity from Israel after Hamas's October 7 attack. Under the deal for a four-day truce, Hamas is to release 50 captives   for the release of 150 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel and a pause in fighting. However, more than those numbers might be released, officials indicated.
The deal was reached, and announced  , on Wednesday, while the truce officially started at 7:00am local time (5:00 GMT) on Friday.
Here is what we know about the captives released by Hamas and those who are still in Gaza.
How many captives were released on Friday?
In all, 25 captives were freed by Hamas on Friday. While initially, the plan was for Hamas to release 13 captives — women and children — it eventually also released 12 Thai captives in addition.
The Prime Minister of Thailand announced the release of the Thai nationals on X.
ได้รับการยืนยันจากฝ่ายความมั่นคงและกระทรวงต่างประเทศว่า มีตัวประกันชาวไทย 12 คนได้ถูกปล่อยตัวออกมาแล้วขณะนี้เจ้าหน้าที่สถานทูตกำลังไปรับตัวอีก 1 ชั่วโมงน่าจะทราบชื่อและรายละเอียดต่างๆครับกรุณาคอยติดตาม
- Srettha Thavisin (@Thavisin) November 24, 2023
All 25 captives were transferred by Hamas to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who crossed them over from Gaza into Egypt through the Rafah crossing.
The captives were handed over to Egyptian authorities.
At what time were they released?
The 12 Thai captives were released just before 4:00pm local time (14:00 GMT).
About half an hour later, the 13 other captives were released, Hamas officials told AFP.
On the Egyptian side of the border, the freed Israeli captives met representatives of the Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, according to the Israel Broadcasting Authority.
Medical staff, soldiers and helicopters are also waiting for them. The released captives will be taken in the helicopters tohospitals in Tel Aviv for medical and psychological assessments.
At the hospitals, captives will also reunite with their families, the Israeli army said earlier on Friday.
Which captives will be released?
The 12 Thai captives who were freed on Friday are among 23 who were captured by Palestinian fighters during their attack on southern Israel on October 7.
On Thursday, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office confirmed that it received an initial list of the 13 others to be freed and was in contact with their families.
 
Which captives will be released?
On Thursday, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office confirmed that it received an initial list of people to be freed and was in contact with their families.
However, relatives of the first group have not commented on the release. The Israeli government has reportedly warned them to not speak with the media and asked news outlets to not publish names accessed through any leaks.
Who might be released next?
The 13 captives who were originally to be released today are among the 50 that Hamas has committed to freeing over four days under the truce agreement.
But with the 12 Thai captives also being released, the total number of those whom Hamas frees during the truce is expected to exceed 50.
Three US citizens and eight French citizens are among those who could be freed in the later batches of released captives during the truce,according to officials from the two countries. The three American captives include two women and a three-year-old girl whose parents were killed in the initial Hamas attack.
Ghazi Hamad, member of Hamas's political bureau, told Al Jazeera that they are focused on releasing civilians for now. Hamad added that a comprehensive release of captives, including Israeli soldiers, would require an exchange with all 7,200 Palestinians who are imprisoned.
How many captives does Hamas have and who are they?
Palestinian fighters took 237 people into captivity during its  , according to Israel, although not all of them are currently with Hamas.
Other resistance groups in the Gaza Strip, such as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, are also holding some captives. The finalisation of the truce deal involved the agreement of all resistance brigades via phone call, said Hamas prior to the deal's announcement.
Hamas fighters abducted the captives during raids on an outdoor music festival, collective farms called kibbutzim, and military bases in Israel on  .
Not all captives are Israeli. At least half are foreign and dual nationals hailing from approximately 40 countries including the US, Thailand, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, Germany, Chile, Spain and Portugal, according to the Israeli government.
At least 33 captives are children, including preschoolers and a 10-month-old baby, according to Israel. They have also reported that others in the group include soldiers, the elderly, and people with disabilities.
Hamas has said that the captives are housed in "safe places and tunnels". Freed captives have reported sleeping on mattresses on floors of tunnels and being provided medical care.
Have any captives been released from Gaza?
Hamas has previously released four captives that were being held in Gaza.
The   of captives freed was an American mother-daughter duo on October 20, following Qatari meditation.
Three days later, two   were returned to Israel over 'humanitarian reasons and poor health grounds", following mediation led by Egypt and Qatar.
Israel's military has said that it   Ori Megidish, and   of another near al-Shifa Hospital. Hamas has said that Israeli air attacks have killed 50 captives in Gaza, including their army conscript, Noa Marciano, near the hospital.
On November 16, Israel's military also said it recovered the body of a   Yehudit Weiss, near al-Shifa.
On Tuesday, the PIJ said one elderly woman, Hanna Katzir, died in captivity owing to Israel "stalling" her release after the group offered to return her for humanitarian reasons. Israel has not responded to these claims.

Under Israeli attack: Who are the Christians of Gaza?

November 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
In one of the defining moments so far of Israel's ongoing war on Gaza, a deadly explosion at the al-Ahli Arab Hospital on October 17 killed close to 500 people.
Two days later,Israel bombed the  , the Gaza Strip's oldest, killing at least 18 people.
The deadly attacks on the hospital — an Anglican institution — and the church have brought into sharp focus the enclave's embattled Christian minority, which, like the rest of the Gaza Strip, is under assault from relentless Israeli bombardment.
The Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem described the attack on the church as a 'war crime'.

The Christian community was left reeling, yet most have not left the besieged city, which lays claim to a rich seam of Christian heritage going back two millennia.
So who are Gaza's Christians?
How many Christians live in Gaza and where did they come from?
The number of Christians in Gaza has dwindled in recent years. Today there are only approximately 1,000 left, a sharp drop from the 3,000 registered in 2007, when Hamas assumed complete control over the enclave.
According to Kamel Ayyad, a spokesperson for the Church of Saint Porphyrius, the majority of the population is from Gaza itself. The rest fled here after the creation of the state of Israel, which displaced about 700,000 Palestinians - an event they refer to as the Nakba, or "catastrophe".
Hamas rule brought an Israel-led land, air and sea blockade, accelerating the flight of Christians from the poverty-stricken enclave. 'It's become very difficult for people to live here,' says Ayyad. 'Many of the Christians left for the West Bank, for America, Canada or the Arab world, seeking better education and health.'
While most of Gaza's Christians belong to the Greek Orthodox faith, smaller numbers worship at the Catholic Holy Family Church and the Gaza Baptist Church. The former recently released a video of parish children praying , the din of bombs in the background.
There is a fluidity to the Christian community in Gaza, with many families comprising members of different denominations. Fadi Salfiti, whose family fled from Nablus to Gaza in 1948, attended all churches.
'On Sunday mornings, we would go to the Orthodox church, in the afternoons, we would go to the Catholic church, and at night we'd go to the Protestant church,' he said.

Salfiti was attending a youth conference in Madrid when Israel launched a   in 2008. To this day, he remains in Spain, where he now works as a management trainer. The attack on Saint Porphyrius killed his cousin's three children: Majd, 10; Juli, 12; and Suhail, 14.
How long have Christians lived in Gaza?
Gaza's Christian legacy stretches right back to the days when the faith was a persecuted sect promising salvation to the downtrodden.
In the Bible, after Jesus Christ's crucifixion, Philip the Apostle travelled down the desert road from Jerusalem to Gaza to spread the word. According to the scriptures, Philip was present at the wedding feast at Cana in Galilee, where Jesus turned water into wine.
The Church of Saint Porphyrius is the oldest in the enclave. It was originally founded in the 5th century after the death of the eponymous bishop who converted the city's pagans to Christianity, burning idols and temples. After the Persian conquest of the 7th century, the church was converted to a mosque. It was later rebuilt by the Crusaders in the 12th century.
Palestine's Christians, totalling 50,000 across the occupied territories, are sometimes referred to as 'living stones', a metaphor first invoked by Peter the Apostle, the ex-fisherman called upon to be a disciple of Jesus, to describe the role of believers in building the spiritual house of God. Today, the term harks to their special status as custodians of a faith born on their land.
How are relations between Christians and Muslims in Gaza?
Living under siege, Christians in Gaza attest to a spirit of solidarity that has united faiths in their struggle for survival and their dream of freedom.
'We are all Palestinians. We live in the same city, with the same suffering. We are all under siege and are all the same,' said Ayyad.
Generally speaking, the Christian community has always played an important role in Palestinian life, producing luminaries such as Issa El-Issa, founder of the highly influential Jaffa-based newspaper Falastin, a key driver of Palestinian Arab nationalism during the British Mandate, and Edward Said, who laid bare Western complacency towards the East in his seminal book, Orientalism.
In Gaza, too, members of the tiny community play an outsized role.
'They tend to be very educated, with a strong presence in business and in the voluntary sector,' says Salfiti.
The YMCA, for example, which offers sports, arts, educational and welfare activities for Palestinians in Gaza of all faiths, is Christian-run. Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, devastated by last month's Israeli air raid, which killed hundreds, is owned and operated by Anglicans.
Cut off from the world under the Israeli-led blockade, the community has at times felt vulnerable. In 2007, it was rocked by the murder of  , manager of the Teacher's Bookshop, a Baptist-run store in the strip that had also been firebombed months earlier. No group took responsibility for the murder, whichHamas condemned, saying they 'would not allow anyone to sabotage' Muslim-Christian relations.
But the killers were never brought to justice.

Overall, however, the communities are united in resisting their collective entrapment in what has been called the world's largest open-air prison.
Just as Muslims have been denied permits to visit Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, Christians have also been unable to visit sacred places like Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, revered as the birthplace of Jesus. Both communities are cut off from family members in the West Bank.
What is the current situation for Christians in Gaza?
Under the recent Israeli bombardments, Christians and Muslims alike sought refuge at Saint Porphyrius.
After the bombing, they all moved to the nearby Holy Family Church, located 400 metres away. About 560 people are now sheltering there, says Nisreen Anton, general project manager of the church.
Parish priest Gabriel Romanelli has been stranded in Bethlehem since the war started and remains in contact with his flock. In a message  recorded on October 24, he called for the bombing to stop and for a humanitarian corridor to be opened up.
'Please, let them know that the parish … is filled with ordinary people and Muslim neighbours. These are civilians who pose no danger to anyone,' he said.
As with many Palestinians in Gaza, Anton is determined to stay put. Huddled in the church with her three daughters, aged eight, nine and 12, she said the situation is getting worse every day.
'The Christians are suffering like any other Gaza people,' she said. 'This is our land and we will not leave. Can you imagine that someone called you and forced you and your family to go to another place?'
'We will stay.'

What have open source videos revealed about the Gaza hospital explosion?

October 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United Nations on Friday called for an independent international investigation into a   at a packed hospital in Gaza City earlier this week, as the   rages on.
Palestinian officials in the besieged Gaza Strip blamed an Israeli strike for the explosion at  , while the Israeli army said it was caused by an errant rocket fired by the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which denied the assertion. Israel's ally the United States has also put the blame on Palestinian fighters, while Arab states have blamed Israel.
The Palestinian health ministry said more than 470 people were killed in the explosion, while Israel said the number was deliberately inflated. US intelligence agencies assessed the number of victims to be between 100 and 300 people.
In the days leading up to the explosion, Israel ordered 1.1 million Palestinians in the north of Gaza to   ahead of a looming ground offensive. Israel's military specifically issued evacuation warnings to the al-Ahli Arab Hospital, according to the Anglican Church that runs the medical facility.
On Friday, a spokesperson for the UN's human rights office said staff were trying to collect evidence on the ground, but the heavy bombardment and the shortage of fuel amid Israel's "total siege" of the enclave were hampering efforts.
Meanwhile, several news organisations including Al Jazeera have   in recent days to piece together what happened. While Al Jazeera continues to gather information, here is what you need to know:
What happened?
The explosion took place at about 7pm local time (16:00 GMT) on Tuesday. Live footage from Al Jazeera showed a bright light rising in the sky and flashing twice before drastically changing direction and exploding.
A blast is then seen on the ground in the distance, followed by a second much larger explosion closer to the camera.
In the aftermath, footage and images from inside the hospital compound showed about two dozen destroyed vehicles in a car park. They were surrounded by damaged buildings with some of their windows blown out and blood on the walls and the ground.

- Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) October 19, 2023
What does the footage reveal?
An investigation by Al Jazeera's Sanad verification team found that Israeli statements seem to have misinterpreted the evidence to build a story that one of the flashes recorded by several sources was a rocket misfire.
Based on a detailed review of all videos, Sanad concluded that the flash Israel attributed to a misfire was in fact consistent with Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system intercepting a missile fired from the Gaza Strip and destroying it in midair.
Channel 4, which published a video analysis  examining the evidence presented by both sides, said there was 'no proof that the midair and ground explosions are necessarily linked'.
So far, there appears to be no conclusive evidence to determine who was behind the second blast, the one that hit al-Ahli hospital. A number of organisations have suggested that the relatively small crater left by the attack appears incompatible with weapons habitually launched by Israel.
However, the use of a different type of artillery cannot be ruled out.
The investigative journalism group Bellingcat identified  what appeared to be the impact crater after analysing footage and images of the aftermath. In a preliminary analysis, the group said the ground surrounding one side of the crater showed a cone of scarring and pitting, consistent with the explosion of a munition at this site.
Marc Garlasco, a military adviser at the PAX Protection of Civilians team, noted the impact point did not appear to be consistent with the 500, 1000 or 2000-pound bombs used in Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) used by Israel, according to the Bellingcat report.
Channel 4 journalists who visited the site in the aftermath of the incident also reported seeing small craters compatible with mortar strikes rather than missiles. Surrounding buildings only had superficial damage and no structural collapse.
The broadcaster said 'this makes a ground detonating Israeli missile strike unlikely, but it doesn't rule out an airburst munition which could cause major loss of life but would produce far less structural damage.'
Footage reviewed by the BBC , meanwhile, revealed inconsistencies in the reconstruction of events presented by Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari on Wednesday. 'The spokesman said it had been fired from a nearby cemetery – and there is a cemetery next to the hospital. But a map displayed by the spokesman showed a launch site further away. We have not been able to locate a cemetery there,' the British network said.
According to the broadcaster, an important part of missing evidence is missile fragments. Projectiles are often identifiable by the wreckage of their shell and can be used to determine the projectile's origin, but in this case, the evidence has yet to be found.
Is there other evidence?
Social media accounts on both sides have been scrutinised in the search for clues as accusations fly and tempers flare.
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad posted a message on Telegram at 7:09pm on the night of the explosion saying it had fired a barrage of rockets towards Israel – just minutes after the blast occurred.
In an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, Musab al-Breim, a spokesman for the group, said the timing of posts did not always indicate the timing of launches.
Posts on X sent by Hananya Naftali, a digital aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also aroused suspicion. 'Israeli Air Force struck a Hamas terrorist base inside a hospital in Gaza,' he wrote, but the post was almost immediately deleted.
By 10.58pm, Naftali apologised on X for sharing 'a Reuters report' that 'falsely stated Israel struck the hospital'. He said he had since deleted the tweet. 'As the [Israeli army] does not bomb hospitals, I assumed Israel was targeting one of the Hamas bases in Gaza,' he added.
The Israeli army also released a video with a recording of a conversation between purported Hamas officials, where they appear to talk about the misfired rocket that had caused the hospital blast.
In its analysis, Channel 4 said it had found the call's credibility questionable due to the syntax used, accent and tone of voice.
One journalist later asked Hagari at the press conference: 'I'd like you to address the question of credibility, because the [Israeli army] has a less than perfect track record with the issue of credibility'.
In his response, Hagari admitted previous shortcomings, but said that now was different.

'We want permanent ceasefire,' Palestinians in Gaza say as truce extended

Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip – Ayman Harb, a father of three children, stuck it out with his family in the   of Shujayea for more than a month of the war, even as Israeli bombs and tanks destroyed the besieged enclave's largest urban centre.
Last week, just before a four-day humanitarian pause came into effect, he decided the family had to flee. One of his sons has cerebral palsy and requires an oxygen tank, and the Israeli soldiers threatened to shoot Harb if he did not throw away the oxygen.
Now in central Gaza, Harb has but one dream — for the truce to turn into a full-fledged ceasefire that allows him and his family to return home.
On Monday evening as the four-day truce was coming to an end, Qatar, which has played a central role in mediating talks that enabled the pause in fighting, announced that the halt in the war had been extended by another two days.
For families across Gaza, that   also serves to underscore the suffering and humiliation of the enclave's 2.3 million people, who have been under attack since October 7. Palestinians are calling for a permanent ceasefire, stressing that their priority is to return to their homes even if they were destroyed in the heavy bombardment over the past month and a half.
The truce, which began on Friday, has seen the release of Israeli civilian captives held by Hamas in exchange for the release of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel.
It has quietened the skies over the Gaza Strip from the incessant sound of Israeli drones and warplanes. But it has done little to ease the collective trauma of the people of Gaza. According to the United Nations, 1.6 million people have been displaced from their homes, many forced to flee to the south of the strip. Some families who have tried to return to the north during the truce have been fired upon by Israeli snipers.
Others have been forced to live in what they describe as "shame".

"I've been here staying in a tent on the grounds of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital for a week, right next to the ambulances," 41-year-old Harb said. "We are about 20 people in one tent, but I had to send my wife and my other two children to stay with a relative after the rain soaked our tent this morning."
"Yes, the bombings have stopped, but we need a truce that will return us to our homes," he added. "Otherwise, there is no point in one. I'd rather go back to my home and die there than stay here in a tent living in shame and being forced to rely on people for the basic necessities of life."
Harb said his family had to beg before in their lives. Now they are desperate for medicine, food and water.
"We don't want war. We just want to live in our homes with our dignity intact," his 20-year-old cousin Badr said.
Imm Shadi al-Taher, a 63-year-old mother of 10, was displaced from her home in Tall az-Zaatar in Gaza City three weeks ago.

She has also been staying with 25 members of her family in one tent on the hospital grounds.
"We had our pride and dignity, but look at the state we are in now, this destitution and the fact that no one is looking to help us or is thinking of us," she said.
She acknowledged the   of not hearing the sound of drones, warplanes or artillery shelling, noting that her grandchildren are more relaxed, but she cannot bear to stay away from her home, which was destroyed.
"I'm willing to live in a tent but on the ruins of my home, where I don't need to ask anyone for help," she said. "I want to go back to bury my siblings who are still under the rubble of their own destroyed homes."
According to the Gaza media government office, at least 6,800 people are missing and presumed dead under the rubble. This is in addition to the 14,854 Palestinians killed since October 7, the majority of them women and children.

For Noor Saadeh, a 23-year-old mother of two who was displaced from her home in Gaza City a month ago, the truce is not enough.
"What's the point of a truce if we cannot go back to our homes?" she asked. "My son keeps telling me he misses his friends at nursery school. We want our old life back."
She is worried about the onset of winter since she and her family fled while it was still warm and have no way to go back to their home.
"I had to ask people for appropriate clothes for the children at the very least," she said. "We didn't think we would be here for this long."

'Nowhere safe to go': Confusion, fear after Israel's warning to evacuate

October 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Twenty-one-year-old Mohammed Elewa has barely gotten any sleep this past week in the Gaza Strip.
The sound of Israeli bombs and Palestinian ambulance sirens is a constant background noise as Israel pounds the Strip in revenge for a surprise attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7.
On Friday morning, he woke up to the news that the Israeli military had issued   for more than a million people in the northern Gaza Strip – nearly half of a total of 2.3 million residents.
The directive comes ahead of a feared ground invasion, but Elewa did not feel there was any point in leaving.
'There's nowhere safe to go. Where am I supposed to go?' asks Elewa on the phone from his home.
He is one of many in Gaza City who say they have to stay because they cannot make their way to the south.

'There was no space'
In a press statement, the Hamas leadership called the Israeli order 'psychological warfare'.
'The current developments in Gaza represent an extraordinarily audacious and brutal endeavour to forcibly remove the Palestinian people from their land,' said Izzat al-Risheq, a member of the Hamas political bureau.
Elewa ended up staying in Shujayea with some cousins and sisters, while others in his family went to the schools being used as shelters or to relatives in the south.
More than270,000 displaced people have sought refuge in 88 schools run by UNRWA, the UN agency providing assistance to Palestinian refugees, in the northern Gaza Strip.
But the overcrowding was such that, in some cases, "there were already 50 people to a room", the paracyclist, whose leg was amputated when he was injured in the Gaza border protests five years ago, said.
'I wanted to go with them [my family], but there was no space,' Elewa, said.
'[Now], they're asking everyone to leave, but there's literally nowhere to go. They're just telling us to go stand in the street,' he adds, a mix of panic and anger in his voice.
A loud explosion sounds on the other end of the call and the phone connection is cut.
At least 1,300 people were killed in the attack on Israel, while at least   including 583 children have been killed in Israel's bombardment of Gaza.

Death sentence for the vulnerable
The United Nations has called on Israel to rescind the evacuation order, saying the movement of people on that scale is 'impossible' without dire humanitarian consequences.
Thousands of people were seen heading south on vehicles and on foot on Friday, clutching their children and meagre belongings.
But many cannot leave – like the many patients in Gaza's overstretched hospitals.
'[It is impossible] to evacuate Al-Shifa hospital,' Dr Yusuf Abu al-Rish, Gaza's deputy health minister, said in a message to reporters, referring to the  , which is stretched well over its 500-bed capacity.
'All the other hospitals are full of injured patients,' Abu al-Rish added.
'Most cases are not stable enough to be transported,' he said. 'Even if there is a decision [to evacuate], it's not applicable at all.'
Tarik Jasarevic, spokesperson for the World Health Organization in Geneva, said it would be impossible to evacuate vulnerable hospital patients and such a move would be a death sentence for many.

'No one can speak'
'I saw a lot of people earlier today escaping on trucks, donkeys, cars,' 33-year-old journalist Mohammed Abu Safia said from Gaza City. 'I saw up to 10 people in one car.'
Abu Safia, who has already lost many members of his extended family in the past week, had come to Gaza City from Beit Lahiya in the far north of Gaza after the Israeli order.
He was sheltering in a church-run school with his young family of four.
'If you look at the people, you can see fear in their eyes, no one can speak,' said Abu Safia. 'If I try to interview someone, they start arguing with me. No one can think straight.'
'World leaders should speak up'
"I watched those videos [of people fleeing] today and I cried,' 36-year-old Wafaa al-Qudra told Al Jazeera.
'[Israel] knows we are in a state of war and there are no means of transport,' al-Qudra added, 'Are they just trying to humiliate people?"
'This order does not alter Israel's obligations in military operations to never target civilians and take all the measures it can to minimise harm to them,' said Clive Baldwin, senior legal adviser at Human Rights Watch.
'The roads are rubble, fuel is scarce, and the main hospital is in the evacuation zone," he added. "World leaders should speak up now before it is too late.'
'The south is being bombed,' al-Qudra said, explaining why she decided to not try to evacuate. 'My family lives there and they say the bombing didn't stop for a minute.'
Meanwhile, Elewa, the paracyclist, gets back in touch with news he has survived the earlier bombing and is preparing for another frightening night under Israeli bombardment.
'There's absolutely no sleep that's happening at all,' he says. 'Everyone's just on edge, just waiting.'

October 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
It was supposed to be impenetrable, the steep, 21-metre (70-foot) wall of sand dotted with heavily armed strongholds – attempting to breach it, a suicide mission.
Or so the Israelis thought.
They calculated that the Bar Lev Line, a 150km (93-mile) sand embankment that stretched from the Gulf of Suez to the Mediterranean Sea, would take 12 hours to pulverise with explosives - enough time to send reinforcements.
But when the Egyptians came on October 6, 1973, they pounded it down in just three hours, using water pumps.
'A few minutes after 1420 hours, as the canisters began to belch clouds of covering smoke, our first assault wave was paddling furiously across the canal, their strokes falling into the rhythm of their chant, 'Allahu AkbarAllahu Akbar',' wrote Lieutenant General Saad el-Shazly, an Egyptian military commander at that time, in his 1980 account of the events titled, The Crossing of the Suez.
'[Our] aircraft skimmed low over the canal, their shadows flicking across enemy lines as they headed deep into the Sinai,' el Shazly continued. 'For the fourth time in my career, we were at war with Israel.'
The attack was timed with another in the north, a battalion of Syrian forces that launched an assault to take back the Golan Heights.
Israeli forces were aghast.   was being observed in the Jewish state and Ramadan elsewhere in the Middle East, but that did not deter the start of Operation Badr.
Riding high on the victory of capturing territory four times its size in the  , Israel never anticipated an attack like this.
This first battle spiralled into the   known by several names: the October War, the Yom Kippur War, the Ramadan War, or the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.
Fifty years later, it is clear the war changed not just the region and the future of Arab-Israeli relations, but also the world, as it rocked the orbit of the Cold War, altering the US's approach to the Middle East.

'Egypt's finest hour'
Tewfick Aclimandos was just 14 years old when the war began but he has significant, if vague, recollections of it.
Neither a success nor a failure, it was still 'Egypt's finest hour', Aclimandos, director of the European studies unit at the Egyptian Center for Strategic Studies and professor at the University of Cairo, told Al Jazeera.
Taking back the Sinai Peninsula from Israel was a victory that cemented the Egyptian army's might under the leadership of  , he said. It gave legitimacy to every successor of Sadat's who took part in the war effort, he added.
'We are the founding fathers, we are the protectors of Egypt,' was the army's messaging after taking back the Sinai, Aclimandos recalled.
It is no wonder, then, that in the years following it, the anniversary of the war is celebrated widely, from free entry to military museums on October 6 to ceremonies and parades.
Just as focused as Cairo was on taking back Sinai, so too was Damascus on  . Israel had captured both in the 1967 war, alongside occupying  .
Conditions were ripe for the October War in the Arab mind: An Arab front heading into battle to avenge the suffering of Palestinians and to take back their own territories.
However, the events of the October War did not advance the Palestinian cause. According to Sami Hamdi, the managing director at International Interest, a political risk firm focusing on the Middle East, it was, in fact, 'a resounding failure' in that regard.
'Arab states restoring justice for Palestine was completely blown apart by the October War,' he told Al Jazeera.
While it was believed that the two most powerful armies in the region at the time would be able to push back against the Israeli occupation, the war instead ended with Egypt normalising relations with Israel, explained Hamdi.
Cairo and Damascus waged the war for their self-interests and the Palestinian cause was secondary, he argued.
Arab leadership in the region, as a result, was completely 'broken' by the events of the war, he said.

A united Arab front, splintered
The war demonstrated, however, that a united Arab front could be leveraged to spur action on the world stage.
When the tide of war turned in favour of Israel and fighting came to an impasse 12 days into the conflict, the Arab oil-producing countries, under the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), decided to reduce their oil production by 5 percent.
The states declared they would maintain the same rate of reduction each month until Israeli forces withdrew from Arab territories occupied in 1967, and the rights of Palestinians were restored. They also enforced an embargo on the US, suspending oil supply.
These actions had oil prices soaring - and affected the trajectory of the Cold War.
The Soviets had been supplying the Arab states with weapons, while the US backed Israel, but the embargo had the US scrambling for solutions to the conflict.
'This was also an opportunity to push away [the Soviets],' Yossi Mekelberg, an expert on Israel at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.
Thus, Henry Kissinger swooped in, the former US national security adviser shuttling from Cairo to Damascus, to Tel Aviv in an attempt to forge Arab-Israeli peace.
His 'shuttle diplomacy' - as his scuttling peacemaking was termed - worked, as it brought a ceasefire that would end the war, said Mekelberg.
Nimrod Goren, senior fellow for Israeli affairs at the Middle East Institute, agreed, saying the events were momentous in shifting the world from an era of war to an era of diplomacy,
'It was a watershed moment,' he told Al Jazeera.
But the Kissinger-fronted US diplomacy with individual countries was exactly what splintered a united Arab front, said Hamdi.
For example, Hamdi said, Kissinger probably told the Egyptians, 'I can convince the Israelis to give up Sinai'.
As such, he made a concerted effort to build relations based on individual interests that ultimately superseded pan-Arab ties, the analyst explained.
This would be reflected in the coming years, particularly in the  , said Hamdi, when Iraq invaded Kuwait and a US-led coalition, which included other Arab states, came to Kuwait's defence.

The trek towards Arab-Israeli peace
Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy eventually cut Egypt off from the Arab fold when Cairo normalised relations with Israel.
In the aftermath of the war, Sadat tried to break the deadlock of Arab-Israeli peace agreements, said Mekelberg.
In 1977, the former Egyptian president appeared in Jerusalem to give a speech on peace to the Israeli parliament, the first Arab leader to visit Israel.
That was followed by the signing of the   in 1979, at the behest of US President Jimmy Carter, who invited Sadat and then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to a retreat in Washington.
The accords were the basis for the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty – which shook Egypt loose from the Arab League fold.
'Egypt had sold out the Palestinians' was the common sentiment, said Hamdi.
Sadat's position, meanwhile, was that Egypt had done its best to fight two wars for the Palestinian cause and could not be expected to deliver justice alone, the analyst said.
The peace treaty, therefore, was to get Israel off its back, while its leaders and populace still harboured deep resentment towards the Israeli occupation, Hamdi explained.
Israel, for its part, was also invested in patching things up with Cairo - its biggest lesson from the war was the necessity of peace with its neighbours, said Goren.
The 1967 war had bloated Israel's confidence in its military might, and the recently formed state was convinced it was invincible, said Mekelberg. The October War changed that perception quickly.
There has been little success in Arab-Israeli peace in the 50 years since the war, however, the Israeli-Egypt peace treaty at least remains intact for the most part, Goren said.
For the Egyptian commander on the war's front lines, the war and its ensuing covenants were justified.
'One may be aggressive; one may have risked one's life for one's country. But why should that predispose one to gamble with the future of the armed forces and the fate of one's country?' el-Shazly wrote.

Is Israel violating the laws of war meant to protect children?

October 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Thousands of Palestinians   to already overwhelmed areas in the south of Gaza through unsafe conditions that could especially pose a risk to children, at least   of whom have already been killed in Israeli air strikes since Saturday.
"Moving from Gaza to Khan Younis is a long way, it's something that's very risky especially when you have kids with you and need to move very quickly, the roads are not very stable and there's a lot of bombardment on the way," Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed reported on Friday.
As some families in the northern part of the Gaza Strip make their way south with hopes of finding a safer place and basic necessities, here is a look at international laws that are meant to protect children.
What laws of war protect civilians and children?
The main pillars of protection for children during armed conflict are the Geneva Conventions.
The Geneva Conventions form   of international humanitarian law. Their four conventions were adopted over a series of treaties between 1864 and 1949.
The fourth Geneva Convention, adopted in 1949 in the aftermath of World War II, is centred on affording protection to civilians, including in occupied territories.
On July 6, 1951, the still newly formed state of Israel ratified the Geneva Conventions – one of 196 countries  to have done so.
How do the Geneva Conventions apply to Palestinian children?
Several articles and additional protocols, particularly in the fourth convention, afford protection to children during armed conflict.
These include:
Establishing hospitals and safety zones for children under the age of 15
Ensuring access to "essential foodstuffs, clothing and tonics" for children in areas that are under siege
Special care for children who are orphaned or separated from their families
Evacuating children to safe areas and reuniting them with their families
When children are evacuated, ensuring  that 'ministers of all religions, medical personnel, and medical equipment' are available where children are moved.
Articles and additional protocols generally concerning humanitarian relief and medical support also apply to the protection of children, according to Ka Lok Yip, assistant professor at the College of Law, Hamad Bin Khalifa University.
'The main source of protection for children in armed conflicts derives from the children's status as 'civilians' assuming that they are not taking a direct part in hostilities,' said Lok Yip.
So how is Israel faring on these different requirements of international law?
How are children affected by Israel's attacks on Gaza?
In addition to the hundreds of children who have been killed by Israeli air strikes, children in Gaza are also being deprived of food and medicine – in violation of the fourth Geneva Convention.
That is because Israel announced a "   of Gaza after the Hamas attack in southern Israel last Saturday, making clear that it would not allow food, medicines, fuel and other essential commodities into the coastal enclave.
'We barely have enough food to feed our children,' Zainab Matar, a mother of four,   on Tuesday. 'We can't keep our children warm at night because we lack proper clothing."
International organisations have been calling for the establishment of a humanitarian corridor, claiming that Gaza's medical facilities are at "  ". So far, Israel has refused to budge, and has bombed the Rafah crossing that connects the enclave to Egypt.
Power and generators that have stopped working are also putting newborns in incubators at risk, according to   from Fabrizio Carboni, the International Committee of the Red Cross regional director for the Near and Middle East.
Experts   that the widespread chaos children   is already going to have a grave and long-lasting effect on their psychological and emotional wellbeing.
What about education?
The fourth Geneva Convention says that children have a right to the protection of their cultural environment and their education.
Yet, already, Israel has bombed dozens of schools in the Gaza Strip, including several run by the United Nations, which were also serving as shelters where people moved after their houses and neighbourhoods were attacked in missile strikes.
In all, at least   have been damaged in Israeli bombing so far.
International law also requires occupying forces to ensure the education of those living under their control.
If Israeli forces launch a ground invasion into the Gaza Strip, as they have declared they will, it will be hard for them to live up to this requirement under law, since many schools and universities are now little more than bombed-out shells.
Who can prosecute violations of international law?
Courts such as the International Criminal Court at The Hague can launch an investigation to determine whether casualties in Palestine and Israel are in violation of international law. Activists   on the ICC to break its silence on Israeli aggression in Gaza.
The ICC has, in the past, begun investigations into potential war crimes committed by Israeli forces in Palestinian territories, but has not held anyone accountable to date.
Some countries also have domestic proposals from lawmakers that relate to making assistance to Israel contingent on its adherence to international laws.
Bill number HR 2407 or "Promoting Human Rights for Palestinian Children Living Under Israeli Military Occupation Act" was reintroduced to the US Congress in May.
It calls on banning Israel's government from using US tax dollars in the occupied West Bank for violations including 'the military detention, abuse, or ill-treatment of Palestinian children in Israeli military detention'.
Betty McCollum, a congresswomen behind the bill, said that the United States was providing billions to Israel's government each year – money that should not go towards actions that violate international law and cause harm but instead to 'Israel's security'.
What has happened to past violators of war laws?
Although the Geneva Conventions require violations to be punished, prosecutions have rarely occurred in the past for a variety of reasons, including that "the State officials themselves have been implicated, the accused persons are not within the jurisdiction of the States," or because of " other political sensitivity," said Lok Yip via email.
In the event of potential violations, investigations and prosecutions are handled by the ICC. In some cases, special courts may also be set up.
However, Israel, the United States, and Russia are among countries that do not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC.
In March, the   Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes in Ukraine, including the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia – a move that the Kremlin claimed was for the children's safety.
Since the   on member states for this, it has not been able to arrest Putin.

Filipino protesters slam gov't abstention on Israel-Gaza resolution at UN

October 31st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Manila, Philippines – Mohamed Amir woke up at around 6am to make the five-hour journey from his home in Pampanga province to the Philippines' capital, Manila.
Once there, the 20-year-old Filipino-Palestinian on Tuesday joined hundreds of others outside the Israeli embassy to protest against Israel's   on the besieged Gaza Strip.
In tears among the crowd, Amir shouted 'Free Palestine!' alongside Filipinos and the assortment of nationalities gathered in solidarity.
He was thinking of his family.
It had been four days since he last heard from his father, two grandparents and seven siblings, the youngest of whom is six years old. In mid-September, his family travelled from Dubai to Gaza to visit relatives. They were due to return on October 17, 10 days after the war began when Hamas, the group running Gaza, launched a surprise attack inside Israel.
'This issue is bigger than Hamas and Israel," a sobbing Amir told Al Jazeera. "They're eradicating our people," he said, referring to Israel. "They've caused so many deaths, so many children lost. I can't help but wonder if my siblings are among them now."
More than 8,300 Palestinians, including 3,457 children, have been killed in Israel's heavy bombardment of the Gaza Strip since October 7, according to health officials. In Israel, the death toll from Hamas's attack has topped 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities.

The protest in Metro Manila came days after the Philippines, the third-largest buyer of Israeli weapons, chose to abstain during a vote at the United Nations General Assembly on a   that called for an immediate humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas.
By doing so, the Philippines was the only Southeast Asian nation not to join the 120 countries that backed the non-binding resolution.
Liza Maza, secretary-general International League of Peoples' Struggle (ILPS), which spearheaded the protest, said Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's government's 'deafening silence on the massacre of a population in Israel-occupied Gaza is condemnable and smacks of inhumanity".
"The Marcos government has the blood of Palestinians on its hands. It turns a blind eye to the genocide in Gaza, while continuing to buy weapons from Israel," Maza added in her speech.
At the protest, demonstrators resisted a police blockade and an attempted dispersal. After fending off knocks from police shields, the activists ripped up Israeli flags.
Sol Iglesias, a professor at the University of the Philippines, told Al Jazeera that many Filipinos want their government "to be on the side of humanity, to protect civilians".
"An abstention is not a positive vote for a ceasefire," Iglesias said.
The pro-Palestinian crowd included Filipinos and foreigners [Michael Beltran/Al Jazeera]
The Department of Foreign Affairs explained that while the Philippine government stood for a humanitarian response in Gaza, it also wanted to include in the resolution a condemnation of Hamas's attack because three Filipinos were killed as a result of it.
Marcos Jr had earlier assured Israeli ambassador to the Philippines Ilan Fluss that his government stood firmly with Israel against Hamas.
At the UN Security Council meeting, Philippine ambassador Ariel Penaranda said, 'We condemn the killings, terrorist attacks, and other acts of violence by Hamas that took place in Israel on October 7 2023, and in this regard acknowledge the right of Israel to self-defence.'
Iglesias, who is also a member of the Scholars for Peace group, explained that in most geopolitical conflicts, the Philippines 'tends to take America's cue'.
Both the US and Israel have military agreements with the Philippines. The US expanded its joint sites of operation in the Philippines earlier this year.
Meanwhile, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, between 2018 and 2022 the Philippine government bought $275m worth of military equipment from Israel.

More children's deaths in Gaza in 3 weeks than annual total since 2019: NGO

October 29th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
More children have now been killed in Gaza in the last three weeks than the total killed in conflicts around the world in every year since 2019, the nongovernmental organisation Save the Children has said.
Figures released by the NGO on Sunday, referencing Palestinian health authorities, show that at least 3,324 children have been killed in Gaza since October 7, while 36 have died in the West Bank.
According to reports from the UN Secretary-General  on children and armed conflict, a total of 2,985 children were killed across 24 countries in 2022, 2,515 in 2021, and 2,674 in 2020 across 22 countries, Save the Children said.
'One child's death is one too many, but these are grave violations of epic proportions,' said Jason Lee, Save the Children's country director for the occupied Palestinian territory. 'A ceasefire is the only way to ensure their safety. The international community must put people before politics - every day spent debating is leaving children killed and injured. Children must be protected at all times, especially when they are seeking safety in schools and hospitals.'
The statement comes as Israel pushes forward with expanded ground operations inside Gaza as heavy aerial bombardment continues. On Friday, the entire Gaza Strip experienced a near-total communication blackout in what emerging accounts have described as a night of sheer   and some of the heaviest fighting since the war began.
A further 1,000 children have been reported missing  in Gaza and may be under the rubble. Children make up more than 40 percent of the more than 8,000 people confirmed to have been killed in Gaza. More than 6,000 children have been injured in Gaza since the war began.
Overall, at least 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals have also been killed in Israel, mostly in the surprise attack by Hamas on October 7.
Israel has imposed a total siege on the Gaza Strip, tightening the blockade enforced since 2007, cutting all supplies of food, electricity, fuel and water, and only allowing small amounts of aid in through the Rafah crossing with Egypt since October 21.
The lack of electricity as well as the scarcity of fuel to power generators has forced hospitals to   on their operations and the health ministry declared Gaza's health system in a state of '  ', further endangering the lives of children, including babies in need of energy-intensive neonatal intensive care.
Hospitals under threat
On Sunday, the Israeli military stepped up attacks close to al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, after ordering its 'immediate' evacuation.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) on Sunday said it has received 'serious threats' from Israeli forces to 'immediately evacuate' the al-Quds Hospital in the Tal al-Hawa area of Gaza City. Attacks in the vicinity of the hospital continued throughout the day.
Al Jazeera has spoken to the director of the hospital, who says there is no reason for Israel to be targeting the facility or the areas nearby.
'There's no police presence in the hospital, no military presence, nothing at all. Just thousands of Palestinians here, many of whom have lost their homes. Thousands of others are seeking shelter in UNRWA schools,' he said.
'Israel is targeting every single building around al-Quds Hospital. Why is that? Nobody knows.'
The PRCS has reported that the hospital is currently providing care to hundreds of injured patients. Around 12,000 displaced civilians, with a majority being children and women, have also sought refuge in the hospital building.
'We reiterate - it's impossible to evacuate hospitals full of patients without endangering their lives,' Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director of the World Health Organization (WHO), said on X.
Palestinians have   that killed nearly 500 people on October 17. Israel has denied being responsible.

Iran's Khamenei calls for boycott of Israel amid Gaza bombardment

November 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei has called on Muslim states to cease oil and food exports to Israel, demanding an end to the bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
"The bombings on Gaza must stop immediately … the path of oil and food exports to the Zionist regime should be stopped," Khamenei said in a speech on Wednesday, according to Iranian state media.
He suggested that the 'people of Gaza have mobilised the public's conscience by their patience," referring to the pro-Palestinian protests around the world.
"Look at what's happening in the world. In the UK, France, Italy, and the US, many people came out to the street and chanted slogans against Israel and the United States. They have lost their credibility and really, there is no remedy for them as they cannot justify Israel's attack," Khamenei said.
'The world of Islam shouldn't forget in the case of Gaza it was the US, France, and the UK that stood against the oppressed people of Gaza, it wasn't just the Zionist regime.'
Thousands of dead
Israel has promised to wipe out Tehran-backed Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza, following an October 7 attack that Israel says killed 1,405 people and saw hundreds taken as captives.
Israel has launched an unprecedented bombardment of Gaza and imposed a siege on the enclave. Palestinian authorities say almost 8,800 people have been killed.
Iran's clerical rulers have warned Israel of an escalation if does not end aggression against Palestinians, indicating that Tehran-backed proxies in the region are ready to act.
Iran's top diplomat Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Tuesday that "it is natural that the resistance groups and movements do not remain silent against all these crimes" committed by Israel.
"They will not wait for anyone's advice, therefore we need to use the last political opportunities to stop the war," he continued, warning the situation could "get out of control".
That statement came hours after Tehran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for a drone attack on southern Israel, with the group promising to continue its attacks.
The same day, the Israeli military said its forces intercepted a "surface-to-surface missile" fired towards Israeli territory from the area of the Red Sea, saying it was "successfully intercepted" by the Arrow aerial defence system.

The United Nations human rights office has said Israel's complete siege of Gaza, combined with the evacuation order, could amount to a forcible transfer of civilians, breaching international law.
Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said in Geneva on Tuesday that Israel has yet to make any effort to ensure those evacuated were provided with proper accommodation and satisfactory conditions.
'We are concerned that this order, combined with the imposition of a complete siege of Gaza, may not be considered as lawful temporary evacuation and would therefore amount to a forcible transfer of civilians in breach of international law,' she said.
The forced relocation of civilians is classed as a crime against humanity and is punishable by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
'Those who managed to comply with the Israeli authorities' order to evacuate are now trapped in the south of the Gaza Strip, with scant shelter, fast-depleting food supplies, little or no access to clean water, sanitation, medicine and other basic needs,' Shamdasani said.
On October 12, Israel ordered 1.1 million people in the north of Gaza to evacuate and move south of the enclave.
Shamdasani's comments come as Israel prepares for a ground offensive in Gaza to retaliate for the October 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza.
So far, at least 2,800 Palestinians have been killed, and about 11,000 have been injured since Israeli air raids began. The Israeli military said some 1,400 people have been killed in Israel since October 7.
The World Food Programme (WFP) said in separate comments that its food supplies in the besieged enclave were running low, but it was stockpiling supplies in the Egyptian city of El Arish.
WFP's regional communication lead for the Middle East and North Africa, Abeera Etefa, said the UN body hoped the aid trucks 'to cross as soon as the border access is granted'.
'We call for unimpeded access, safe passage to desperately needed humanitarian supplies to Gaza,' she said.

Crucial food and aid trucks have been heading to the Rafah crossing on the Egypt border, but it remains uncertain whether the supplies can cross into southern Gaza.
On Tuesday, the World Health Organization also said it needs urgent access to Gaza to deliver aid and medical supplies as it warned of a long-term humanitarian crisis.
According to the UN Palestinian agency, UNRWA, fuel reserves at all hospitals across Gaza are expected to last for only 24 hours.
'The shutdown of backup generators would place the lives of thousands of patients at serious risk,' it said.

'World is watching': Fears grow of a massive Gaza invasion by Israel

Fears of a massive ground invasion of Gaza reverberated throughout the Middle East as Israel plotted its response to the worst attack it suffered in decades.
Hamas gunmen rampaged through Israeli towns and killed at least 250 people on Saturday while retreating with soldier-and-civilian hostages in the deadliest day of violence for Israel since the Yom Kippur war 50 years ago.
More than 230 Gazans were also killed when Israel responded with devastating retaliatory strikes.
The Israeli military was still engaged in fighting with Hamas in some parts of southern Israel as of 1:30am (10:30 GMT), and the situation in the country was not totally under control.
"We will take mighty vengeance for this black day," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier.
"Hamas launched a cruel and wicked war. We will win this war but the price is too heavy to bear. Hamas wants to murder us all. This is an enemy that murders mothers and children in their homes, in their beds. An enemy that abducts elderly, children, teenage girls."
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said the assault that began in Gaza would spread to the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.
"This was the morning of defeat and humiliation upon our enemy, its soldiers and its settlers," Haniyeh said in a speech. "What happened reveals the greatness of our preparation. What happened today reveals the weakness of the enemy."
'Kill and capture'
Late on Saturday in southern Israel, residents had yet to be given the all-clear to leave shelters where they hid from the assailants since the early hours.
In Gaza, black smoke and orange flames billowed into the evening sky from a high-rise tower hit by an Israeli air strike. Crowds of mourners carried the bodies of fighters wrapped in green Hamas flags through the streets.
Gaza's dead and wounded were carried into crumbling and overcrowded hospitals with severe shortages of medical supplies and equipment. The health ministry said 232 people had been killed and at least 1,700 wounded.
Saleh al-Arouri, deputy chief of Hamas's political bureau, told Al Jazeera that Hamas was holding  , including senior military officials. He said Hamas had enough captives to make Israel free all Palestinians in its jails.
'We managed to kill and capture many Israeli soldiers," he said.
While world leaders called for restraint, many observers predicted a major ground assault on Gaza is likely in the works.
'There's going to be a second act and that is an invasion of Gaza, and I think larger than 2014 when Israel called up 80,000 reserves," said Yonah Jeremy Bob, a military analyst for the Jerusalem Post.
"Within a day or two, Israeli will have a massive force that will be able to overwhelm Hamas forces in Gaza,' Bob told Al Jazeera.
'World is watching'
US President Joe Biden decried the "unconscionable" assault by Hamas fighters and pledged to ensure Israel has "what it needs to defend itself". He told Netanyahu the US "stands with the people of Israel".
"Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop. There's never a justification for terrorist attacks and my administration's support for Israeli's security is rock solid and unwavering," said Biden.
The president also warned Israeli's enemies "this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching".
Egypt is in talks with Saudi Arabia and Jordan in a bid to defuse Palestinian-Israeli tensions, the Egyptian foreign ministry said.
Across the Middle East, there were demonstrations in support of Hamas with Israeli and American flags set on fire and marchers waving Palestinian flags in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.
In Iran, Israel's regional archenemy, members of parliament opened their session on Saturday by chanting "Death to Israel" and "Israel will be doomed, Palestine will be the conqueror."
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said "today's operation created a new page in the field of resistance and armed operation against occupiers".
In Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camps, hundreds took to the streets to celebrate the Hamas operation.
'Do whatever it takes'
Danny Danon, a member of Israel's Knesset, said a response against Hamas is coming.
"The people in Gaza will have to take into consideration they will have to pay a price. Unlike Hamas, we have no intention of hurting civilians, but when we hunt Hamas we will be strong, we will be efficient, and we will do whatever it takes to hunt them down," Danon told Al Jazeera.
"We will not sit idly by after more than 200 Israeli civilians were butchered, massacred today on our Jewish holiday."
Ali Abunimah, co-founder of The Electronic Intifada website, said 80 years of repression and "massacres" by Israel in Palestine was the reason behind the violence carried out on Saturday.
"The Palestinian people are struggling justly for their liberation. An Indigenous people fighting for their existence will fight back with great motivation to decades of living under the boot of this colonial regime whose brutality is being highlighted by the response from Israeli leaders," he told Al Jazeera.

Israel's attacks on hospitals 'should be investigated as war crimes': HRW

Israel's repeated attacks on  , health personnel and ambulances in Gaza should be 'investigated aswar crimes', international NGO Human Rights Watch has said.
The Israeli military's 'apparently unlawful attacks' are further destroying Gaza's healthcare system at a time when medics have unprecedented numbers of severely injured patients, and hospitals have run out of medicine and basic equipment, the group said on Tuesday.
'Despite the Israeli military's claims on November 5, 2023, of 'Hamas's cynical use of hospitals', no evidence put forward would justify depriving hospitals and ambulances of their protected status under  ,' HRW added.
A war crime is a serious violation of international humanitarian law, committed with criminal intent. HRW urged the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate Israel's actions.
Healthcare system 'devastated'
As of November 10, two-thirds of primary healthcare facilities and half of all hospitals in Gaza are not functioning, according to the United Nations. And as of November 12, at least 521 people, including 16 medical workers, have been killed in 137 'attacks on health care' in Gaza, the World Health Organization said.
'Israel's repeated attacks damaging hospitals and harming healthcare workers, already hard hit by an unlawful blockade, have devastated Gaza's healthcare infrastructure,' said A Kayum Ahmed, special adviser on the right to health at HRW. 'The strikes on hospitals have killed hundreds of people and put many patients at grave risk because they're unable to receive proper medical care.'
Between October 7 and November 7, HRW said it investigated attacks on or near five healthcare facilities in Gaza.
It found that Israeli forces struck the Indonesian Hospital multiple times between October 7 and 28, killing at least two civilians; the International Eye Hospital was struck repeatedly and completely destroyed on October 10 or 11; the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital was forced to close on November 1, days after air raids on or near the facility; a man and a child were injured after repeated attacks on the al-Quds Hospital; and Israeli forces struck well-marked ambulances on several occasions – at least a dozen people were killed or wounded in one incident outside al-Shifa Hospital on November 3.
'These ongoing attacks are not isolated. Israeli forces have also carried out scores of strikes damaging several otherhospitalsacross Gaza,' HRW said.
(Al Jazeera)
'Special protections'
'Intentionally directing attacks against medical units and transport' is prohibited as a war crime under the ICC's Rome Statute, HRW noted.
'Hospitals and other medical facilities are civilian objects that have special protections under international humanitarian law, or the laws of war. Hospitals only lose their protection from attack if they are being used to commit 'acts harmful to the enemy', and after a required warning,' it said.
Israel claims that Hamas fighters have set up command centres beneath hospitals like al-Shifa and the Indonesian Hospital - claims Hamas and the hospital staff deny.
'These claims are contested,' HRW said. 'Human Rights Watch has not been able to corroborate them, nor seen any information that would justify attacks on Gaza hospitals.'
HRW also criticised the 'sweeping nature' of Israel's evacuation orders, which did not take into account specific requirements for hospitals and patients. The group said there was no way to ensure safe compliance as 'there is no reliably secure way to flee or safe place to go in Gaza', which raised concerns that 'the purpose was not to protect civilians, but to terrify them into leaving'.
'The Israeli government should immediately end unlawful attacks on hospitals, ambulances, and other civilian objects, as well as its total blockade of the Gaza Strip, which amounts to the war crime of collective punishment,' HRW said.
It added that Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups should also take feasible precautions to protect civilians under their control.

'Scream to the world, stop genocide': Indonesian medics rally for Gaza

Medan, Indonesia – Indonesian medics have held a communal prayer event in Jakarta to call for a ceasefire and an end to the 'genocide' in Gaza where the Indonesia Hospital, located in the north of the war-torn Palestinian enclave, has been forced to cease operations.
The event held in Jakarta and online included staff from Indonesia's doctors', midwives', pharmacists' and dentists' associations, and was organised by the Medical Emergency Rescue Committee (MER-C) which helped fund the construction of the  .
It is 'time to scream to the world, stop genocide', the Indonesian Medical Association and MER-C said in a joint statement.
'Attacks on hospitals and healthcare workers constitute violations of international law,' they said in the statement.
'A total of 22 hospitals and 49 health centres were forced to stop operating in the Gaza Strip due to Israeli arrogance,' the two groups said, calling on Indonesia's government to 'engage in firm diplomacy on the international stage to pressure Israel to cease its aggression in Gaza'.
Three Indonesian volunteers, Fikri Rofiul Haq, Reza Aldilla Kurniawan and Farid Zanjabil Al Ayubi, are currently based at the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza's Beit Lahia.
The hospital's director, Atef al-Kahlout, told Al Jazeera on Thursday that the medical facility was no longer able to "offer any more services … we cannot offer patients any beds".
Severe Israeli attacks were reported in the vicinity of the Indonesian Hospital on Friday. Describing the bombing, journalist Hussam Shabbat said from   'We lived 15 minutes of hell.'
Shabbat said that while Israel has bombed the area daily, Friday was the most difficult day since the war began.
Dr Zecky Eko Triwahyudi, an orthopaedics and traumatology doctor at the Jakarta Cempaka Putih Islamic Hospital, who attended the prayer event in the Indonesian capital, said it was 'the least he could do' to support the people of Gaza.
'Health facilities, which should not be targeted, have been targeted by Israeli forces for the past month. Without any basis, excuses are made up as justification for attacking hospitals and health workers. All hospitals in the Gaza Strip have become targets,' he said.
Triwahyudi said that a humanitarian response was a matter of urgency as the two largest and best-known trauma hospitals in the Gaza Strip, al-Shifa Hospital and the Indonesian Hospital, 'have been paralysed in the last few days'.
The Indonesian Hospital is the main trauma hospital in northern Gaza, and thus offers essential care in that area, while al-Shifa Hospital is located in central Gaza, he said.
'Indonesia's response could be more robust'
While Indonesian health workers have rallied behind the Indonesian Hospital and the plight of Gaza, Indonesia's government faces a challenging diplomatic situation regarding the war, and the fate of the hospital and its staff, as Jakarta moves closer to the United States - Israel's staunchest ally.
Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim country and has seen large demonstrations in support of Palestinians as well as calls for a  seen as linked to Israel.
During a meeting earlier this week,   to do more to end 'atrocities' in Gaza and help bring about a ceasefire. The two then agreed to elevate diplomatic relations to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership'.
Ahmad Rizky M Umar, an associate lecturer at the University of Queensland, told Al Jazeera that while Indonesia built and facilitates the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza, it is unable to protect it now.
'Indonesia does not have sufficient diplomatic capacity to defend it, especially from attacks by' Israeli forces, he said. 'Indonesia's response could be more robust by convincing other countries to put pressure on Israel. Especially, to encourage a ceasefire and stronger humanitarian response,' he said.
Dr Yogi Prabowo, also an orthopaedic and traumatology doctor at the Jakarta Cempaka Putih Islamic Hospital, said the Indonesian Hospital's cessation of operations will likely have fatal consequences for Palestinians, particularly after al-Shifa also stopped providing services.
'The Indonesian Hospital was the last breath of medical services in Gaza, but now it has stopped,' Prabowo said.

Elon Musk in Israel to discuss Starlink, anti-Semitism

Tech billionaire Elon Musk has arrived in Israel to kick off a high-profile trip to the country amid the ongoing truce with Palestinian group Hamas.
Musk's plane touched down in Tel Aviv on Monday morning, said Israeli aviation expert Avi Scharf, citing an aviation tracker. The billionaire is expected to meet with officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog, as well as relatives of Hamas-held captives, Israeli media reported .
The trip comes on the fourth day of an ongoing truce between Israel and Hamas, during which Israel is recovering dozens of captives in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
It also comes amid concern about misinformation and hate speech on Musk's social media platform X, seven weeks into the Gaza war, and speculation over how his satellite internet network   could boost connectivity in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
Agreement on Starlink
As Musk arrived, Israel announced it had struck an agreement "in principle" to use SpaceX's Starlink communications channel in Gaza.
The agreement marked a major shift for Israel, whose communication minister previously dismissed the idea of opening up Starlink to Gaza because it said Hamas would use it for "terrorist activities".
But on Monday, Israeli Communication Minister Shlomo Karhi announced Israel had reached an agreement in principle under which "Starlink satellite units can only be operated in Israel with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications, including the Gaza Strip".
In an X post addressed to Musk, Karhi said he hoped the entrepreneur's visit to Israel "will serve as a springboard for future endeavors, as well as enhance your relationship with the Jewish people and values we share with the entire world".
Elon Musk, I congratulate you for reaching a principle understanding with the Ministry of Communications under my leadership.
As a result of this significant agreement, Starlink satellite units can only be operated in Israel with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of
- שלמה קרעי - Shlomo Karhi (@shlomo_karhi) November 27, 2023
'Combat anti-Semitism'
Musk, who has been criticised for failing to curb hate speech on X, was due to meet with Israeli President Herzog and families of Hamas-held captives. Herzog said he would 'emphasise the need to act to combat rising anti-Semitism online'.
Musk is also set to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu, who expressed similar concerns to the tech entrepreneur during their last meeting in September.
Musk said at the time that he opposed anti-Semitism and stood against anything that "promotes hate and conflict."
Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia have risen in the United States and worldwide, including during the now seven-week-old war between Israel and Hamas in the besieged Gaza Strip.
X has been a key source of information and debate about the Gaza war, with government officials, as well as pro-Israel and pro-Palestine users, sharing content. However, critics say it has also amplified misinformation, conspiracy theories, and hateful content, including anti-Semitism, during the conflict.
Musk has himself been accused of playing a role in spreading such content.
On November 15, he agreed with a post on X that falsely claimed Jewish people were stoking hatred against white people, saying the user who referenced the "great replacement" conspiracy theory was speaking "the actual truth'.
The White House   what it called an "abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate" that "runs against our core values as Americans'.
Major US companies including Walt Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and NBCUniversal parent Comcast paused their advertisements on his social media site.

What is a 'human shield' and why is Israel using the term in Gaza?

November 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Rights organisations have accused Israel of war crimes as an overwhelming majority of the 11,100 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks are civilians, two-thirds of them women and children.
In its defence, the Israeli army has accused the Palestinian resistance group Hamas, which has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, of using civilians as human shields. The Palestinian armed group has rejected the allegations.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told US President Joe Biden last month that Hamas was hiding behind civilians. Human shields were 'a key pillar of Hamas's terror operations", The Times of Israel quoted Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari as saying on Sunday. Israel has, however, not provided concrete proof for its allegations.
The Israeli army has used this argument to issue   to the entire northern part of Gaza as well as protected facilities including  , Gaza's largest medical facility, and to cast them as legitimate targets. Hamas has reiterated it has  .
We asked legal experts what this term means and what its implications are for the 2.3 million people living in Gaza.
What are human shields?
Under international law, the term refers to civilians or other protected persons whose presence is used to render military targets immune from military operations.
The use of human shields is forbidden by Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions and is considered a war crime as well as a violation of humanitarian law.
There are three kinds of human shields: Voluntary shields are people who willfully choose to stand in front of a legitimate target as a means of protection; Involuntary shields are people who are coercively deployed as bargaining chips or as a means to thwart an attack; and proximate shields are civilians or civilian sites that become shields or are cast as shields due to their proximity to the fighting.
After Israel instructed 1.1 million Palestinians in northern Gaza to move south, the family of Al Jazeera correspondent Youmna ElSayed received a   from the Israeli army warning them to immediately leave their home in Gaza City. They decided it was too risky to make the journey south amid the heavy bombardment.
Neve Gordon, co-author of Human Shields: A History of People in the Line of Fire, told Al Jazeera that evacuation orders give the warring party that issued it - in this case Israel - the ability to cast families like ElSayed's and the entire population of northern Gaza as proximate human shields.
'Temporally, proximate shielding can endure far longer than either voluntary or involuntary shielding, because the latter two are restricted to the time during which the civilian acts or is forced into acting as a shield,' Gordon said. By contrast, proximate shields exist as long as the fighting continues.
Israel also claimed that Hamas prevented civilians from leaving northern Gaza, using them as involuntary shields, and that others had willfully stayed behind and would therefore be considered 'an accomplice in a terrorist organisation", according to mobile phone audio messages and air-dropped leaflets. Israel provided no proof that Hamas forced people to stay.
What are the implications of labelling civilians as human shields?
This label can be used by a warring party to 'relax the repertoire of violence that is permitted to be used in that area', said Gordon, who teaches international law at Queen Mary University of London.
The presence of human shields does not render a site immune from attack. While they are protected people according to the laws of war, the military assets they shield can still be legitimately targeted.
If they die, the responsibility for their death is placed on those who use them as human shields, rather than on those who kill them. Therefore, 'in an area where there are only human shields and combatants, more lethal violence can be used', Gordon said.
The limits are drawn by the principles of distinction and proportionality: An army has the duty to target only the enemy, even if this means facing greater risks to minimise civilian casualties; and to weigh the military value of each attack against the civilian casualties that are likely to result from it.
Non-combatant civilians even if used as human shields are entitled to protection, experts say.
Marc Weller, chair of international law and international constitutional studies at the University of Cambridge, said that if 1,000 people were sheltering at a site that was proven to hide a Hamas presence, Israel would have to send soldiers in to only hit the enemy assets (principle of distinction). If it instead opted to bomb the compound from the air, it must be able to prove the existence of enemy assets and to argue that the 'incidental' loss of life was proportionate to the military advantage gained (principle of proportionality).
Issuing an evacuation order to 1.1 million people and then considering an entire population as a legitimate target also contravenes the same principles. 'Knocking on a building [to ask its residents to evacuate] may be reasonable, but telling a million people that they all have to get out because you are bombing everything is unreasonable,' the Cambridge professor told Al Jazeera.
'Israel cannot discharge its obligation of distinction by wishing the civilians away. This places the burden of protection on victims, rather than attackers.'
Can Israel legally strike a hospital if it is used to shield a military target?
Hospitals are protected under humanitarian law, but this status can be lost if their premises are used for military purposes.
'The law says hospitals are protected but immediately adds a series of exceptions where it is allowed to bomb hospitals,' Gordon said. 'Israel knows what these exceptions are and frames the hospital as being a site where those exceptions apply.'
Gordon and co-author Nicola Perugini coined the phrase 'medical lawfare' to describe 'the idea of framing hospitals as carrying out a mission that is outside their humanitarian duty to justify strikes against them'.
This is a strategy 'repeatedly deployed by the Israeli military and government to legitimise attacks on life-sustaining and saving infrastructure and shift the blame onto the Palestinians themselves,' Gordon said.
In the case of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Israel said it presented evidence in recent weeks that Hamas's main command centre is located underneath the building, home to at least 5,000 patients and thousands more refugees.
Ezzat el-Reshiq, a Hamas official,   that the group was using the facility as a shield for its underground military. International observers including Norwegian doctor Mads Gilbert, who worked at the facility for 16 years, said they never encountered any indication of any military activity beneath the facility.
Weller, the Cambridge professor, noted that even if military activity were to be proven and the site therefore became liable to attack, patients and staff must be given the opportunity to evacuate.
'Once more, it doesn't mean that all the civilians in it are removed from the protection of humanitarian law more generally. There would still have to be a calculation of proportionality in terms of civilian damage and military gain,' Weller said.
'The very fact that we have seen 44 [Israeli] soldiers killed in this conflict and almost 11,000 [Palestinian] civilians gives an indication that the calculation of proportionality in Gaza has left the bounds of reasonableness.'

October 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
When Asmaa al-Daher, a pharmacist and aid worker based in Turkey, went home to Gaza for a visit just over two weeks ago, she had little idea that one of the most brutal military campaigns her besieged home had ever faced was about to begin.
Although she was already experienced in providing humanitarian relief to victims of war through her work in Syria with Al-Ameen for Humanitarian Support, al-Daher was not prepared for what was to come in Gaza. The ongoing Israeli bombardment is like nothing many aid workers say they have ever seen.
'I have witnessed many wars during my life, but I have never witnessed anything like this,' the 27-year-old said in a voice message she recorded and sent to a colleague in Turkey by WhatsApp.
After being displaced five times inside Gaza within a couple of weeks, al-Daher is now in Rafah on the southern border with Egypt. In her five-minute WhatsApp recording, she tried to explain to Yasser al-Tarraf the reality she is living.
In a trembling voice and hurrying to get the words out before the internet failed, she said: 'These are the worst days for the Palestinian people – genocide and massacres in all neighbourhoods.'
Al-Tarraf told Al Jazeera that while al-Daher was in Gaza only by chance, she has been working around the clock to help coordinate with local authorities on the ground to get resources and aid where they are needed most. He said he knows she understands well what the people of Gaza are going through.
'Our wound is one. We have witnessed displacement and killing in Syria, so our sympathy with Gaza is great."
Al-Ameen, a Syrian organisation, has been working in the Gaza Strip for the past two years, providing humanitarian support, as well as vocational training. Since the bombing began two weeks ago, it has focused on helping to distribute food and resources.
A matter of life or death for the besieged
Al-Ameen is not the only Syrian aid organisation to have begun providing relief to victims of disasters in other countries, for instance, in Morocco to assist earthquake victims or the Libyan victims of flash floods.
During the years of war in Syria, dozens of volunteer organisations and aid teams emerged, driven by a desire to provide assistance to those in need. These relief efforts have quickly become highly professional operations through years of experience in dealing with the aftermath of bombing campaigns, displacements and repeated sieges that different Syrian areas have undergone. And recently, many of these organisations began operating in Gaza.
The Emergency Response Team, for example, is a humanitarian aid organisation working in northwestern Syria. Its head of operations, Dulama Ali, told Al Jazeera that because the region is largely outside of the control of the Syrian regime, it allows them some flexibility to respond outside the country. 'We are trying to provide assistance to any country that needs it,' he said, adding that his team has been able to work in Lebanon, Libya and Morocco, and has been operating in Palestine since 2021.
Despite the unquestioned skills that humanitarian workers from Syria have, the situation they have found in Gaza presents daunting challenges, al-Tarraf said.
Until Friday, the Gaza Strip had languished under a total blockade for nearly two weeks – no food, water or medical resources were allowed in by Israel.
On Saturday,   carrying food and medical aid was allowed to cross into Gaza via the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border following the   of two American hostages by Hamas. Only 20 of the some 200 relief trucks which had assembled at the Rafah crossing were allowed to pass through, however.
The prolonged siege was unprecedented even for seasoned humanitarian aid workers used to operating in war zones, said al-Tarraf. 'Closing the crossings was a turning point in the response because it means life or death for the besieged.'
He noted that relief organisations were unable to bring any aid into the Gaza Strip during the siege, so they relied on buying food supplies that were already within Gaza and redistributing them to those in need.
Intense bombing has also destroyed many warehouses holding provisions, and aid workers say they have only about half what they had to distribute before the siege began. Continuous displacement of citizens in Gaza has also made it extremely difficult to bring provisions to those in need as aid workers simply cannot reach them.
Some aid workers have lost their lives. Muhammad Qahwaji, a photographer who worked with Al-Ameen, was killed during the first days of the Israeli bombing. Al-Tarraf heard about his passing only recently and still does not know where Qahwaji died. Another Al-Ameen photographer Hassan al-Aswad was later injured after his family's home was destroyed by a rocket.
'Pray for us before we go'
Before relief workers in Gaza head off to perform their duties, they message their colleagues outside the Gaza Strip via WhatsApp or other messaging services. They ask them to pray for them as they bid farewell.
Molham Volunteering Team is another organisation which provides relief to Syrian victims of war but is now also trying to provide aid in Gaza. 'There is no safe place within Gaza. We are cooperating with four organisations inside. All of them are in danger. And when they go out to perform their duties, they do not know if they will return or not,' Abdullah al-Khatib, head of media and fundraising, told Al Jazeera.
At least 4,651 peoplehave been killed in the Gaza Strip during the ongoing Israeli military campaign, according to the latest statistics from the Palestinian Ministry of Health, nearly 70 percent of these victims were minors, women and the elderly. More than 14,000 people have also been injured.
Many aid organisations have diverted resources from their operations in Syria, despite low funding and humanitarian needs being at their highest levels in years.
'Since the beginning of our work [in Syria] in 2012, the Palestinians were among the first donors to Syria,' said al-Khatib. 'There are entire housing projects funded by Palestinians in northwestern Syria.'
Like other Syrian aid operations, the Molham Team relies on private donations and all donations received for Syria can only be used for aid provided within Syria. Therefore, it has established a separate fund-raising arm for providing relief in Gaza.
'We have made our donation platforms available to everyone who wants to support Palestine – that is our duty,' said al-Khatib.

Fighting intensifies in Lebanon's Ein el-Hilweh camp despite truce talks

At least 10 people have been killed and dozens wounded in   between rival groups in a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon, as stray bullets and shells hit residential areas in the country's third-largest city Sidon.
The Ein el-Hilweh camp has been rocked by factional clashes since late July between the Palestinian mainstream movement Fatah and hardline groups. The first round left more than a dozen people dead.
Fighting resumed over the weekend after a month-long ceasefire and has since left at least 10 people dead, according to two Palestinian sources in the camp. Six of them were fighters from Fatah and another two were other group fighters, they said on Monday.
The two remaining victims were civilians, a Lebanese security source and two Palestinian sources said. One was killed on Saturday when a stray bullet from the clashes reached a town near the camp, the Lebanese security source said.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, shared its own tally on Sunday saying four people were killed and 60 others wounded. It called for an immediate halt to the violence.
Five Lebanese army soldiers were also wounded, one of them critically, when shelling hit two of their positions on the outskirts of the camp on Sunday, according to an army statement.
"We will not stand idle with what is happening in Ein el-Hilweh," warned Elias al-Baysari, head of the General Security Directorate, in an interview with a local newspaper published Monday. "The situation in the camp is unbearable," he said.
Al-Baysari later Monday hosted a meeting at his office in Beirut that included officials from several Palestinian factions to discuss the possibility of a new truce.
More than 50 others were wounded, according to medical officials and state media.
On Monday, gunfire and explosions were heard throughout the day inside the camp and stray bullets hit the municipality building in Sidon damaging windows without hurting anyone, the state-run National News Agency said.
The public Lebanese University was closed and the Lebanese Army closed off the main highway that links Beirut with southern Lebanon near the camp and traffic was directed toward a coastal road.
Dire humanitarian situation
Ein el-Hilweh is the largest of 12 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, hosting around 80,000 of up to 250,000 Palestinians countrywide, according to the United Nation's Palestine refugee agency (UNRWA). The camps date back as many as seven decades to neighbouring Israel's founding in 1948.
UNRWA said hundreds of families displaced from the camp have taken shelter in nearby mosques, schools and the Sidon municipality building.
Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting near the camp in Sidon, said, described the situation as 'desperate'.
'Hundreds of families escaped the fighting, they've left their homes in Ein el-Hilweh. Others remain trapped inside,' Khodr said.
In some neighbourhoods, it is too difficult to venture out to reach areas outside of the camp, she said.
'These people were poor to begin with. The majority of Palestinians in Lebanon if they cannot work today, they cannot put food on the table,' Khodr said.
Many are relying on support from local charities. But even UNRWA is a 'cash-strapped organisation,' she added.
UNRWA appealed last week for $15.5m to repair infrastructure damaged in the last round of clashes in the camp, provide alternative education locations for children whose schools were damaged or occupied by fighters, and give cash assistance to people who have been displaced from their homes.
Khodr said it may need even more funding to repair additional damages reported over the weekend.
Separately, UNRWA said armed groups have taken over eight of their schools, forcing the agency to find alternatives to host students as the beginning of the school year nears.
The renewed violence has prompted fresh concerns that the clashes could spill over into the adjacent city of Sidon.
Residents fear a similar scenario to the northern Palestinian camp of Nahr al-Bared, where Lebanon's army waged a 15-week onslaught to dislodge armed groups in 2007.
A senior Fatah official is set to land in Lebanon on Monday and the acting chief of Lebanon's powerful General Security intelligence agency will hold an emergency meeting on the issue.

Netanyahu says not seeking to occupy Gaza but Strip must be 'deradicalised'

November 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country does not intend to occupy or govern Gaza, but the enclave must be 'demilitarised, deradicalised and rebuilt".
In an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday, Netanyahu said that Israel would need to find a 'civilian government' to govern the enclave, which has been run by Hamas since 2006, without specifying who would form such a body.
'We don't seek to govern Gaza, we don't seek to occupy it. But we seek to give it and us a better future and that requires defeating Hamas,' he said. 'I've set goals, I didn't set a timetable because it can take more time.'
Netanyahu said that a "credible force" would be needed to enter Gaza as necessary to 'kill the killers' and "prevent the re-emergence of a Hamas-like entity."
Netanyahu's comments come days after he said Israel would take responsibility for Gaza's security for an 'indefinite period' after the end of its war with Hamas, prompting pushback from the United States.
On Tuesday, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that President Joe Biden did not believe that reoccupying Gaza would be the 'right thing to do'.
Israel withdrew its soldiers and Israeli settlers from Gaza in 2005, but continues to maintain a blockade that controls almost all access to the Hamas-governed enclave by land, air and sea.
US officials have previously suggested that the Palestinian Authority should govern Gaza after the war, which Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said would only be possible under a political solution that returns territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Netanyahu on Thursday reiterated his opposition to a ceasefire with Hamas, as the  .
'A ceasefire with Hamas means a surrender to Hamas, surrender to terror," Netanyahu said, adding that Israel's military was performing 'exceptionally well' and would continue its campaign "however long it takes."
Israel has promised to eliminate Hamas in response to the armed group's October 7 attacks on the country, which Israeli officials say killed 1,405 people, mostly civilians.
Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 10,569 Palestinians, including 4,324 children, according to the health ministry in the enclave.

Israeli-owned ship targeted in suspected drone attack: Reports

A suspected drone attack has hit a container ship owned by an Israeli businessman in the Indian Ocean, according to a United States defence official.
The attack was likely carried out using an Iranian-made Shahed-136 drone on Friday, an unnamed US defence official told The Associated Press news agency on Saturday. Pan-Arab satellite channel Al Mayadeen also reported that an Israeli ship had been targeted in the Indian Ocean.
The drone targeted the Malta-flagged, French-operated CMA CGM Symi vessel while in international waters. The ship reportedly suffered damage after the drone exploded, but no crew members were injured.
The US official did not provide any evidence of an Iranian link to the attack, and said 'we continue to monitor the situation closely'. Iran has not commented on the reports.
Maritime security company Ambrey said in the days before the attack, the ship's tracking transmissions had stopped shortly after departing port in the United Arab Emirates.
"The vessel was managed by an Israeli-affiliated company, which was assessed to be the reason why it was targeted," Ambrey said.
According to the AP, the vessel's crew had been behaving as though they believed the ship may face a threat as they had switched off its tracking system since Tuesday, after leaving Dubai's Jebel Ali port. The ship had done the same earlier when travelling through the Red Sea past Yemen.
From Yemen, the Iran-aligned Houthis have   on southern Israel since Israel declared war on Gaza last month in the wake of a Hamas attack that killed more than 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. So far, the Israeli bombardment has killed about 15,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,150 children, Palestinian officials say.
Earlier this week, the Houthis also   which they said was Israeli. But Israel described it as a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo vessel with no Israeli nationals on board.
Iran and Israel have been engaged in a shadow war for years that has also included past claims of Iranian involvement in attacks on Israeli-owned ships. Tehran has officially denied orchestrating such attacks in the past.
If the attack on the Symi vessel came late on Thursday, it would mean it happened just hours before a truce between Israel and Hamas came into effect. Israel had also ramped up its attacks on Gaza in the hours preceding the truce, according to the United Nations.
Israelis and some other nationals held captive in Gaza were released on Friday in exchange for dozens of Palestinian women and children imprisoned in Israel. More exchanges are expected to take place until the end of the four-day truce on Monday, that may be extended.

US House votes to censure Rashida Tlaib over Israel-Hamas war comments

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United States House of Representatives has voted to censure Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, over her comments on the Israel-Hamas war.
The House voted 234 to 188 on Tuesday night to censure the three-term Democratic congresswoman from Michigan.
Some 22 members of her own party joined the Republicans in backing a resolution that claimed Tlaib had been "promoting false narratives regarding the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of Israel".
The punishment is one step below expulsion and follows a failed censure resolution last week.
More than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began its   a month ago after the armed group Hamas killed at least 1,400 people and took more than 200 captive in an attack on Israel.
The US, long Israel's most fervent supporter, has resisted calls for a ceasefire, despite growing global anger over the humanitarian crisis in the densely-populated territory of 2.3 million people.
While criticising the Israeli response and US support for it, Tlaib has also repeatedly condemned Hamas's assault.
Ahead of the vote, defended her position saying she would "not be silenced" or allow her words to be distorted.
With some progressive Democrat colleagues by her side, she stressed her criticism had always been directed towards the Israeli government and its leadership under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
"It is important to separate people and government," she said. "The idea that criticising the government of Israel is anti-Semitic sets a very dangerous precedent. And it's been used to silence diverse voices speaking up for human rights across our nation."
The debate on the censure resolution, introduced by Rich McCormick, a Republican from Georgia, was emotional and intense, with some representatives focusing on the slogan "  ", which Tlaib has used frequently, calling it an "aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence".
As she defended her position, Tlaib was overcome.
"Palestinian people are not disposable," she said, taking a long pause. Her grandmother lives in a village in the occupied West Bank.

Brad Schneider, a Jewish Democrat from Illinois, said he believed it was important to debate what the words meant.
"It is nothing else but the call for the destruction of Israel and murder of Jews," he said. "I will always defend the right to free speech. Tlaib has the right to say whatever she wants."
He added, "But it cannot go unanswered."
It was unclear if Schneider supported the resolution's final passage.
Other Democrats warned of the risks to free speech from the censure and the precedent it would set.
"This resolution not only degrades our constitution, but it cheapens the meaning of discipline in this body for people who actually commit wrongful actions like bribery, fraud, violent assault and so on," said Jamie Raskin, who defended Tlaib against the resolution.
Lawmakers who are censured are asked to stand on the floor of the House as the censure resolution is read aloud to them.
With the vote, Tlaib will become the second Muslim-American woman in Congress after Ilhan Omar to be formally admonished this year over criticism of Israel.
Republicans voted in February to   Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

A California university professor has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and battery in the death of a Jewish protester during duelling pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel rallies.
Paul Kessler, 69,   near Los Angeles.
Loay Alnaji, a professor of computer science at Moorpark College, was arrested early on Thursday, Ventura County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.
Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko later said that Alnaji would be charged with a count each of involuntary manslaughter and battery.
Kessler, who died on November 6, was among a group of pro-Israel protesters who appeared at a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Thousand Oaks, a suburb northwest of Los Angeles, the previous day.
Ventura County Sheriff Jim Fryhoff earlier this month told reporters that investigators had determined that Kessler fell backwards and struck his head, but video footage did not provide a clear view of a physical altercation between the two men before the fall.
Fryhoff said at the time that investigators had not ruled out the possibility of a hate crime.
The arrest comes as demonstrations continue worldwide over Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel and Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza.
About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died in the Hamas attacks, according to Israeli officials.
Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 11,500, including more than 4,700 children, according to the Ministry of Health in the Hamas-governed enclave.

Death tolls soar as fighting between Hamas and Israel rages

More than 800 Israelis and some 500 Palestinians have been killed   and bombardment following the largest attack by the Palestinian armed group Hamas against Israel in decades.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Monday authorities would impose a total blockade  , cutting electricity and blocking food and fuel supplies as part of 'a complete siege' on the Hamas-run enclave.
It came as Gaza's Ministry of Health said at least 510 Palestinians had been killed and 2,751 more had been wounded in Israeli air raids on the enclave since Saturday, when Hamas launched its multipronged offensive on Israel.
In Israel, the number of people killed has reached 800, with more than 2,200 also wounded.
The Israeli military said it hit more than 1,000 targets in Gaza, including air raids that levelled much of the town of Beit Hanoon, known as Erez to Israelis, in the enclave's northeast corner. The United Nations said more than 123,000 Palestinians in Gaza had been displaced amid the intense bombardment.
In Gaza, a tiny enclave of 2.3 million people sealed off by an Israeli-Egyptian blockade for 16 years, residents feared further escalation.
Al Jazeera's Jamileh Abu Zanoona, reporting from Gaza, said the territory's Shujayea neighbourhood was targeted by heavy bombardment on Monday.
A fourth mosque was destroyed in an overnight Israeli air raid on the Yarmouk neighbourhood in Gaza, forcing thousands more people to evacuate their homes, Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed reported.
'Dozens of homes were destroyed and are inhabitable,' ElSayed said.
Israel's chief military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, told reporters that Israel has taken 'control' of its communities following the mass incursion of Hamas fighters.
Hagari said there had been some isolated incidents on Monday morning, but that 'at this stage, there is no fighting in the communities'.
He added that 'there might still be terrorists in the region'.
Earlier, another spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Hecht, acknowledged that it was "taking more time than we expected to get things back into a defensive, security posture".
Israeli officials said 70 additional Hamas fighters infiltrated Be'eri kibbutz, which the military has been unable to wrest from Hamas, overnight.
The army has called up about 300,000 reservists and said in a statement  that Israel would aim to end Hamas's rule of Gaza.
"We have never drafted so many reservists on such a scale," Hagari said. "We are going on the offensive."
The attackers shot dead dozens of young Israelis – media reported as many as 260 killed – at an outdoor desert dance party. A day later, dozens of survivors were still emerging from hiding. The site was littered with wrecked and abandoned cars.
"It was just a massacre, a total massacre," Arik Nani, who had been celebrating his 26th birthday and escaped by hiding for hours in a field, told Reuters news agency.
Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have said they are holding more than 130 captives, adding they would be traded for the release of thousands of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
The captives are believed to include soldiers and civilians – including women, children and older adults – and to be comprised of mostly Israelis but also people of other nationalities.

'It is clear for me that there are all the criteria for the crime of genocide,' Devers told Al Jazeera, adding that cases such as ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda set the precedent against which the complaint had been submitted.
'So this is not my opinion, it's the reality of law."
Israel has made no attempt to hide the hallmarks of genocide, the group has argued, by cutting food and electricity to Gaza, attacking civilians and civilian infrastructure and using dehumanising talk that likens people to '  '.
The group also collected the witness accounts of Palestinian victims whom they legally represent in court.
With mounting allegations of serious war crimes being committed in Gaza, Devers said governments that did not wish to be found complicit should refrain from backing Israel.
'Governments must choose which camp they are on, if they support human rights or genocide. They cannot give speeches about international law and human rights and then accept Israel's attack without doing nothing,' he said.
Israel does not recognise the ICC, but Devers said that did not render the court ineffective.
In 2021, the ICC ruled that it has jurisdiction over grave crimes committed in occupied Palestinian territories, including potential war crimes committed by any party on the ground.
The initiative led by Devers is one in a number of lawsuits presented to the ICC in the past weeks.
On November 9,   urged the body to investigate Israel for 'apartheid' as well as 'genocide' and issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders.
#JusticeForGaza, another initiative, aims to bring together diverse voices from international civil society, political leaders and representatives to petition the court. Prominent European politicians who have advocated for Palestinian rights, including Spain's   and Britain's  , are among the more than 80 signatories of that petition.
Devers said the latest bombing of Gaza amounted to the most relevant crimes that the court had seen in decades.
'If the ICC does nothing, then it's the end of the ICC,' he said. 'We have sufficient proof for a mandate of arrest against Mr Netanyahu,' Devers said.
The ICC in March issued an   for Russian President Vladimir Putin's alleged involvement in war crimes in Ukraine. While Putin rejected the verdict and did not surrender to the court's jurisdiction, the decision was a symbolic moment and limited the Russian leader's ability to travel internationally, including to attend international forums.

October 28th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Here isthe situation on  , October 28, 2023:
Latest developments:
Gaza is being subjected to the   of Israeli attacks since the start of the war, as Israel's military is "expanding" ground operations in the besieged territory.
Israeli warplanes bombed 150 underground targets in the northern Gaza Strip, including tunnels, underground combat spaces and additional underground infrastructure, Israel's army said on Saturday.
Hamas said its fighters were clashing with Israeli troops in Gaza's northeastern town of Beit Hanoon and in the central area of al-Bureij late on Friday.
Telecommunications services are   across Gaza. Palestinian telecom provider, Paltel, said the bombardment caused "complete disruption" of internet, cellular and landline services late on Friday. Some satellite phones continued to function.
The United Nations General Assembly   calling for an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza, despite US and Israeli opposition. There were 120 votes for; 14 against; and 45 abstentions.
In New York, hundreds of   calling for a ceasefire in Gaza forced Grand Central Station to close after they took over the concourse on Friday night as part of an 'emergency sit-in' organised by anti-war group the Jewish Voice for Peace.
Human impact and fighting:
Gaza's health ministry said on Friday that Israeli strikes had killed 7,326 people, more than 3,000 of them children.
UN agencies say they are unable to contact staff in Gaza amid the near-total communications   and call for civilians to be protected. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said on Friday: 'In the last 24 hours 14 additional UNRWA staff were killed, bringing the total to 53 staff killed.'
Deborah Brown, the senior technology and human rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: 'This information blackout risks providing cover for mass atrocities and contributing to impunity for human rights violations.'
Amnesty International said the lack of communication in Gaza 'means that it will be even more difficult to obtain critical information and evidence about human rights violations and war crimes being committed against Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and to hear directly from those experiencing the violations'.
Save the Children says children will 'bear the brunt' of Israel's intensified attacks on the Gaza Strip. 'In the event of a full ground incursion, more than one million children's lives - nearly half of the 2.3 million population of Gaza - will be on the line."
Witnesses told an Al Jazeera reporter in the Gaza Strip that Israel has been bombing around the Indonesian Hospital and al-Shifa Hospital in the besieged territory. Hospitals in Gaza, including al-Shifa, have been sheltering thousands of civilians forced to flee their homes amid Israel's continued bombardment.
Diplomacy:
After the US voted   the UN resolution calling for a truce in Gaza, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, posted on social media: 'The lives of innocent Palestinians must be protected The lives of UN personnel and humanitarian workers and journalists must be protected. We mourn the loss of every single innocent life in this crisis. Every single one.'
Former UN special rapporteur Michael Lynk says the resolution, despite being non-binding, is 'a fairly accurate barometer of international diplomatic opinion and international public opinion' on the war in Gaza.
The Biden administration says it is 'not drawing red lines' for Israel, reiterating its unwavering support for the Israeli military campaign.
Two US officials told the American media outlet ABC News  that the US government has been 'pressuring Israel to adopt a narrower scope for its offensive and take a more incremental approach'. The Washington Post also reported that the Biden administration is urging Israel to pursue 'surgical' operations in Gaza, as opposed to a full ground incursion.
The US embassy in Lebanon has urged American citizens to leave the country 'now' amid fears that the conflict may widen.
 ,the new US house speaker, spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he posted on X. 'The House of Representatives stands with Israel and I reaffirmed our strong support,' he said in the post.
The Pentagon said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to his Israeli counterpart on Friday and 'underscored the importance of protecting civilians' during the Israeli military's operations and focused 'on the urgency of humanitarian aid delivery for civilians in Gaza'.
Escalation in the occupied West Bank:
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops   four Palestinians during raids, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA said.
Israeli forces raided the Jalazone refugee camp north of Ramallah, bring a bulldozer with them, Al Jazeera's Nida Ibrahim said, reporting from the West Bank.
Thousands of Palestinians prayed on the streets in the West Bank early on Saturday in a show of support for the Gaza Strip amid an Israeli military offensive against the enclave.
Protests in solidarity with the people of Gaza also took place in   in the West Bank on Friday.
At least 108 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank in the last three weeks, the Palestinian health ministry said.

Thirty bodies, most of them women and children, have been recovered from underneath the ruins of bombed buildings in  , the civil defence unit there told Al Jazeera.
Gaza's Ministry of Interior said there were many casualties following an Israeli air attack late on Sunday on a residential building in the largest of eight refugee camps in the strip.
At least 27 people were also injured, with hospitals saying they are struggling to treat the wounded.
'We are suffering from an acute shortage of medicines and medical equipment,' the director of the Indonesian Hospital in North Gaza told Al Jazeera.
Israel has continued to bomb the Gaza Strip for more than two weeks in response to an incursion by Hamas on Israeli soil on October 7. The strike on the camp comes as the death toll in Gaza climbed to 4,651 and the number of injured to 14,245 since the Hamas attack, according to the besieged enclave's health ministry.
'We will never be safe'
The densely populated Jabalia camp is also home to   run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
Some of these schools have been converted into shelters for hundreds of displaced families.
There were also earlier   by Israel. Amnesty International reports that on October 9, Israeli air attacks hit a market in the camp, one of the busiest areas in Gaza with a yet-unknown number of people killed in the attacks.
One resident of the camp who survived them says the events of the last two weeks have changed everything.
'For me,' Asmaa Tayeh, a young writer told Al Jazeera, 'I believe we will never be safe even after the war is over. In fact, I will never feel free as long as Palestine is occupied and its people terrorised.'
The   arrived in the Gaza Strip on Saturday and Sunday but aid groups say it is a fraction of what is needed as thousands remain trapped.
Before October 7, several hundred aid trucks arrived in Gaza each day.

Here is the   on Thursday, October 12, 2023:
Fighting
Israel's military said it was conducting a "large-scale strike" on targets belonging to Hamas in Gaza on Thursday. It did not provide details.
Israel has placed Gaza under a "total siege," stopping food and fuel from reaching the enclave of 2.3 million people, many of whom are poor and dependent on aid. Hamas media said electricity was cut after  .
Israeli shelling hit southern  in response to a new rocket attack by Hezbollah.
Governments around the world have arrangedrepatriation flightsfrom Tel Aviv as the war escalates.
Hamas fighters holding Israeli soldiers and civilians hostage have threatened to execute a captive for each home in Gaza hit without warning. There was no indication Hamas  .
Hamas's al-Qassam Brigades released a video appearing to show the release of a female hostage and two children.
British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly was seen running into a building in Israel as a siren sounded, in a video clip posted on social media platform X by the Israeli foreign ministry.
"We started the offensive from the air, later on we will also come from the ground," Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has told soldiers, in another indication that a ground offensive in Gaza will come.
Crucial life-saving supplies - including fuel, food and water - must be allowed into Gaza.
We need rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access now.
- António Guterres (@antonioguterres) October 11, 2023
Politics
Israel has formed  , with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sitting in a war cabinet with centrist former defence minister Benny Gantz.
The move came as the Israeli military pounds Gaza to root out the Palestinian group Hamas.
Human impact
The Palestinian Ministry of Health says the   has risen to 1,200, with about 5,600 wounded. The number of people killed in Israel has risen to 1,300, with more than 3,300 injured.
Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin announced that another citizen from his country has died, bringing the total number to 21   nationals killed following the Hamas attack in Israel.
Eleven workers with the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) have been killed in Israeli air attacks on Gaza, and five members of the ICRC, the organisations said. "Some were killed in their homes with their families."

Israeli volunteers helped gravediggers at Israel's main military cemetery as burials began for slain soldiers. "I decided that I'm going to do something for the people of Israel," one volunteer said.
Diplomacy and international reaction
Initial US intelligence reports show that key Iranian leaders were surprised by the unprecedented attacks on Israel by Hamas, according to a report by Reuters.
A surge in doctored images, mislabelled videos and graphic online violence related to the Israel-Hamas conflict prompted the EU to urge Big Tech to remove illegal contentor risk legal penalties.
Pope Francis called for the release of all hostages taken by Hamas fighters. He said Israel has a right to defend itself after seeing "a feast day turn into a day of mourning" but was "very worried by the total siege in which Palestinians live in Gaza."
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will arrive in Israelon Thursday, in a show of solidarity.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan   to Hamas's attack was disproportionateby "preventing people meeting their most fundamentalneeds and bombing housing where civilians live".
EU humanitarian support to the Palestinian people "is not in question,"European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, but the bloc must review its financial assistance.
Market and business
Oil prices fell   due to conflict in the Middle East receded a day after top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia pledged to help stabilise the market.
Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron said he would extend his five-year term "given the emergency situation and the challenges to the Israeli economy at this tough time", the central bank said.
The cost of insuring Israel's debt against default surged to thehighest levelsince 2013.
International airlines have suspended hundreds of flights to and from Tel Aviv following the attack. 
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stuck to her view that the American economy is headed for a soft landing. "Of course the situation in Israel causes additional concerns. I'm not saying soft landing is an absolutely sure thing. But I continue to think it's the most likely path."

US says doesn't support Israeli occupation of Gaza after war

US President Joe Biden does not support an Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip after the Israel-Hamas war ends, a White House spokesman has said.
Biden believes "a reoccupation by Israeli forces of Gaza is not the right thing to do", the White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters on Tuesday.
The comments come a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that Israel would take control of security in Gaza after the war.
Israel would take responsibility for security for an 'indefinite period' he told ABC News on Monday.
'When we don't have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine,' he said.
Kirby said on Tuesday that "there needs to be a healthy set of conversations about what post-conflict Gaza looks like and what governance looks like".
"What we absolutely agree with our Israeli counterparts on is what it can't look like, and it can't look like it looked on October 6," Kirby added.
US President Joe Biden has previously said it would be a "mistake" for Israel to occupy Gaza.
Israel launched an air and ground offensive against Hamas after the armed group carried out a deadly rampage in southern Israel last month, killing 1,400 people, according to Israeli officials, and taking more than 230 others hostage.
Israel's   of Gaza has killed at least 10,328 people, including 4,237 children, according to Palestinian health authorities.
Both Israel and Hamas have rebuffed mounting international pressure for a ceasefire. Israel says Hamas should release the hostages first. Hamas says it will not free them or stop fighting while Gaza is under assault.
Israeli ground troops have battled Palestinian fighters inside Gaza for more than a week, cutting the territory in half and encircling Gaza City.
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the country's ground forces "are located right now in a ground operation in the depths of Gaza City and putting great pressure on Hamas".
Israel unleashed another wave of strikes across the Gaza Strip on Tuesday as hundreds more Palestinians fled Gaza City to the south.
Some travelled on donkey carts, most on foot, some pushing elderly relatives in wheelchairs, all visibly exhausted. Many had nothing but the clothes on their backs.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have heeded Israeli orders to head to the southern part of Gaza, out of the ground assault's path. Many others are afraid to do so since Israeli troops control part of the north-south route.
But bombardment of the south has also continued.
In the town of Deir al-Balah, rescue workers brought out at least four dead and several wounded children from the wreckage of a flattened building, witnesses said. "My daughter," screamed a woman as she ran behind them.
An Israeli air attack destroyed several homes early on Tuesday in Khan Younis. At least five bodies – including three dead children – were pulled from the rubble, the Associated Press news agency reported.
Alongside the bombardment,   on Gaza, severely restricting access to food, water and electricity and cutting off fuel supplies for the more than 2.3 million people trapped in the sealed-off enclave.
A small amount of aid has entered through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, but United Nations chief   has called that assistance 'a trickle' of aid against an 'ocean' of need.
On Tuesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that a humanitarian convoy bringing medical supplies to   had come under fire in Gaza City, with a driver sustaining light injuries.
The ICRC did not identify the source of the fire.
The Rafah crossing was closed over the weekend after Israeli forces   heading to the crossing.

An Israeli air attack has killed and injured a "large number" of displaced people sheltering at a church compound in Gaza, according to the besieged Palestinian enclave's interior ministry.
The strike left a "large number of martyrs and injured" at the compound of the Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyrius Church in Gaza City, the ministry said on Thursday night.
Witnesses told the AFP news agency the air raid appeared to have been aimed at a target close to the 12th-century place of worship where many   as the war raged in the enclave.

The Israeli military told AFP that its fighter jets had hit a command and control centre involved in launching rockets and mortars towards Israel.
"As a result of the IDF [Israeli army] strike, a wall of a church in the area was damaged," it said, adding "we are aware of reports on casualties. The incident is under review."
Witnesses said the attack damaged the facade of the church and caused an adjacent building to collapse, adding that many injured people were evacuated to hospital.
Saint Porphyrius, built in about 1150, is the oldest church still in use in Gaza. Located in an historic neighbourhood of Gaza City, the church offered sanctuary to people of various faiths over generations.
The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem expressed its "strongest condemnation" of the strike.
"Targeting churches and their institutions, along with the shelters they provide to protect innocent citizens, especially children and women who have lost their homes due to Israeli airstrikes on residential areas over the past 13 days, constitutes a war crime that cannot be ignored," the patriarchate said in a statement.
Explaining the damage done to the church, the Israeli military claimed: "Hamas intentionally embeds its assets in civilian areas and uses the residents of the Gaza Strip as human shields."
Gaza has been hit by a relentless barrage of Israeli fire following an attack by Hamas fighters on October 7, which Israel says killed at least 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
Israel's campaign since has killed at least 3,785 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas health ministry.

Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv to call for the release of all captives held by Hamas, on the second day of a   between the Palestinian group and Israel.
On Saturday, friends and family of the captives and many supporters came together in trepidation in what has become known to Israelis as "Hostages Square", near the Ministry of Defence, amid a delay in the release of the second group of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.
Hamas delayed the release of the second group of captives, accusing Israel of violating the truce, which started on Friday and is expected to last for four days.
A spokesperson for Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs subsequently announced that "the obstacles were overcome through Qatari-Egyptian" mediation and the exchange was likely to go ahead on Saturday night, when 39 Palestinians and 13 Israeli captives would be released, in addition to seven foreigners.
The event in Tel Aviv also marked 50 days since the October 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel, in which   died, according to Israeli officials.
The Israeli aerial and ground assault on   has since killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,000 children.
On Friday, Hamas released 24 captives and Israel freed 39   held in its jails.
"Returning hostages is the biggest mitzvah there is," singer Ehud Banai told the crowd from the stage, The Times of Israel newspaper reported.
"With Hanukkah coming, we'll light many candles during this dark time. Our hearts are broken until we see all of them home."
Many people were wearing "Bring Them Home" campaign T-shirts, and holding placards with the names and pictures of the captives.
Israelis have   every weekend   in the last few weeks to put pressure on  , saying the government was ignoring their pleas to prioritise bringing their loved ones home.
Druze community leaders attending the rally on Saturday were warmly welcomed with enthusiastic applause from the crowd.
Demonstrators also gathered in front of one of Netanyahu's private residences in Jerusalem, calling for his immediate removal from office.

Israeli air strikes kill 28 Palestinians in southern Gaza

At least 28 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli air strikes on two residential areas of Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
A neighbourhood in Hamad was struck in a bombardment on Saturday, said Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed, reporting from Khan Younis. Dozens were also wounded in the attack that mostly killed children.
Another bombing then targeted a house in the town of Khuza'a, east of Khan Younis, she said.
"The total number of people killed is 28 people, but dozens have been injured and dozens still remain under the rubble especially in Hamad residential neighbourhood," ElSayed added.
The director of Nasser Medical Complex in the south said his facility received 26 bodies and 23 people with serious injuries after the Hamad strike, according to the AFP news agency.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have moved to the southern Gaza Strip after Israel ordered them to evacuate the northern region, claiming it would be "safer" amid Israeli forces' ground offensive there.
Two-thirds of them are now homeless.
In recent weeks, Israeli bombardments have also intensified in the south.
Residents in Khuzaa, Abassan, Bani Suheila and al-Qarara in eastern Khan Younis, the biggest city in southern Gaza,   Israeli aircraft dropped thousands of leaflets overnight on Wednesday and early on Thursday, warning them to leave.
'For your safety, you need to evacuate your places of residence immediately and head to known shelters,' the leaflets said. 'Anyone near terrorists or their facilities puts their life at risk, and every house used by terrorists will be targeted.'
It was not clear where residents in eastern Khan Younis were expected to flee as Israel had previously ordered people to relocate to this region for their safety.
In an interview with a US broadcaster on Friday, Mark Regev, an aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said they are asking people to relocate because they "don't want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire", indicating the Israeli army's plans to attack Hamas in southern Gaza after subduing the north.
Regev added that Israeli troops will have to advance into the city to remove Hamas fighters from what he alleged are underground tunnels and bunkers, but that no such "enormous infrastructure" exists in less built-up areas to the west.
"I'm pretty sure that they won't have to move again" if they move west," he noted.
"We're asking them to move to an area where hopefully there will be tents and a field hospital," he said, adding that the western areas are also closer to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, where humanitarian aid could be brought in "as quickly as possible".
But UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said that currently, his organisation "do not consider any part of Gaza to be safe".
Since October 7, more than 12,000 people in the Gaza Strip, 5,000 of them children, have been killed due to Israel's bombardment of the besieged enclave that is home to about 2.3 million people.

Hamas deal divides Israel politicians, seen as 'great harm', 'painful'

Israel's prime minister managed to secure a truce with Hamas with the backing of the far-right coalition partners he needs to stay in power, but several cabinet members expressed their displeasure at giving the Palestinian group too many concessions.
The agreement between Israel and Hamas reached early on Wednesday, with mediation from Qatar, includes a   and the release of 50 hostages being held in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinians jailed by Israel, among other measures.
While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet approved the truce, hardline members such as Minister for National Security   reiterated opposition even after it was announced.
"Hamas wanted this time-out more than anything else," Ben-Gvir posted on X, and said the pause would give the group time to resupply and reformulate itself, the dpa news agency reported.
Ben-Gvir also said on Wednesday that Israel was repeating the mistakes of the past, referring to a 2011 deal when more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners were freed in return for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been held by Hamas for five years.
After one cabinet member said it was important to send a message of unity, Israeli outlet Ynet reported that Ben-Gvir responded: "But we're not united. This decision will cause us great harm for generations."
Questions from lawmakers were answered by members of Israel's military and intelligence establishment, who sought to allay concerns that a pause in the fighting could stunt Israeli momentum after more than a month of relentless  .
President Isaac Herzog acknowledged that the "reservations are understandable, painful, and difficult," but added in a statement that given the circumstances he backed the government to move forward with the deal.
"This is a moral and ethical duty that correctly expresses the Jewish and Israeli value of securing the freedom of those held captive, with the hope that it will be the first step in returning all the hostages home," Herzog said.
Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel on October 7, which Israeli authorities say killed 1,200 people, and kidnapped about 240 people. The deadly assault has shaken Israeli society and   over the right path forward.
Representatives of the Religious Zionist party, led by right-wing Finance Minister  , voted in favour of the truce after expressing scepticism.
In a social media post, Settlements and National Missions Minister Orit Strock said that she had voted for the proposal 'even though I really didn't plan to' after 'detailed reviews, [and] questions answered thoroughly'.
Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas, but has faced growing scrutiny over actions in Gaza that critics have said constitute   of the besieged enclave's population.
Netanyahu has made clear that the agreement does not mean the war will stop, and vowed that the Israeli military will press on after the pause in fighting.
Israel has cut off access to food, fuel, and electricity for Gaza's more than 2.3 million residents and wiped out entire neighbourhoods in an assault that Palestinian authorities say has killed more than 14,000 people, with more than 5,600 of them  .
As conditions in Gaza reach breaking point, pressure had built for a pause in the fighting to allow humanitarian assistance into the beleaguered Gaza Strip.
Some Israelis, including those who lost loved ones or continue to await their return after being kidnapped during the attack, also called on the government to   of the hostages.
"People were not abducted abroad. They were abducted here, in Israel, from their beds,' said Regional Cooperation Minister David Amsalem, a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party. 'A huge failure took place here. Therefore, we must bring them back."
Israel's high court on Wednesday rejected a petition by the Almagor Terror Victims Association that said the deal would pose a threat to the country's security, according to Israeli media reports.
The petition argued that releasing some captives, but not all, violated the right to equality, according to The Times of Israel. It had called for a delay in the agreement's implementation until the government could prove that the truce did not endanger the lives of Israelis.
A 24-hour period in which the Israeli public could register legal objections to the government-approved deal had started on Tuesday night.

When a family dies under Israel's bombs, part of Gaza's history disappears

October 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza City – In the midst of harrowing numbers of Palestinian deaths and injuries under Israeli bombardment is a smaller figure: 20.
Twenty families have been erased from Gaza's cohesive society, in which everyone knows everyone else going back generations.
All the living generations of the 20 families have been wiped from the civil registry, as Palestinians say.
For seven consecutive days, the Gaza Strip has shaken under relentless Israeli air attacks. On Thursday, Israel said it had dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza, or an average of 1,000 per day.
The death toll in Gaza has now risen to at least 1,799 Palestinians, 60 percent of whom are women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. A further 6,388 people have been wounded.
Entire neighbourhoods lie in ruins and blackened rubble. The Israeli army said it is bombing in response to a surprise attack on Israel by the armed wing of Hamas last Saturday, which killed 1,300 people and wounded more than 3,000.
Israel's declared aim is to eliminate Hamas and dismantle its infrastructure, but it is the civilians trapped in the densely populated Gaza Strip who have borne the brunt of Israel's bombing.
'I saw death today'
In the Jabaliya refugee camp, 31 members of the Shihab family were killed in an attack. Other families had come to their building to hide, thinking it was safe.
A total of 45 people were killed in the  . The youngest victim was a two-month-old baby.
In Deir al-Balah, at least 15 members of the Azaize family  were killed – some of the dead could not be found in one piece.
In Gaza City, Hassan al-Batniji lost his entire family in one attack.
Asmahan al-Barbari's Gaza City home was bombed after she and her family returned to it, thinking they were safe.
Al-Barbari said everyone had rushed out of the house when they got an SMS warning from the Israeli military that they would be bombing the house.
"We grabbed our emergency bags that are always ready by the door, and ran," she said. "After we stayed away for the usual time, we headed back, thinking the danger was over."
Al-Batnaji's house was bombed in the middle of the night as the family lay sleeping. "We [found] ourselves buried under the rubble in the dark," he said. "I screamed their names to find out if they were still breathing.
"I saw death today. It didn't take my life. [It took] my family's. I wish I was killed too. … I will mourn them for the rest of my life."
His neighbour Mahmoud al-Shanti told Al Jazeera: "We were about 30 people in our house – elderly women, children – because so many families had fled their damaged areas to escape the violent attacks."
Al-Shanti, al-Batnaji and al-Barbari were all at Al-Shifa Hospital being treated and hoping to find safety.
Al-Shifa has emerged as a comforting spot for many of Gaza City's residents, who go there seeking news, an internet connection or a few minutes or electricity.
It is struggling to treat everyone, however, as Israel has stepped up its 16-year blockade of Gaza and is refusing to let necessities in, including food, water, electricity and medicines. The "complete siege" means there is a severe lack of the most basic and essential medical supplies.
Adding chaos to panic
Overnight from Thursday to Friday, the Israeli army dropped leaflets over Gaza ordering Palestinians   northern Gaza and Gaza City and head south.
Just over one million people live in the area Israel wants to clear, and while thousands did head south, many people stayed where they were because they could not arrange transport, chose to stay in their homes or heeded a call by Hamas to ignore Israel's demand.
Israel's attacks on residential areas have filled hospital corridors with injured people, some falling to the floor due to the lack of available beds, surgical rooms and intensive care units.
At the moment, much of the discussion being had to solve this situation has revolved around the idea of humanitarian corridors to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza. The suggestion to open an overland crossing into Egypt was rejected by Cairo, which did agree to open the crossing for humanitarian aid.
But Palestinian officials in Gaza argued that the urgency of the situation demands more immediate action to stop the bombardment and prevent further deaths and human suffering.
Health Ministry Director Munir al-Barsh said the Israeli air attacks have "criminally and systematically targeted residential blocks", which means that a majority of the victims are civilians.
"The bombing is targeting everyone, including homes, health facilities and ambulance crews," he said at a press conference on Thursday.
Israel says it will keep on targeting Hamas and resistance groups in Gaza.
Palestinians in Gaza are left living under the falling bombs and in the destruction, facing hunger, the lack of clean drinking water and the potential spread of infectious diseases.
As the number of victims rises and more and more families disappear from Palestine's rich tapestry of history and culture, there is a bewildered note to the mourning as people try to come to grips with what these disappearances mean.

Families of Gaza captives reject talk of death penalty for Hamas detainees

  of some of the captives taken by Hamas in the   have urged far-right Israeli lawmakers not to pursue a bill that would make it easier to use capital punishment against Palestinian detainees.
A number of suspected attackers were detained after members of the Palestinian armed group from Gaza killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel and kidnapped about 240, Israel said.
The proposal was advanced by the party of far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who posted on X on Monday: "The death penalty law for terrorists is no longer a matter of left and right. [It's] a moral and essential law for the State of Israel.'
Relatives of some of the people held by Hamas told a parliamentary panel that even discussing the death penalty could have catastrophic consequences for their loved ones held in Gaza.
"It would mean playing along with their mind games, and in return, we would get pictures of our loves ones murdered, ended, with the state of Israel and not them [Hamas] being blamed for it," Yarden Gonen, whose sister Romi is  , told Ben-Gvir and his party colleagues.
"Don't pursue this until after they are back here," she said. "Don't put my sister's blood on your hands."
The families of the hostages worry that even discussions of executions pose a danger to their relatives who have themselves already been threatened with execution at the hands of Hamas.
Gil Dilkma, a cousin to one of the captives, pleaded with Ben-Gvir to drop the legislation.
'Remove the law if you have a heart,' he said.
Striking a similar note, the Missing Families Forum said in a statement that such discussion 'endangers the lives of our loved ones without promoting any public purpose'.
Another family member of one of the captives echoed this concern,  , 'Stop talking about killing Arabs. Start talking about saving Jews!'
Some right-wing politicians responded to these objections with consternation. Almog Cohen, a member of the Israeli far-right Otzma Yehudit party shouted back, 'You have no monopoly over pain.'
'You are silencing other families,' another far-right politician said.
Deterrent or revenge?
Some Israeli politicians have argued in the past that more executions would serve to deter "terrorism".
When a task force was established by Israel's Ministry of Justice this month to find punishments "befitting the severity of the horrors committed" for those tried and convicted, the death penalty was refloated as an option.
Ben-Gvir called for capital punishment to be implemented, saying that doing this was "more critical now than ever … for the sake of those murdered and who fell in the line of duty and, no less, so that there will be no more people kidnapped".
The conservative Likud party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, has shown little interest in advancing the bill during its long rule.
The only court-ordered death sentence in Israel took place in 1962 when convicted Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann was executed by hanging. Israeli military courts, which often handle cases involving Palestinians, have the power to hand down the death penalty by a unanimous decision of three judges, but this has never been implemented.
Linor Dan-Calderon, three of whose relatives are being held captive, accused Ben-Gvir's party of having "confused priorities".
"You've gotten mixed up because we are a nation that pursues life not one that pursues revenge – even if in the past we did something to Eichmann," she said. "I am simply asking you to drop this from the agenda."

As US resists ceasefire calls, what is Biden's endgame in Gaza?

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - The United States is   calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but as the war rages on — killing thousands and risking an all-out regional conflict — questions are arising over its aims in backing the Israeli offensive.
US President Joe Biden has pledged unconditional support for Israel while warning against an expansion of the conflict, two goals that experts have said amount to competing priorities.
"Not only are they at odds with each other, but the higher priority of the administration appears to be supporting Israel, rather than making sure that there is no dangerous escalation," said Trita Parsi, executive vice president at the Quincy Institute, a think tank that promotes diplomacy.
US officials said they are asking Israel "tough" questions about its military  , including what the war's long-term objectives are. However, Washington's own endgame remains largely undefined.
The White House has repeatedly have repeatedly denied any "intention to put US boots on the ground". But the US is nevertheless bolstering its   in the region, and according to recent media reports, the Pentagon has sent advisers  to help Israel plan its looming ground invasion of Gaza.
And despite Biden's stated desire not to see the conflict expand, there are indications that it may still. There have been frequent clashes between Israel and the armed group Hezbollah in Lebanon, and US troops in the region have   — albeit limited — attacks blamed on Iran-allied groups in recent days.
While these skirmishes remain contained, analysts warned that they could   by design or miscalculation.
The U.S. and our regional partners are working to build a better future for the Middle East - one where it is more stable and better connected to its neighbors.
It benefits the people of the Middle East - and it would benefit us.
- President Biden (@POTUS) October 24, 2023
No clear objectives
So what is the US plan beyond enabling the Israeli military campaign logistically with military aid and politically with diplomatic cover  ?
"There does not appear to be a clear endgame from the Biden administration," Parsi said. "When it comes to this strategic image, it's very difficult to be able to discern a clear strategy that actually would have the desired results."
The conflict began on October 7, when the Palestinian group Hamas launched a   against Israel from Gaza. More than 1,400 people were killed, and dozens were taken captive.
Israel responded with a declaration of war the following day. It has since led a continuing bombing campaign that has killed more than 6,500 Palestinians in Gaza.
Adam Shapiro, director of advocacy for Israel-Palestine at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a US-based rights group, said it appears that the Biden administration has not "formulated" a clear objective despite fully backing Israel's war in Gaza.
Biden has called for  , but Shapiro said military efforts to root out the group are unlikely to succeed.
"So for them to be launching this kind of open-ended, unclear mission with a big named goal in mind that bears no resemblance to reality just seems [like] folly," he said.
"And I'm sure it's going to come back eventually to harm American interests in the long term."
Even more unclear, Shapiro added, is the fate of Gaza after a prospective Israeli ground invasion.
Biden has voiced opposition to re-establishing a permanent Israeli presence inside the besieged Palestinian territory, as it had in the past. From 1967 until 2005, thousands of Israeli ground troops were stationed there.
Brian Finucane, senior adviser for the US programme at the Crisis Group think tank, drew a parallel between the ambiguity of Israel's endgame in Gaza and questions about US strategy.
"The US objective in supporting Israel is undefined to some extent because Israel's own objectives in Gaza are undefined," Finucane told Al Jazeera.
He added that even if Israel topples Hamas, it has not articulated what might replace the Palestinian group, which currently governs Gaza.
Finucane also said "there appears to be some tension" between Washington's support for Israel and its push to avoid a wider conflict. If the Biden administration is unsuccessful in deterring Iran and its allies from  , a larger, regional war could end up involving US forces.
"And that should give policymakers in the Biden administration real pause. They should consider taking the advice they're offering to the Israelis themselves: Think through how is it going to play out," Finucane told Al Jazeera.
"What is the US endgame if we were to — God forbid — get into an armed conflict with Hezbollah, or a deepening conflict with Iran-back groups that are targeting US forces in Iraq and Syria with drones?"

'Negative consequences'
After the US wars in Afghanistan and  , politicians on both sides of the aisle have called for restraint in any future military endeavours, reflecting wider public fatigue towards overseas conflict.
But Finucane said the "atrocities" of Hamas's attack on October 7 "have shifted the conversation" in Washington.
Shibley Telhami, a professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland, said neither the US nor Iran seem interested in a broader military confrontation.
"However, they all could be dragged into this by some miscalculation or huge expansion of the war in Gaza," Telhami said.
He stressed that the US should not blindly back Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war efforts, as that stance might trigger direct American engagement in the conflict.
"You cannot leave that in the hands of an  , whose ministers are known to have views that are both at odds with American interests and at odds with American values," Telhami told Al Jazeera earlier this month.
Parsi, of the Quincy Institute, also stressed that attempts to deter Iran from joining the fray could prove to be unsuccessful without applying pressure to Israel as well to show restraint.
"It will very well lead to the very nightmare scenario I think the Biden administration wants to avoid," he said.
For now, the Biden administration is allowing Israel to carry out its intense bombing campaign, which has wiped out entire families in Gaza, according to Amnesty International . US officials have ruled out even discussing a ceasefire, saying that those conversations would ultimately benefit Hamas.
Washington is also preparing a   for Israel, including billions in military assistance.
Jon Hoffman, a foreign policy analyst at the CATO Institute, a libertarian think tank, connected the current US policy to its broader approach in the Middle East.
"I don't know the Biden administration has a clear objective here besides praying this doesn't spiral into a broader regional conflict," he told Al Jazeera.
"It should be clear from the past several decades that continuing to throw money, weapons and military assets at the region often has negative consequences."

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The leaders of 18 United Nations agencies have called for an immediate ceasefire in the Israeli-Hamas war, expressing 'shock and horror' at the mounting death toll from the conflict.
'We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It's been 30 days. Enough is enough,' the UN heads said in a rare joint statement on Sunday.
'This must stop now.'
The UN chiefs, including the leaders of UNICEF, UN Women, the World Food Program and the World Health Organization, described the killings of both Israelis and Palestinians over the past month as 'horrific'.
 , according to authorities in the Hamas-governed enclave.
More than 1,400 people, mainly civilians, were killed in Hamas's October 7 attacks on southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities.
'For almost a month, the world has been watching the unfolding situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in shock and horror at the spiralling numbers of lives lost and torn apart,' the UN leaders said.
The UN heads called on all parties to respect their 'obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law', including to protect civilian infrastructure such as hospitals and schools and allow aid into Gaza.
It is 'unacceptable' that the population of Gaza is being denied essential goods and services as well as being 'bombed in their homes, shelters, hospitals and places of worship," the statement said.
The UN leaders also condemned the killing of dozens of aid workers.
'More than 100 attacks against health care have been reported,' they said. 'Scores of aid workers have been killed since October 7 including 88 UNRWA colleagues - the highest number of United Nations fatalities ever recorded in a single conflict.'

Israel and Hamas have agreed to a four-day ceasefire mediated by Qatar that will see the release of 50 women and children held captive in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails.
The   was announced on Wednesday and the starting time is expected to be confirmed within the next 24 hours, according to a statement from Qatar.
The agreement also includes desperately needed humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza following weeks of relentless Israeli attacks that have killed more than 14,100 people, including 5,600 children, and forced about 1.7 million from their homes.
About 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's attack on Israel.
Here are some early reactions to the pause:
US President Joe Biden
In a statement , US President Joe Biden said he welcomed the deal and thanked Qatar and Egypt for their efforts to secure an agreement.
"Jill and I have been keeping all those held hostage and their loved ones close to our hearts these many weeks, and I am extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls, who have endured weeks of captivity and an unspeakable ordeal, will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented," he said.
He stressed it needed to be "carried through in its entirety" and that it was "important that all aspects of this deal be fully implemented".
US Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer
Chuck Schumer, who leads the Senate in the United States, said he was "pleased and relieved" that 50 captives would soon be returning to their families.
He also said it was a "positive development" that the pause in fighting would "allow additional humanitarian assistance into Gaza for the millions of innocent Palestinians who have nothing to do with Hamas" and said the Senate would "continue working to pass additional humanitarian assistance for innocent Palestinians, and make sure that Israel has the aid it needs to defend itself to ensure Hamas can never again pose such a threat to Israel".
Human Rights Watch, Israel and Palestine Director Omar Shakir
"Following the mass atrocities of recent weeks, today's agreement is welcome.
"Hostage-taking & blocking of life-saving aid are war crimes that are never justified. Human beings are not bargaining chips. Ceasefire or not, unlawful attacks should cease once and for all."

A US warship cruising the Red Sea has shot down drones fired from Houthi-held territory in Yemen, according to the US Central Command.
The USS Thomas Hudner, a guided-missile destroyer, shot down 'multiple one-way attack drones' launched on Thursday morning from Yemen's Houthi-controlled areas, CENTCOM said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
CENTCOM said there was no damage to the US vessel or injuries to its crew.

'Until Israeli aggression stops'
Yemen's Houthi rebels have declared themselves part of the "axis of resistance" of Iran's allies and launched a series of drones and missiles towards Israel since the start of the war in Gaza.
On Wednesday, Israel said it had intercepted a "cruise missile" heading for the south of the country, a shot claimed by the Houthi rebels.
The spokesperson for the Houthis' armed wing, Yahya Saree, said such operations would continue "until the Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank stops".
The Houthis have also threatened to target Israeli shipping over the country's war with the Palestinian group Hamas that rules Gaza.
On Sunday, the Houthis   an Israel-linked cargo vessel with an international crew of 25 at the entrance to the Red Sea.
Israel's military on Sunday said the seizure was a "very grave incident of global consequence", and a US military official said it was "a flagrant violation of international law".
Targeting US positions
US assets in the Middle East have also come under fire since the Gaza war erupted on October 7.
US forces deployed in Iraq and Syria have been attacked at least 66 times during this time, causing injuries to more than 60 personnel, the Pentagon has said.
On Wednesday, the US   its first significant retaliatory strikes on Iran-backed armed groups targeting it in Iraq, striking several positions of the Kataib Hezbollah militia, also known as Hezbollah Brigades, south of Bagdad, killing at least eight fighters.
Iraq's government condemned the assault as an 'unacceptable violation of Iraqi sovereignty', saying the US had not coordinated with it in advance.

Gaza could see return of PA in case of a 'political solution', says Abbas

The Palestinian Authority (PA) could return to power in the Gaza Strip only if a 'comprehensive political solution' is found to the Israel-Palestine conflict, according to PA President Mahmoud Abbas.
Abbas on Sunday met with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is on yet another tour of the region as Israel's   in Gaza nears a month.
'We will fully assume our responsibilities within the framework of a comprehensive political solution that includes all of the [occupied] West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip," Abbas was quoted as telling Blinken by the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
Israel says Hamas can no longer be left in control of the besieged enclave after the group's October 7 attack that left about 1,400 Israelis dead – a sentiment backed by Washington.
Hamas, considered a "terrorist" group by the US and the European Union, is a rival of Abbas's Fatah party.Hamas took over Gaza from the PA in 2007, after being blocked from exercising real power despite winning a parliamentary election the previous year.
Israel fully withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but imposed a crippling blockade on the coastal territory after Hamas took power.
Blinken made a surprise visit to the occupied West Bank on Sunday as Israel pressed on with its attacks on Gaza, where the death toll has reached nearly 10,000, almost half of them children.
Israeli ground forces also continue to  , engaged in heavy fighting with Hamas fighters, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently rejected   for a ceasefire.
In what appeared to be the most direct US position since the start of the war on October 7, Blinken told Abbas the PA should play a central role in the future of Gaza, the Reuters news agency reported.
The agency quoted an unnamed senior US State Department official as saying the 'future of Gaza was not the focus of the meeting but the Palestinian Authority seemed willing to play a role'.
Abbas and Blinken reportedly talked for about an hour in Ramallah but did not address the media, as Blinken had done during the previous legs of his regional trip.
Blinken said Washington is committed to getting aid into Gaza and restoring essential services after Israel cut access to food, water and electricity in the besieged enclave.
However, the US has also opposed a ceasefire, instead going only so far as to back a '  ' to facilitate humanitarian aid and allow some residents to exit Gaza through the Egypt-controlled Rafah border crossing.

American trapped in Gaza says he feels like 'second-class citizen'

October 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - When an Israeli air raid hit the building next to the house where he was staying  , Zakaria Alarayshi felt like he experienced death while still alive.
"We were confused and huddled together. It was death, death. You feel like you've died from the impact and the fear. I am a grown man, and I cried from the fear. Imagine what the children are going through. We had no idea what to do," he told Al Jazeera in a phone interview.
Alarayshi and his wife Laila Alarayshi are two of the hundreds of United States citizens trapped in the Gaza Strip amid the fighting between Israel and Hamas, which has killed thousands of people and levelled   in the Palestinian territory.
The Alarayshis had only planned on stopping in Gaza for several weeks to visit family. Now, their stay is indefinite, as the ongoing hostilities make travel perilous and border restrictions limit their options for escape.
Last week, the couple — residents of Livonia, Michigan — filed a lawsuit against the administration of   to compel the US government to evacuate Americans from the besieged strip.
Alarayshi, who said he voted for Biden in 2020, hopes the lawsuit will urge the US president to treat all Americans equally, no matter which side of the Gaza border they are on. The US has evacuated thousands of its citizens out of neighbouring Israel, including on a cruise ship.
"I worked three jobs. I built a business. I pay taxes. I did everything right to build a better future for myself and my family and live honourably. But now I feel like a second-class citizen. President Biden should take care of everyone," he said.
Biden is arriving in Israel on Wednesday, where he is expected to reiterate unwavering support for the US ally.
The lawsuit
Nabih Ayad, a lawyer and founder of the Arab American Civil Rights League (ACRL), a Michigan-based advocacy group involved in the lawsuit, said the US government has a duty to protect its citizens abroad.
"The fact that you are evacuating US citizens of Israeli descent but not US citizens of Palestinian descent creates a problem," Ayad told Al Jazeera. The lawsuit accuses the US government of violating constitutional provisions that ensure equality under the law.
Ayad acknowledged that the security situation in Gaza is dire, but he said the US has leverage over Israel and Egypt, two allies that border the Palestinian territory and can help with evacuations.
"Again, who's doing the bombing? What   are they using? It's Israel, our friend, that's going to be doing the bombing, using United States weapons, and they have control of all those borders," he said.
Israel has ordered more than 1 million Palestinians to leave the northern part of Gaza, but that has not spared the strip's southern region from a steady stream of bombardment. Israeli air raids have killed dozens in the southern cities of Khan Yunis and Rafah this week.
Khan Yunis is where Alarayshi and his wife currently reside, in order to be closer to the Rafah crossing, a vital thoroughfare into Egypt. But while Alarayshi has approached the border several times, he said US citizens have yet to receive safe passage across. The couple remain stuck.
Meanwhile, in Khan Yunis, they not only contend with daily air strikes, but the   is horrendous, Alarayshi said.
"There is no life. I go to the shop; there is nothing to eat," he told Al Jazeera.
"We eat once every 24 hours. We get cookies. We get a sandwich with a slice of cheese to eat. We used to buy water. Now there is no water, so we have to drink salty [tap] water. I have diabetes, hypertension and cholesterol. I'm in a dreadful state."
Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who represents a Michigan district, spoke about the couple's suffering during a briefing with reporters on Monday.
"I was on the phone with him at 1am making sure that he could get to the  . They waited there for six hours, and nothing," Tlaib said.
'No higher priority'
The US State Department said it "has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas".
"US citizens in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank in need of assistance should complete the crisis intake form on travel.state.gov," a State Department spokesperson told Al Jazeera in a statement.
"We will continue to provide updates to US citizens, including departure assistance, as information becomes available."
The statement did not address Al Jazeera's question on whether the US has a plan to get Americans out of Gaza.
Mariam Charara, the executive director of the ACRL, said the group has received the "same boilerplate responses" from US officials but no concrete action.
Charara, who has been in close touch with the Alarayshis, described them as an "amazing" family living the American dream.
But for now, the couple is not sure if they will survive. The home where the Alarayshis were staying in Gaza City was bombed after they left it.
"When  , it shakes the entire neighbourhood, and its sound makes you jump out of your body. It's very bad. My wife and I are not sure whether we will make it out of Khan Yunis. I don't know," Alarayshi said.

Israel's weapons industry: Is the Gaza war its latest test lab?

November 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Amman, Jordan – The Israeli army released footage on October 22 of its Maglan commando unit deploying a new precision-guided 120mm mortar bomb called the Iron Sting, against Hamas in Gaza.
The bomb's Haifa-based manufacturer, Elbit Systems, has been advertising its qualities on the public relations page of its website since March 2021, when it was integrated into the Israeli military.
Benny Gantz, then Israel's defence minister and now a part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war cabinet, described the Iron Sting as 'designed to engage targets precisely, in both open terrains and urban environments, while reducing the possibility of collateral damage and preventing injury to non-combatants'.
It's a claim echoed by Mark Regev, Netanyahu's former spokesperson, for the country's overall approach to its war on Gaza, in which, he has said, Israel is 'trying to be as surgical as humanly possible'.
Yet, more than one month after Israel launched the aerial bombardment of Gaza following a surprise Hamas attack, it has  , and injured 30,000 in the besieged strip and the occupied West Bank. More than 4,700 of Gaza's children are dead. Hamas fighters killed 1,200 people in their October 7 attack.
Israel's devastatingly 'surgical' killing machines, tested on Palestinians, have global takers, say analysts.

'Tissue torn from flesh'
Ahmed Saeed al-Najar, 28, was driving his taxi in Rafah during Gaza's third war of 2014 when a drone missile came in through the open sunroof of his taxi. It exploded in the car, instantly decapitating and killing all six of his passengers, his best friend included.
The car had been targeted by an Israeli Spike drone rocket, which can be modified to carry a fragmentation sleeve of thousands of 3mm tungsten cubes, said to affect an area of approximately 20 metres in diameter. The cubes puncture metal and 'cause tissue to be torn from flesh', literally shredding anyone within range, according to Erik Fosse, a Norwegian doctor working in Gaza.
Al-Najar, rescued from the wreckage of his car, suffered extensive burns, the loss of his right eye, multiple shrapnel wounds and the loss of his right leg from the mid-thigh point, amputated by the blast.
But by 2014, drones that carry the Spike rocket had already become highly sought-after by other countries.
The Heron TP "Eitan" drone is Israel's largest unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and was brought into service in 2007. Manufactured by the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) — Israel's largest aerospace and defence company and the country's largest industrial exporter – it can fly up to 40 hours continuously and can carry four Spike missiles.
The Eitan was first used during "Operation Cast Lead" in the 2008-09 Gaza war for attacks against civilians, according to the non-governmental organisation, Drone Wars UK. According to Defence for Children International, of the 353 children killed and 860 injured during Operation Cast Lead, 116 died from missiles launched by drones.
After the war, IAI witnessed a surge in orders of Heron variant drones from at least 10 countries between 2008-2011. During this period, more than 100 drones were purchased, leased or acquired under joint venture schemes.
India – Israel's largest military buyer, which operates more than 100 Israeli-made UAVs – purchased 34 Heron drones in this period, followed by France (24), Brazil (14) and Australia (10), according to a 2014 report  by Drone Wars UK.
That does not mean that Israel wages wars to advertise its weapons, said experts. 'Nobody fights wars just to show off their weapons,' said Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King's College London.
Yet, at the same time, 'in every war against Gaza a range of weapons and surveillance tech has been deployed against the Palestinians which is then marketed and sold to huge amounts of nations around the world,' said Antony Loewenstein, independent journalist and author of The Palestine Laboratory.

'An insurance policy'
Weapons exports have uses beyond the revenue they bring to Israel.
'It's more than that, it's also an insurance policy to insulate themselves from the intense pressure to change their behaviour over the decades-long occupation of Palestinians,' said Loewenstein.
Last month, Colombian President Gustavo Petro refused to condemn the surprise attack launched by Hamas on October 7 as a 'terrorist attack' instead responding that 'terrorism is killing innocent children in Palestine'.
In response, the Israeli government halted all sales of defence and security equipment and associated services to the Latin American country.
Colombia is one of an estimated 130 countries that have bought weapons, drones and cyberspying technology from Israel, the world's 10th-largest weapons exporter.
Israel is, by far, the world's largest exporter of military drones: in 2017, it was estimated that it was behind nearly two-thirds of all UAV exports  over the previous three decades.
Elbit, the maker of the Iron Sting, provides up to 85 percent of the land-based equipment procured by the Israeli military and about 85 percent of its drones, according to Database of Israeli Military and Security Export (DIMSE).
But after the 2014 Gaza war, its export market expanded significantly, too. Erbit promotes its Hermes UAVs as 'combat-proven' and the 'primary platform of the IDF in counter-terror operations'.
The Hermes 450 and Hermes 900 were both used extensively in "Operation Protective Edge", Israel's 2014 war, during which 37 percent of fatalities were attributed to drone attacks, according to an estimate by the Gaza-based Al Mezan Center for Human Rights.
Elbit subsequently secured contracts for the new Hermes 900 drone with more than 20 countries worldwide including the Philippines, which purchased 13, as well as India, Azerbaijan, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, the European Union, Mexico, Switzerland and Thailand. In March 2023, Elbit Systems announced their 120th order for the Hermes 900.
The new "Nizoz" (Spark) surveillance drone manufactured by Rafael, a state-owned weapons contractor that forms the Big Three of Israel's arms industry with IAI and Elbit, has reportedly now entered the current Gaza war. Rafael has an order backlog which currently stands at $10.1bn.
Al Jazeera approached Elbit Systems, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and IAI for comment but the firms were yet to respond before time of publication.

Hard to track
For all of its military export successes, the full extent of Israel's defence industry sales remains masked.
A report from Amnesty International in 2019 noted that the whole process by which Israel sells arms is shrouded in secrecy 'with no documentation of sales, one cannot know when [these arms] were sold, by which company, how many and so on'.
Amnesty found that 'Israeli companies exported weapons which reached their destination after a series of transactions, thereby skirting international monitoring'.
Israel has not ratified the Arms Trade Treaty, which prohibits the sale of weapons at risk of being used in genocide and crimes against humanity. As such, its weapons exports have influenced the course of history for several nations, many led by controversial regimes.
Israel sold weapons to the South African apartheid government in 1975 and even agreed to supply nuclear warheads, according to declassified documents – though Israel denies doing so. Napalm and other weapons were supplied to   during its counterinsurgency wars between 1980-1992 that killed more than 75,000 civilians.
In 1994, Israeli-made bullets, rifles and grenades were allegedly used in   which killed at least 800,000 people. Israel supplied weapons to the Serbian army that waged war against Bosnia from 1992-1995.
Despite the Israeli government's own statement in 2018 declaring it had ceased sales to Myanmar, the Haaretz newspaper  reported last year that weapons manufacturers continued supplying the military government until 2022, in violation of the 2017 international arms embargo against the country.
And, in September this year, Israel supplied UAVs, missiles and mortars to Azerbaijan for its campaign to recapture Nagorno-Karabakh, during which 100,000 ethnic Armenians were displaced.
Part of what makes it hard to track Israeli weapons exports is the very nature of the arms trade. 'Governments buy and sell to each other directly and through their large defence contractors, but also there is a parallel trade by private firms that is usually not illegal but provides plausible deniability,' Stephen Badsey, professor of conflict studies at Wolverhampton University, said.
The largest single control that seller nations maintain over the use of their weapons by other countries is the requirement for "end user" or "end use" rules, Badsey said. But as a major weapons exporter that doesn't subscribe to the Arms Trade Treaty, Israel has built a reputation for loose export norms.
In 2018, former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said he would ask his military to purchase weapons exclusively from Israel because, unlike the United States or Europe, Israel did not impose restrictions.
New government regulations introduced last year will allow Israel to sell more weapons to a greater range of countries without licences – and so, with less oversight. It pays: Israeli weapon export figures have doubled over the past decade, totalling $12.5bn last year.
Battle proven on 'human animals'
Two days after the October 7 Hamas attack, Israel's minister of defence Yoav Gallant compared the Palestinian people with "human animals".
To Loewenstein, the dehumanising comments were unsurprising. 'It is obvious over Israel's occupation and countless wars that Palestinians are treated as second-class citizens. Like animals,' he said.
Over the years, the Israeli army has tested rubber bullets, artificial intelligence-powered robotic guns and various forms of crowd dispersal solutions, which have inflicted severe injuries on Palestinians.
Nabeel al-Shawa, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon who has worked in Gaza since 1978, treated many Palestinians wounded by Israeli firing on the Great March of Return in 2018 – when tens of thousands of Palestinians demanded they be allowed to return to the land they were forcibly removed from in 1948.
'For Israeli snipers, this was merely target practice with humans,' he said. 'Most patients had been shot in joints deliberately to cause maximum damage, but not kill.
'These new rounds the Israeli army used caused injuries I have never seen before. In some cases the limb appeared intact, however, during surgery, I could not distinguish between bone and soft tissue."
So can Israeli weapons manufacturers legitimately market their weaponry as "battle proven" when the combat often targets unarmed civilians?
They can, said Zoran Kusovac, a geopolitical and security analyst.
'If a weapon's main purpose is proven in the actual battlefield or in as near realistic circumstances as possible, then they are battle proven,' he said. 'You cannot blame countries for buying from Israel. You can test all you want in a lab, but Israel is testing in the field, and as there are never any lags of time between one period of combat to the next, the development cycle is virtually in real time.
'And there is of course that adage; that if it's good enough for the IDF, then it must be good enough for us.'

New weapons test in Gaza 2023?
Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health in Gaza, last week said in a press statement that medical teams in the enclave had 'observed severe burns on the bodies of Palestinians who were killed and wounded by Israel's bombs - whether caused by an unknown weapon or not - is something they have not seen in previous conflicts'.
Dr Ahmed el-Mokhallalati from the burn and plastic surgery division at al-Shifa Hospital, in an interview with the Toronto Star , described the wounds as 'very deep – third and fourth-degree burns, and the skin tissue is impregnated with black particles and most of the skin thickness and all the layers underneath are burned down to the bone'.
El-Mokhallalati said that these weren't phosphorus burns, 'but a combination of some kind of incendiary bomb wave and other components'.
The Israeli military has not commented so far on the statement made by Gaza's Ministry. But the mystery incendiary bombs, the Iron Sting's debut and the reported use of the new Spark drone in the current war suggest that Israel is once again testing new weapons in conflict.
'Israel's weapons will continue to remain attractive to international buyers based on performance in the occupation,' Loewenstein said. 'But Israel is not just selling weapons; they're selling the ideology to other countries – of getting away with it.'

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken set to travel to Israel and Jordan

November 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
US Secretary of State   will travel to Israel and Jordan at the end of the week, the Department of State has announced, as tensions remain high amid Israel's escalating war against Hamas in Gaza.
State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Wednesday that Blinken will begin his trip on Friday, his second to the region in less than a month, with a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister   on the itinerary.
"He will reiterate US support for Israel's right to defend itself, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and discuss the need to take all precautions to minimise civilian casualties, as well as our work to deliver humanitarian assistance," Miller told members of the press.
The announcement comes as the US confirmed the first of its citzens were able to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing into Egypt.
Miller confirmed that "an initial group" of US citizens were among foreigners who crossed into Egypt, but did not give a number.
President Joe Biden said his administration would work to ensure more US citizens would be able to leave Gaza in the coming days.
Blinken's planned visit comes as Israel steps up aerial bombardment of Gaza and slowly increases ground operations within the strip, where Israeli air raids and a restrictive siege have created dire  .
Jordan   from Israel on Wednesday, stating that they would not return until Israel suspended its assault.
Israel has rejected growing calls for a ceasefire and has said that it is fighting to topple the Palestinian group  , which launched a   on southern Israel on October 7 that Israeli authorities say killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
Rights groups, international organisations such as the UN, and neighbouring countries such as Jordan have drawn attention to the devastating effect Israel's attacks and   have had on the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza, where authorities have said 8,796 people have been killed, more than a third of them children.
Arab countries condemned an Israeli attack on the densely populated   in northern Gaza on Tuesday, which levelled an entire block of apartments and killed dozens of people, according to Palestinian authorities.
Health services have also been  , or been shuttered, in Gaza, as Israel's siege chokes off access to necessities like fuel, electricity, and medical supplies.
The US has frustrated Arab allies by backing Israel, as officials temper statements of support with calls for Israel to adhere to international law during its campaign, but rejecting calls for an end to the fighting.
Asked about Jordan's decision to withdraw its diplomat from Israel, Miller said that the US shares 'the concerns they expressed about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza" but that reducing diplomatic channels is 'not productive'.

October 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza Strip – Heba Abu Jazar cannot hear the sound of the bombs exploding, but she can feel their intensity deeply.
The 28-year-old, along with her two brothers, was born deaf, but the magnitude of the powerful blasts can be seen and felt in the vibrations of the doors and windows in their home in the southern city of Rafah, close to the border between Gaza and Egypt.
"Everywhere in our region, there are explosions," she told Al Jazeera. "The forcefulness is very painful, and I can feel the house shaking violently with every air attack."
The lives of the Gaza Strip's 2.3 million residents have been completely upended since Israel began its relentless bombardment of the besieged territory on October 7, following an unprecedented attack by Hamas on army outposts and surrounding towns in Israel which killed more than 1,400 people.
Since then, nearly 7,300 Palestinians have been  , the majority of them women and children. Thousands of buildings across Gaza have been destroyed and more than one million people have been displaced in the territory, which has been largely deprived of medicine, water, food and other basic supplies on the orders of the Israeli government.
Heba's life has also changed drastically, having worked hard to integrate herself into society. Over the past year, she has developed her skills through a graphic design course, taken up photography and participated in various women's seminars.
"I began to feel that I can contribute to society, and my circle of friends expanded to both men and women," she said. "But this war, with its continuous bombings, has not stopped for a moment."
Access to the internet is rare – a few minutes a day – since Israel   the communications tower in the first week of the war. Heba uses that precious time to check in on her friends, before sitting with her brothers, as her mother informs them of what is happening around them.
During Israel's May 2021 offensive on Gaza, Heba's sister was injured when their neighbour's house was bombed, something Heba fears will happen again to her family.
"I thank God that my parents are not deaf, so they can tell us whether we are safe or in danger and save us from death,' she said.

In 2022, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights said the number of Palestinians with disabilities in the occupied territories was about 93,000, constituting 2.1 percent of the total population. Some 52 percent of that number, or 48,360, live in the Gaza Strip, while the rest reside in the occupied West Bank.
Human Rights Watch said, under the Israeli offensives on the territory, people with disabilities remain among the most affected.
Furthermore, the 17-year siege on the Gaza Strip by Israel and Egypt has led to heavy restrictions on movement and has curbed access to assistive devices and healthcare for people with disabilities. Chronic power outages compromise the rights and freedoms of these vulnerable people of society, who rely heavily on electric equipment to move around, such as elevators and mobility scooters, and light to use sign language with others.
'Without wars, Gaza is a beautiful place'
In 2019, the first beach for people with disabilities was inaugurated to the west of Gaza City. Called Muwa'imah Beach, the place holds special memories for Suha Maqat, who has a mobility impairment and uses crutches to get around.
"Each week, I'd meet my friends and teammates at the sports club and train for two hours, playing basketball in wheelchairs," the 34-year-old from Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood said.
"We'd then go to Muwa'imah Beach, and spend time by the sea, chatting and whiling away the hours. Life was beautiful back then. I always said that without wars, Gaza is a beautiful place."
Suha said she likes to go out frequently as she refuses to see her disability as an impairment and does not like being stuck indoors between four walls.
But now, she has no choice but to remain in her house. In fact, she refuses to leave it.
"If I die, I'll die in my own home," she said. "Where would I go? We don't know anyone in the southern Gaza Strip and during war, everyone is looking out for themselves and can barely take into consideration the fate of the people around them."

During the last war in 2021, Israeli warplanes targeted a building next to Suha's home, which knocked her to the floor. Unable to move, she had to wait for her neighbours to carry her out, which she swore would not happen again.
"I do not want that scene of torment when I fell to the ground to be repeated again when everyone was trying to escape from the warplane's missiles," she said.
She dismissed the Israeli military's repeated orders to the Palestinians in northern Gaza to head south.
"Israel doesn't care about civilians," Suha said. "They only care about death and destruction. I've lived through five wars, but this by far has been the worst of them all."
'Israel and its wars create more disabled people'
The devastation wreaked by Israel over the past 19 days has changed much of the Gaza Strip's landmarks, with entire neighbourhoods flattened and main roads destroyed. Both Suha and her friend, Rabab Nofal, wonder how even an able-bodied person is expected to move around, let alone one with a disability.
"Before the war, we had difficulties going to most places because the streets are not good enough or equipped for wheelchair users like myself," Rabab said. "But I could still put my three-year-old child in my lap and go to the stores to buy things. Now, how can we move?"
According to the Gaza government's media office, Israel has bombed the Gaza Strip with more than 12,000 tonnes of explosives, which is equivalent to the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.
This would mean that, on average, 33 tonnes of bombs were dropped per square kilometre, in one of the most densely populated areas of the world which is 41km long and 10km wide (25 miles by 6 miles).
Rabab sighed, thinking back to her "lovely routine" before the war, which comprised mainly of going to the beach and finishing some embroidery with the waves gently lapping the shore.
"Now the sounds of missiles make it impossible for us to move from our homes," she said. "Israel and its wars greatly oppress people with disabilities and create more disabled people – those who have lost their limbs to the bombardment."

'No future' for Palestine's children
Another Palestinian who has refused to leave his home in Gaza City even after it was destroyed in an Israeli air attack is Mahmoud Abu Namous, who has a hearing disability.
"This is the second time my home got destroyed," the 33-year-old said. "Last time, it was in 2021, when my wife was pregnant with our daughter, Fatima. I was afraid I would lose them both."
Mahmoud said it was not in his nature to complain about life, and that he had always been accepting of his disability. He has always advocated for sign language to be used at events, to improve communication with others.
"Sign language is useful during the war so we can know what is going on", he said. "In previous wars, I would message my friends on a Facebook group, but in this war, communication with everyone is cut off. There's no electricity and no internet."
He dreamed of giving Fatima a life that she deserves, and not being homeless without a roof over her head.
Mahmoud has rejected the idea of having more children, saying that the more than 3,000 children killed by Israel in this war so far shows it is impossible for parents to provide a decent future for their children. He says he wonders if there will even be one.
"It is enough that I have this child of mine," he said. "I will try to protect her from the occupation as much as possible. We love children, but Israel hates them."

Gaza 'approaching a truce agreement' with Israel, says Hamas leader Haniyeh

Hamas officials are "approaching a truce agreement" with Israel after weeks of the  , according to Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the Palestinian group that rules the besieged enclave.
The group delivered its response to Qatari mediators in the ongoing talks, Haniyeh said in a statement to Reuters news agency on Tuesday morning.
The statement gave no more details, but a Hamas official told Al Jazeera that negotiations were centred on how long the ceasefire would last, arrangements for delivery of aid into Gaza and the exchange of Israeli captives held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israel.
Both sides will free women and children and details will be announced by Qatar, which is mediating in the negotiations, said Ezzatel-Reshiq.
The agreement will include a ceasefire, arrangements for aid trucks to supply all areas in Gaza, and transfer of the injured to other countries for treatment, according to el-Reshiq.
He said the talks between the warring sides have been going on for weeks, adding that the Israeli side was stalling the agreement.
The Hamas official said the deal was agreed upon by all the brigades in Gaza through phone calls, "as we are always united whether it is on the battlefield or in making political decisions".
Separately, in remarks quoted by Israel's Walla news website, Hamas senior official Yahya Sinwar said the agreement would prohibit the activity of Israeli aircraft in Gaza during the truce.
UN resolution
Talk of an imminent deal on captives has been circulating for days as Qatari mediators sought the agreement for Hamas and Israel to exchange captives for prisoners in return for a temporary ceasefire that would boost emergency aid shipments to Gaza civilians.
Last week, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling for "urgent and extended   and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip"to allow for aid delivery and medical evacuations after four failed attempts to respond to the Israel-Hamas war.
The resolution, introduced by Malta on Wednesday, also called for "corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days" to safeguard civilians, particularly  , Ambassador Vanessa Frazier told the Council.
The UN chief, Antonio Guterres, said on Monday that the world was witnessing an "unparalleled and unprecedented" level of civilian death in Gaza compared with any other conflict since he became the international organisation's secretary-general in 2017.
"What is clear is that we have had in a few weeks thousands of children killed, so this is what matters," Guterres said in New York while presenting a new UN environmental report.
At least 13,000 Palestinians – about 5,600 of them children and 3,500 women – have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its air and ground assault on Gaza after the October 7 attacks by Hamas targeting Israel, according to the Ministry of Healthin Gaza.
Hamas and allied groups took about 240 captives during their incursion into southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.

Israel strikes Gaza's biggest hospital complex, health officials say

Israel has attacked three hospitals in Gaza, including the enclave's biggest medical complex, resulting in what appear to be multiple casualties, the Health Ministry in the Hamas-governed enclave has said.
An Israeli strike hit a yard at the al-Shifa Hospital complex, where thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said on Friday.
'Israel is now undertaking these dangerous steps against the hospitals to put them completely out of commission and subsequently displace the people sheltering in them, as well as the patients and medics,' al-Qudra told Al Jazeera.
Israel's military has said that Hamas operates a command centre at the site of the hospital, including entrances to its extensive tunnel network, which Hamas and hospital officials have denied.
Israeli officials did not immediately comment on reports of the latest strikes.
Mohammad Abu Salmiya, director general of al-Shifa Hospital, said the strike hit civilians located next to a number of journalists in the yard, wounding four, including two critically.
'This led to a lot of casualties, including critical injuries. It could have been a massacre in this place because of the number of people in this complex,' Abu Salmiya told Al Jazeera.
'Before that, they bombed a building very close to the hospital. And now, there are heavy clashes and heavy bombing next to the hospital.'
Abu Salmiya said that medics and patients were in a state of fear due to near-constant explosions near the facility.
'Not a second goes by without bombing close to the hospital. Many of the hospital's windows have been broken, and there is fear and anxiety amongst the medics and the patients and the displaced people,' he said.
'This is a war against the hospitals and a war against all the [Palestinian] citizens.'
Video of the apparent aftermath of the attack showed several people screaming and scrambling for cover, and an injured man lying on the pavement in a pool of blood.
Al-Qudra said that two children's hospitals, Al-Rantisi and Al-Nasr, had also been hit by "direct attacks and bombardments" on Friday.
Omar Shakir, Human Rights Watch's Israel and Palestine director, said on social media that medical facilities must be protected and that "no area is a free-fire zone".
The attack on al-Shifais the latest in a series of reported strikes on or near the Gaza City hospital in recent days.
Last week, Israel's military bombed an ambulance outside the hospital, killing 15 people, according to Palestinian officials.
On Monday, Al Jazeera and Palestinian media reported that Israeli forces had struck solar panels providing electricity to the medical complex, prompting denials by Israeli officials.
Israeli military officials have released pictures, illustrated maps and audio recordings that they say show that Hamas is using the facility to plan operations and hide its fighters.
"Hamas terrorists operate inside and under [al-Shifa] Hospital and other hospitals in Gaza," spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said last month.
Hamas, health authorities and al-Shifa Hospital officials have denied that the armed group is hiding in or under the complex.
Israel's military has repeatedly ordered the hospital to evacuate in recent weeks, drawing condemnation from humanitarian groups that say medical facilities must be spared from fighting.

The United States and the United Kingdom have announced jointly coordinated sanctions targeting the Palestinian armed groups   and   (PIJ).
In a statement on Tuesday, the US Department of the Treasury said that it was imposing a third round of sanctions on Hamas, targeting the group's leadership and and the mechanisms through which Iran provides support to the group and the PIJ.
'Hamas's actions have caused immense suffering and shown that terrorism does not occur in isolation,' US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in the statement.
'Together with our partners we are decisively moving to degrade Hamas's financial infrastructure, cut them off from outside funding, and block the new funding channels they seek to finance their heinous acts.'
Britain added sanctions on four Hamas senior leaders and two financiers, the Foreign Office said in a statement, including the group's political leader in Gaza and the commander of its military arm.
The fresh sanctions against Hamas come more than one month after the group launched a   on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel has vowed to eliminate the group, launching a ground offensive and hammering the   with air strikes, severely restricting food, water and electricity and cutting off fuel supplies to Gaza's more than 2.3 million residents.
Palestinian authorities in Gaza say more than 11,200 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, including more than 4,600 children.
About 70 percent of people in Gaza have   by the fighting after the Israeli military ordered people in northern Gaza to move south, but Israel continues to bombard the southern end of the  .
The latest sanctions focus on Hamas leaders, as well as individuals and entities who allegedly act as conduits for Iranian funding. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US would continue to work with other countries to "disrupt these terrorist financing channels".
In a press release, the Treasury Department said that the US has designated Mahmoud Khaled Zahhar, who it calls a 'senior member and co-founder' of Hamas.
The United States, in coordination with the UK, is imposing sanctions on individuals and entities that have supported Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist groups. We continue to coordinate with our partners and allies to disrupt these terrorist financing channels.
- Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) November 14, 2023
The sanctions also target the Lebanon-based money exchange company Nabil Chouman & Co, which the US says is used by Hamas to transfer money from   to Gaza. The owner of the company and his son were both also designated.
The US also took aim at the smaller PIJ, which is allied with Hamas and took part in the October 7 attacks, sanctioning Nasser Abu Sharif, the group's representative to Iran, and Akram al-Ajouri, the group's deputy secretary-general.
The sanctions freeze any US assets held by the designated individuals or entities and generally bar people in the US from dealing with them.
