Anti-semitic slogans projected on University of Pennsylvania buildings
The Times of India (TOI)

NEW DELHI: Anti-semitic slogans were projected onto buildings at the University of Pennsylvania in the latest incident at the Ivy League college. The university is now confronting a civil rights complaint, alleging that it has become a "magnet for anti-Semites."“From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” one of the messages lit up against the John M Huntsman hall read. There were several similar messages such as, “Zionism is racism”, “Penn funds Palestinian genocide” and more. Images of the incident, described as a "light show," circulated on social media, as reported by the New York Post.University President Liz Magill has acknowledged a surge in anti-semitic incidents on campus, which includes the presence of ‘swastikas’ and hateful graffiti’. Additionally, she highlighted instances of “chants at rallies, captured on camera and widely circulated, that glorify the terrorist atrocities of Hamas, that celebrate and praise the slaughter and kidnapping of innocent people and that question Israel's very right to exist”.The pervasive anti-Jewish atmosphere has led the Brandeis Center to file a complaint against the University of Pennsylvania, along with Wellesley College, with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in the US Department of Education. 
The complaint alleges, “Penn has allowed its campus to become a hostile environment for its Jewish students as well as a magnet for anti-Semites.”The founder and chairman of the Brandeis Center and former US Assistant Secretary of Education, Kenneth L. Marcus claims that educational institutions have “failed to keep Jewish students safe and are in clear violation of well-established federal civil rights law”. “There’s been a lot of talk about rooting out anti-Semitism on campuses, and it’s time to hold these colleges accountable,” he said.As per a statement by a human rights non-profit, the complaints are seeking “immediate and specific action to address increasing discrimination against and harassment of Jews in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In a letter sent earlier this month, two dozen members of Congress criticized the University of Pennsylvania for what they perceived as a lack of prompt and unequivocal condemnation of the Hamas attack.On Monday, a number of University's staff members reportedly received specific anti-semitic emails containing threats of violence against members of the university's Jewish community, including those associated with Penn Hillel and Lauder College House. The emails allegedly “threatened violence” against Jewish individuals at the university, particularly those affiliated with Penn Hillel—a Jewish organization on campus—and Lauder College House, as stated by UPenn's President in a statement on Monday.“These messages also included hateful language, targeting the personal identities of the recipients,” Magill said.“Threats of violence are not tolerated at Penn and will be met with swift and forceful action. The perniciousness of anti-semitic acts on our campus is causing deep hurt and fear for our Jewish students, faculty, and staff and shaking their sense of safety and belonging at Penn. This is intolerable. I condemn personally these vicious and hateful anti-semitic acts and words,”  she added.The college's public safety officers did not find a credible threat but have increased security measures across the campus. The university has informed the FBI about the potential hate crime and is actively investigating the threats. UPenn authorities are collaborating urgently with the FBI to  ”identify the individual or individuals who are responsible for these hateful, threatening emails and to ensure they are apprehended and punished to the fullest extent of the law,” Magill said.Meanwhile, a student, believed to be from UPenn, was recorded expressing feeling "empowered and happy" about the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas against Israel. The clip, circulating online and shared by Bronx Rep. Ritchie Torres, shows the back of the woman as she spoke at a pro-Palestine rally, saying, “I remember feelings so empowered and happy, so confident that victory was near and so tangible. I want all of you to hold that feeling in your hearts. Never let go of it. Channel it through every action you take.”Following the heinous Hamas attack, the leadership of the University of Pennsylvania faced criticism for what some perceived as a delay in disavowing the violence. Even before the terrorist incident on October 7, the Ivy League campus had already received substantial criticism for hosting a Palestine Writes literature festival. This event featured speakers and invitees who had previously been accused of making anti-semitic statements. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'Going to funeral after funeral': Man recalls horror tale of Hamas attack on Israel music festival

NEW DELHI: In the fatal attack unleashed by Hamas terrorists at Israel's music festival, 22-year-old Gal Katz was, fortunately, able to escape the attackers' eyes as he slipped into an orange grove and remained motionless for at least six hours until Israeli soldiers arrived.Recalling the bloodbath that claimed the lives of over 250 people present in the festival, Katz told CNN that he and one of his friends waited for the terrorists to leave the site while feeling "the earth shake under us".Katz said he has been "going to funeral after funeral" as his other friends could not escape the massacre."I'm going to funeral after funeral. It's surreal. Before we knew it was a terrorist invasion, when there were only rockets, I gave my friends - a couple - a call. 
They told me, 'Don't worry about us, we got in the car, we're in a shelter.' These shelters are all over the South. You can get inside in case of an alarm - a kind of metal box, very strong, against missiles," CNN quoted Katz as saying."I was like, 'Oh, that's so good.' In my mind, I wanted to be in there too. Those who hid there didn't make it. The terrorists saw them, they opened the door and just ... maybe they threw a grenade, maybe they sprayed them with the AK. Including my friends. Today was the funeral of the girl. Yesterday was the funeral of her boyfriend. We came together to the party. And they didn't make it. They didn't return home," Katz further said.The October 7 attack by Hamas saw fighters shoot, stab and burn to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians. Israel in retaliatory attacks days since has flattened neighbourhoods and killed at least 2,670 people in Gaza, the majority ordinary Palestinians.Meanwhile, Palestinians in besieged Gaza crowded into hospitals and schools, seeking shelter and running low on food and water. More than a million people have fled their homes ahead of an expected Israeli ground invasion aimed at destroying Hamas after its fighters rampaged through southern Israel.More than one million people have fled their homes in Gaza in scenes of chaos and despair as Israel bombarded the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip and continued amassing troops Monday in preparation for an expected full-blown ground invasion.

Oxford students follow their Harvard peers and blame Israel for all the violence

LONDON: Student groups at Oxford University have issued a joint statement saying "Israeli-settler-colonial occupation and apartheid" is the root cause of the ongoing violence, reflecting a joint statement by 33 student societies at Harvard University, which blamed Israel for the Hamas attack on Israel.The Oxford statement, signed by 14 groups, including Oxford Palestine Society, Oxford South Asian Society, and the Oxford South Asian Ambedkar Forum, said: "This continuous harm is rooted in the tragedies of illegal occupation, human rights abuses and apartheid that have existed since the onset of the Nakba in 1948. We call for an immediate end to Israel's genocidal assault on Gaza. The events of the past several days did not take place in a vacuum: rather they are the result of Palestinians' long-brewing and well-founded anger in response to Israel forcing them to live in an open-air prison for decades. Every nation that has declared support for Israel is complicit in its genocidal campaign."A University of Oxford spokesperson said: "Oxford University's primary focus is the health and well-being of staff and students impacted by the terrible events in Israel and Gaza, and it has written directly to those affected to offer welfare and other types of support."Student societies must be registered with the Proctors' Office to use the name "Oxford University". Notall the societies which have signed this statement have done so.The Harvard statement, put out on the same day that Hamas launched its attack on Israel, held "the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all the unfolding violence". Neither statement criticised Hamas. 
The Harvard one sparked a huge backlash in the US, with business leaders demanding to see the names of the students who signed it. Harvard University president Claudine Gay had to issue a statement distancing herself from their statement.In a speech at the SNP conference in Aberdeen on Sunday, Scotland First Minister Humza Yousaf's wife, Nadia El-Nakla, described the situation in Gaza as "unimaginable horror" and pleaded with world leaders to "strive for peace over war".El-Nakla's Palestinian father, Maged, and Scottish mother, Elizabeth, are currently trapped in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, with no electricity or water, and food running out. They had gone there to visit family.El-Nakla said people were sleeping outsideon football pitches having bombs dropped on them and they were using ice cream trucks for dead bodies. Her brother, an ER doctor, told her hospitals were starting to be unable to treat patients owing to no supplies. "Families are having to say goodbye to each other as if it is the last time. Every person in Gaza is waiting to die," she said. "Give the children of Gaza a chance of life."Yousaf told the BBC that Israel is "going too far" and "collective punishment cannot be justified" as many of the people in Gaza "have nothing to do with Hamas".

Israel to remove Greta Thunberg from school curriculum over 'anti-Israel' post

NEW DELHI: Days after Israel criticised Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg over what it said was an 'anti-Israel' post on X (formerly Twitter), Israel's education ministry has said it will remove any reference to Thunberg in its school curriculum. The 20-year-old faced criticism over the weekend after she posted on X: "Today we strike in solidarity with Palestine and Gaza. The world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected."As per a report by The Jerusalem Post, the education ministry said Thunberg's "stance disqualifies her from being an educational and moral role model, and she is no longer eligible to serve as an inspiration and educator for Israeli students"."Due to her position, when Greta addresses a different topic superficially and dismissively, it inevitably weakens the validity of her climate-related positions," read the statement by the education ministry. 
"People from all walks of life might think that the shallowness she displayed on the other issue could cast doubt on the seriousness and depth of her climate activism. Those with vested interests could exploit this to portray climate activists as unserious and lacking depth. Therefore, even without addressing the ethical and moral implications she ignored, Greta is no longer a role model for us in the climate change context. We have plenty of other figures to look up to," it added.Several pro-Israel activists also released an open letter to Thunberg stating they were "deeply hurt, shocked and disappointed with your tweets and posts regarding Gaza" and that Thunberg should "look again at the atrocities conducted by Hamas".

Centre launches Operation Ajay to evacuate Indians from Israel

NEW DELHI: In its first response to the Israel-Hamas war, the government Wednesday launched Operation Ajay to facilitate the return from Israel of Indian nationals who wish to return and set up a 24-hour control room to monitor the situation there.  Foreign minister S Jaishankar said special charter flights and other arrangements were being made and that India remained fully committed to the safety and well-being of Indian citizens abroad. The first flight is expected to be operated on Thursday.There are 18,000 Indian nationals currently in Israel and PM Modi raised the issue of their safety in his phone conversation with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week. 
The MEA, however, did not make any comment on the conflict, apparently because it believes what Modi has said till now on X, formerly Twitter, appropriately captures its position.Expressing solidarity with Israel shortly after the unprecedented Hamas rocket attacks on Israel, Modi condemned the action as terrorist strikes and reiterated India's unequivocal condemnation of terrorism.The government has so far not called for an end to the violence or offered humanitarian assistance to its victims unlike its close Gulf strategic partner UAE which, while condemning Hamas' actions, has qualified its position by calling for protection of civilians on both sides and despatching humanitarian assistance worth $20 million to the Palestinians. India, however, has been closely following reports of fatalities piling up on both sides amid fears that the conflict could lead to a full-blown conflagration in a region that has been its primary source of energy and home to a large Indian diaspora. Its efforts to build stronger ties with the region has also seen it embarking on new initiatives like the I2U2, which is focused on enhancing cooperation among India, Israel, UAE and the US, and also the newly launched India-Middle East Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), both of which could be called into question if the situation worsens. More than 2,000 people have already perished in the war that has resulted from Hamas' actions on October 7, designed apparently to remain relevant at a time Gulf States are normalising ties with Israel. According to Mohan Kumar, former Indian ambassador to Bahrain, the conflict is unlikely to be detrimental to India's interests in the long term."It could even reinforce and expedite cooperation among the I2U2 countries. IMEC could be affected because of its focus on infrastructure but even there the problems will not be insurmountable," said Kumar. India's condemnation of the Hamas attack is also in consonance with its overall position on terrorism and a sense of victimhood. The MEA, however, is expected to expand on India's response to the conflict on Thursday and it will be interesting to see if it further builds on the PM's remarks or just rewords those.India is seen by many as having diluted its support to the Palestinians by forging deep defence and security ties with Israel but officially it continues to back the Palestinian cause and a sovereign, independent, viable and united state of Palestine that can live in peace with Israel. In the current circumstances though, India may wait for diplomacy to kick in before it reiterates the same. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israeli discovers grandmother's tragic murder through photo posted by Hamas terrorist on Facebook

An Israeli girl named Mor Bayder witnessed her nightmare when she found that her grandmother was brutally murdered by a Hamas terrorist. The terrorist took her personal phone and snapped photos of her butchered body and posted them to her Facebook account. This is how Bayder and her family found out about her grandmother's death.Bayder's heart shattered to pieces when she logged onto Facebook to find the horrifying photos and video footage of her grandmother lying in a pool of blood."A terrorist came home to her, killed her, took her phone, filmed the horror and published it on her Facebook wall," Bayder said."My grandmother my whole world the light of my life. 
The pillar of my life, in my family's life," she wrote in a moving tribute to her grandmother.Her grandmother had lived in Nir Oz, a kibbutz in southern Israel, for all of her life before she was killed inside her home. "This morning I didn't get 'My dear teacher, did you get up?'" Bayder wrote, adding that her grandmother would consistently text her "not a minute after seven" every single morning. Bayder detailed her connection to her slain grandmother, calling her "pure and good," and said she loved to garden more than anything.The 4-day-old war has already claimed at least 1,600 lives, as Israel saw gun battles in the streets of its own towns for the first time in decades and neighborhoods in Gaza were reduced to rubble. Hamas also escalated the conflict, pledging to kill captured Israelis if strikes targeted civilians without warning.Israel's military said it had found the bodies of roughly 1,500 Hamas militants in Israeli territory as it gained effective control in the south and "restored full control" over the border. It was not immediately clear if those numbers overlapped with deaths previously reported by Palestinian authorities.Dozens of foreigners have been killed, injured or taken hostage during a surprise attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas that has left 900 people dead in Israel. Many of the missing foreigners were at an electronic music festival in the southern Israeli desert, at which scores of revellers were massacred. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israel-Hamas war: 2200 lives lost on both sides

NEW DELHI: Tensions between Israel and the Palestinians raged for a fifth day on Wednesday after Hamas launched a barbaric 'surprise attack' on Israel last weekend which killed at least 2,200 lives on both sides and left several injured.After the attack, the US moved the aircraft carrier group, USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, to the eastern Mediterranean in order to stand with Israel.What has happened so far:1. Earlier on Saturday, Hamas fired as many as 5,000 rockets into Israel after which warning sirens wailed in cities and towns across Israel as people sought refuge in bomb shelters. After this, Israel declared war on the Palestinian militant group Hamas and launched strikes in Gaza.2. After the attack, Israel also expanded its mobilization of military reservists to 360,000 and vowed to lay total siege to the Gaza Strip on Monday. In an effort to further ratchet up the pressure on Hamas, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a "complete siege" of Gaza, saying authorities would cut electricity and prevent food and fuel from entering the territory. 
He said Israel was at war with "human animals," using the kind of dehumanizing language often heard on both sides at times of soaring tensions.3. US President Joe Biden on Tuesday continued to condemn the attack by Hamas, calling it an act of "pure unadulterated evil". State Secretary Antony Blinken is traveling to Israel on an urgent mission to show support for Israel, the State Department said Tuesday. 4. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday spoke with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone and thanked him for "providing an update on the ongoing situation". "People of India stand firmly with Israel in this difficult hour."5. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has criticized Israel's blockade of Gaza, saying cutting off electricity and water is against the Palestinians' human rights.6. On Tuesday, Israel recaptured Gaza border areas from Hamas, the fourth day of fierce fighting that has left thousands dead on both sides since the militants launched a surprise attack.7. The US sent an aircraft carrier and other warships to the eastern Mediterranean as part of efforts to deter an expansion of the conflict and is also providing other assistance, including sharing intelligence with Israel.According to the Department of Defence, the USD 18 billion nuclear-powered USS Gerald R Ford deployment is not just to deter Hamas, but any country or group that may think of taking advantage of the instability and confusion to 'pursue their own ends'.The forces in the Mediterranean area include the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), with its 8 squadrons of attack and support aircraft, and the Ticonderoga class guided missile cruiser USS Normandy (CG 60), as well as the Arleigh Burke-class, guided-missile destroyers USS Thomas Hudner (DDG 116), USS Ramage (DDG 61), USS Carney (DDG 64), and USS Roosevelt (DDG 80), as per the US Central Command.Input from agencies For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: House Republican conference chair Elise Stefanik, a Harvard University alumna, has called for the resignation of Harvard's president. She made this demand on Friday due to the university's decision not to condemn or penalise students who attributed blame to Israel for the recent Hamas terrorist attacks, as New York Post reported.Stefanik, who graduated from the Ivy League university in 2006, posted on X, "Harvard continues to disgrace itself on the global stage"."Antisemitism should be condemned and never defended as 'free expression.' Claudine Gay should resign," she added to the Harvard president's third statement since Hamas launched attacks on Israel that led to the barbaric killing of over 1,300 people, including at least 27 Americans.In her statement, Claudine did not address the fact that 34 student organisations jointly signed a letter released by the Palestine Solidarity Committee. The letter held Israel "entirely responsible for all unfolding violence." 
Stefanik, along with six other members of Congress who share an alumni status with Harvard, composed a letter sent to Claudine on Friday. In this letter, they expressed their "outrage" over her failure to denounce the "dangerous antisemitism"  propagated by the organisations that supported the aforementioned letter."The Iran-backed terrorist organisation slaughtered over 1,000 people on the first day of their attack, the greatest loss of life for the Jewish community in a single day since the Holocaust," Stefanik wrote alongside Congressman Dan Crenshaw, California Representative Kevin Kiley, Representative for Florida Brian Mast, as well as Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan and Idaho Senator Mike Crapo.They told Claudine, "Any voice that excuses the slaughter of innocent women, children, and babies has chosen the side of evil and terrorism," "Harvard University must publicly condemn this statement and make it clear that it opposes violence against Israeli citizens", they added.Stefanik added in the statement, "Any voice that can defend the raping, killing, and kidnapping of innocent women and children has chosen the side of terrorism".Texas Senator Ted Cruz said, "Harvard must decide whether it wants to be a true institution of higher learning or an incubator of bigotry and anti-semitism whose students try to rationalize and justify child rape and mass murder". US representative for Florida, Brian Mast, said, "When I was at Harvard, pro-Palestine protesters harassed my family and me just because they realised I was a veteran," "There's no logic with these people - if there was, they'd realise there is no equivalency between Israelis defending themselves and terrorists beheading children. But Harvard leadership should know better", he added.In a video statement on Thursday evening, the Harvard president, while strongly condemning the "barbaric atrocities perpetrated by Hamas," emphasised that the  "university embraces a commitment to free expression."Claudine said, "Our university rejects the harassment or intimidation of individuals based on their beliefs," "That commitment extends even to views that many of us find objectionable, even outrageous. We do not punish or sanction people for expressing such views", she added.She further said, "We can fan the flames of division and hatred that are roiling the world or we can try to be a force for something different and better."Larry Summers, a former Harvard president and the former director of the Obama National Economic Council, criticised his alma mater for its delayed response to the student groups that published a letter on October 7. This letter attributed responsibility for the terrorist actions by Hamas to "the apartheid regime" of Israel.The university's Palestine Solidarity Committee's statement read, "Today's events did not occur in a vacuum". "For the last two decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison", it added.Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, along with twelve other executives, requested the identities of the students belonging to the groups that endorsed a letter pledging to "hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence". Ackman further stated that he would not consider hiring any of these students in the future.Earlier statements from Claudine's office criticised the acts of terrorism committed by Hamas but did not explicitly address the students for their endorsement of jihadist violence. Only five student groups have officially confirmed their collaboration in composing the letter. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Wolman: A lot of innocent Palestinians going to suffer

Veteran Israeli filmmaker Dan Wolman (81) was feted with the Lifetime Achievement Award in the International Film Festival of India, Goa in 2018. The globally acclaimed director talks about the Israel-Palestine war in a telephonic conversation from Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv, about 106km away from Gaza:What is your assessment of the situation?I'm not staying very close to Gaza, but Israel is a small country. Like a family, all of us are enduring the shock and agony of war. 
My wife's sister's granddaughter (aged 20 or 22) is one of those kidnapped by Hamas. Nobody knows whether she is safe or raped or tortured or killed. Similarly, a crew member of my film 'Hide and Seek' is also among those who have been kidnapped. When I talk to my friends, they have similar stories to tell.How has been the response of people?There are talks about "We should not allow Hamas to rule us, we have to bring them down. We are going to go there, bomb Hamas, do this or that." There is also a lot of anger and disappointment against the people in-charge, the prime minister, the defence minister, etc. A lot of people feel they have been betrayed by them...Actions may follow against those responsible for those lapses, after the war. But it should not be forgotten that these people, who have failed in their job, are going to lead us to war, and they may make mistakes again.Are you talking about Israeli intelligence failure?Obviously, this attack has been prepared over a year. Maybe around 5,000 people have infiltrated through air, land and water, but the intelligence was not there. I have several Muslim friends, who are good and kind hearted. I feel the brutalities unleashed by Hamas and other militants do not represent the true face of Islam. There are many Muslims and Arabs in Israel who feel ashamed by what the Hamas had done and are offering donations to Israeli soldiers, saying this does not represent the humanistic face of Islam.What do you think is the way forward?Israel is bombing Gaza and cutting supplies to the region. Many Israelis feel Hamas must be eliminated and we must take control over what is happening in Gaza. But I'm not sure this is the way. There must be another way. So, what could happen now, is not something to look forward to. A lot of innocent Palestinians are going to suffer...and it is a big tragedy. The people who had carried out the murderous operations should suffer but we are not talking about the millions of people in Gaza.Are you suggesting an international negotiation to end the conflict? Urgent international negotiations must be held to get the people who have been taken hostage by Hamas. That is the first thing to do.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

George Soros ‘funded’ groups behind pro-Hamas rallies in New York: Report

NEW DELHI: Hungarian-American business magnate George Soros since 2016 has funded more than $15 million to pro-Palestinian groups which organised protests in support of Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel at New York’s Bryant Park, reported the New York Post.According to The Post Open Society Foundations records shows “Soros’ grant-making network gave $13.7 million of the money through Tides Center, a deep-pocketed lefty advocacy group that sponsors several nonprofits who’ve justified Hamas’ bloody attacks”. The advocacy group has claimed that Palestinians were the real “victims” in the hands of the Jewish state. One of the beneficiaries of Tides Centre includes the Illinois-based Adalah Justice Project, which posted a photo on Instagram on the day Hamas attacked Israel’s southern territory. “Israeli colonizers believed they could indefinitely trap two million people in an open-air prison… no cage goes unchallenged,” the post reportedly read.Palestinian advocacy group members occupied California Representative Ro Khanna’s office on October 20 to demand he sign a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Adalah’s members also co-sponsored a rally that same day in Bryant Park where hostile demonstrators spewed antisemitic chants and waved a sign that read “I DO NOT CONDEMN HAMAS,” according to the New York Post.According to the report, Open Society Foundations, founded by Soros, also gave $30,000 in 2020 to Desis Rising Up and Moving, “another co-sponsor of the Bryant Park protest where 139 people were arrested, financial records show”.Soros’ Foundations “gave $60,000 in 2018 to the Arab American Association of New York, a group co-founded by politically connected activist Linda Sarsour that helped plan a hate-filled “Flood Brooklyn for Palestine” protest in Bay Ridge on October 21”, according to The Post. 
In the agitation protestors reportedly called for the “eradication of Israel and held a sign of the Israeli flag in a bin that read “Please keep the world clean!”Other Soros-backed, Palestinian advocacy groups whose members have been organising rallies since the massacre carried out by Hamas include “Jewish Voice for Peace and If Not Now, which received $650,000 and $400,000, respectively”.Both, according to the New York Post, “co-sponsored the Bryant Park rally, and its members were among the protestors who converged on the US Capitol complex October 18.”Jewish Voice for Peace was also involved in occupying Khanna’s office and blamed Israel for the Hamas attacks by writing on its website: “Israeli apartheid and occupation — and United States complicity in that oppression — are the source of all this violence.”The Open Society Foundations also granted $1.5 million to Adalah's parent organization, Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, with only $800,000 of the grant being disbursed before the legal centre severed its relationship with the American organization in 2018. The legal centre is dedicated to advancing human rights in Israel as its primary mission.Dan Schneider, vice president of the conservative watchdog group Media Research Center, told the New York Post that Soros - a Holocaust survivor whose loyal lieutenants have scored unmatched access to President Biden’s White House — has a long history of standing against Israel and backing groups who champion terrorists.“George Soros and his son Alex have a long history of supporting the most radical organizations across the planet, and that includes pro-Hamas organizations that support the most heinous kind of behaviour,” said Schneider, who recently co-authored a letter with MRC Founder and President Brent Bozell demanding Soros cease funding to pro-Hamas groups told New York Post. “We’ve called on George Soros to withdraw this funding, but he seems very determined to continue supporting antisemitic organisations that want to upend western civilization,” he added.

A disturbing phone recording released by the Israel Defense Force (IDF) has captured a Hamas terrorist bragging to his parents about the murder of Jews. In the chilling conversation released by the IDF, the terrorist claims to have personally killed 10 Jews and even sends photos of his victims to his parents.The incident occurred after Palestinian Hamas militants based in the Gaza Strip launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. This attack led to a declaration of war by Israel on Hamas, resulting in retaliatory bombings on Gaza. Thousands of civilians, both Palestinians and Israelis, have lost their lives since the onset of this conflict.In the phone recording, the terrorist, whose identity remains undisclosed, is heard using a phone he took from a Jewish woman he had killed in Mefalsim, a kibbutz near the Gaza border. 
Eager to showcase his heinous acts, he directs his parents to his WhatsApp messages, saying, "Look how many I killed with my own hands! Your son killed Jews!" He emphasizes his actions by repeating, "I killed 10 with my own hands! Dad, 10 with my own hands!"Shockingly, the terrorist's parents seem to applaud his actions. His father responds with, "Oh my son, God bless you!" while his mother expresses hope for his safe return. Defiantly, the terrorist states, "There is no going back. It's either death or victory," urging his parents to view the images of his victims, the New York Post reported. The content of these images and the parents' reactions to them remain unclear.The IDF presented this recording to the UN Security Council.The ongoing war between Israel and Hamas has resulted in significant casualties. According to UN reports, over 5,000 lives have been lost in Gaza since the conflict began, with women and children accounting for more than 60% of the fatalities. Additionally, over 15,000 individuals have been injured, and 212 are currently held hostage by Hamas.The international community continues to watch with bated breath as the conflict unfolds, hoping for a resolution that will bring peace to the region.

Thousands of Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip sought refuge on Saturday following Israel's warning to evacuate the area ahead of an expected ground offensive against Hamas.This came a week after the deadliest attack in Israel's history, where more than 1,300 people were killed in an incident likened to the 9/11 attacks in the United States. Israel has launched a retaliatory bombing campaign targeting Hamas, resulting in over 2,200 casualties in Gaza.The situation in Gaza, a densely populated area with 2.4 million residents, has raised concerns about the safety of Palestinian civilians. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres emphasized the need to protect civilians and prevent them from being used as shields, stating that "even wars have rules."Israeli military operationsIsrael, determined to eliminate Hamas, has deployed ground forces and tanks around Gaza, dropped evacuation leaflets in the northern region, and conducted localized raids to target terrorists and weaponry. 
The military's operations also aimed to locate missing persons, as Hamas has been holding approximately 150 hostages.The conflict has witnessed a significant number of casualties, with over 2,215 Gazans dead, including 724 children, by Saturday, according to the Palestinian health ministry.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel's campaign against Hamas was just the beginning and compared the group to the Islamic State. Israel's military operations have expanded, with forces positioned all around the Gaza Strip, raising concerns of additional combat operations.Humanitarian crisis and International effortsIn Gaza, more than 1,300 buildings have been destroyed, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the region. The situation is even more dire with the threat of a ground invasion, as Hamas has warned of potential harm to the 150 hostages it holds.International efforts to address the crisis include the US working to locate missing American citizens and an agreement between Egypt and Israel to allow US citizens to leave Gaza. Protests in support of Palestinians have erupted in various countries in the Middle East, further complicating regional politics.Regional and International implicationsThe situation has also raised the possibility of a separate confrontation in the north, with Hezbollah in Lebanon, as cross-border violence continues. A Reuters video journalist was killed, and several other reporters were wounded in southern Lebanon near Israel.The Israeli military issued evacuation orders to residents of northern Gaza, resulting in mass movement as people sought safety. Concerns were raised about the feasibility of evacuating over one million people in a single day, with the EU foreign policy chief calling it "utterly impossible."As tensions escalate, the US has provided additional munitions to Israel and dispatched its largest aircraft carrier to the region. The Biden administration has warned regional powers against involvement in the conflict.Amidst the turmoil, Saudi Arabia has paused discussions on potential normalization of ties with Israel, a move previously promoted by the US.

The United Kingdom's Chief Rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, has taken to social media to share a letter Prince William wrote him about Israel days prior to William and Kate's public statement on the ongoing Israel-Palestine crisis. "Thank you to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales for this message of solidarity with the Jewish Community and wishes for a better future for all," Mirvis captioned a photo of the letter, posted to X, formerly known as twitter."I am writing to express my solidarity in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attacks that began on Saturday," William wrote in the letter.

So many will have loved ones directly affected by this terrible violence. I want to add my voice to those who condemn the attacks unreservedly. My thoughts are with you all."Prince William reflected about his visit to Israel in 2018, during which Chief Rabbi Mirvis accompanied him. "During these challenging times, I've been contemplating my journey to the region in 2018, which left a deep impact on me," Prince William remarked. He was particularly struck by the shared aspiration of both Israelis and Palestinians for a brighter future. However, he acknowledged that given the current circumstances, "it seems unobtainable as their respective communities will be absorbed by grief, anger, and shock,"Recently, a spokesperson for William and Kate conveyed a message on their behalf regarding the tragic Hamas attack on Israel."The Prince and Princess of Wales are profoundly distressed by the devastating events that have unfolded in the past days," a spokesperson for the royal couple said. The horrors inflicted by Hamas's terrorist attack upon Israel are appalling; they utterly condemn them.""As Israel exercises its right of self defence, all Israelis and Palestinians will continue to be stalked by grief, fear and anger in the time to come.

'Nobody's hands are clean': Barack Obama on Israel-Hamas war

NEW DELHI: Former President Barack Obama has spoken on the recent Israel-Hamas conflict, emphasizing the complexity of the situation and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand. In various statements and interviews, he has urged reflection and acknowledgment of the multifaceted nature of the conflict.During an episode of the "Pod Save America" podcast, Obama described the actions of Hamas as "horrific" and stated that there is no justification for them. He also pointed out the challenges faced by Palestinians, referring to the occupation and the conditions they endure."Nobody's hands are clean, we could go on for a while," he said. 
"If you want to solve the problem, then you have to take in the whole truth," Obama said. "And you then have to admit nobody's hands are clean, that all of us are complicit to some degree."Obama admitted that he also felt guilty for the conflict, and wondered if he could have done more to prevent it when he was president. He said that he tried to push for a peace process, but faced resistance from both Israeli and Palestinian leaders, as well as domestic politics in the US.Obama criticized social media for polarizing the debate and creating a space where people only defended their own "moral innocence". He said that social media, TikTok activism and trying to debate this on that is you can't speak the truth. You can pretend to speak the truth, you can speak one side of the truth, and in some cases you can try to maintain your moral innocence, but that won't solve the problem," he said.This marks the second occasion on which former President Barack Obama has publicly addressed the conflict between Israel and Hamas, underscoring the notion of mutual responsibility. Previously, he expressed concern that Israel's countermeasures, which included restricting access to essential supplies in Gaza and resulted in civilian casualties, might be counterproductive. Obama suggested that such actions could entrench negative perceptions among Palestinians towards Israel, diminish global support for the country, and potentially hinder efforts aimed at achieving a lasting peace.

Presidential hopefuls Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley engage in heated ad battle

NEW DELHI: In the ongoing feud between Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, a super PAC supporting Florida governor Desantis has launched a new ad depicting Haley as inconsistent over aid to Palestinians in Gaza. This move follows a previous spot by a pro-Haley PAC that mocked DeSantis, reports Politico.These advertisement battles punctuate a week of escalating conflict between the GOP presidential candidates, who are drawing close in early-state polls.According to a report in Politico, Ron DeSantis, who held a steady second place behind Donald Trump for months, has faced a surge from Nikki Haley after a strong debate performance in August. She now leads DeSantis in New Hampshire and South Carolina, while he maintains an edge in Iowa.The 30-second video from Never Back Down, the PAC aligned with Ron DeSantis, highlights the difference between Haley's recent stance against providing financial aid to Gaza residents and her remarks during her confirmation hearing for the role of United Nations ambassador in 2017, Politico reported.During that hearing, when asked about supporting people living in the West Bank and Gaza, Haley responded, "I think that we need to do whatever we can to protect the region." 
The ad also quotes her saying, "Anytime that we can help mankind, regardless of where they are and what country they're in."According to Politico, the video then cuts to a recent FOX interview in which Haley states, "That is not the role of the US to do that. I've always said that," regarding aid to Palestinians.The ad will be distributed on various platforms, including YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram."Never Back Down" Chief Operating Officer, Kristin Davison, remarked, "Nikki Haley has a history of weakly flip-flopping on critical issues, and so far, she has never had to defend her actions. She's provided an opportunity with her own missteps to fully expose her record versus her rhetoric. She will not be able to survive that."According to the report, Haley's spokesperson, Olivia Perez-Cubas in a response stated, "Desperate campaigns do desperate things. Nikki was taking on Hamas and standing up for Israel at the UN, while DeSantis was a backbench Congressman voting to increase the debt and trying to ban fracking. Nikki is surging, and DeSantis is flailing."Perez-Cubas pointed out that Haley successfully pushed to cut funding to Palestinian refugees through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency during her tenure as ambassador.According to the report in Politico, the ad targeting Nikki Haley comes after the pro-Haley SFA Fund Inc. released a video challenging DeSantis' ongoing criticisms of the former South Carolina governor, calling him "losing" and "lying" and showing clips of Haley expressing her stance against accepting Gazan refugees.

NEW DELHI: Israel on Saturday claimed that Hamas posted "a video of a doll" to claim that a child was "one of the casualties" caused by the IDF (Israel Defense Force) strike on Gaza.The Jewish administration made the claim as it entered the eighth day of its bloodiest battle against Hamas.Taking to social media, the Israeli government said: "Hamas accidentally posted a video of a doll (yes a doll) suggesting that it was a part of casualties caused by an IDF attack".The Times of India cannot independently verify the authenticity of the claims.Israel has been pounding Gaza in response to the October 7 attack by Hamas fighters, who breached the security apparatus of the Jewish state and entered its southern territory, killing over 600 Israelis in a single day.Earlier, Israel ordered the evacuation of some 1.1 million people in northern Gaza, which the UN called "extremely dangerous" and "simply not possible"."We have to do more. Whatever was done is not sufficient. We need all of us to do more to stop this crime against humanity," Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour told reporters before a meeting of Arab Group ambassadors at the United Nations.Mansour has appealed to UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres to do more to stop the "crime against humanity" being perpetrated by Israel in the Gaza Strip.Gaza authorities say more than 2,200 people have been killed, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded in airstrikes by Israel over the past week.Meanwhile, a senior Egyptian official has claimed that Israel and the US have agreed to allow foreigners in Gaza to pass through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt.After Israel cut off food, power and water supply to Gaza, the Arab Group ambassadors called for a ceasefire, humanitarian aid access to Gaza and a stop to any mass displacement of Palestinians."We need to stop this war immediately. 
We need to send convoys of food and medicine to help the people there and we need to stop this ethnic cleansing from taking place," Mansour said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Internet sees 1,200% rise in antisemitic posts, NYC epicentre

NEW DELHI: It has been revealed that the number of antisemitic posts online surged by a staggering 1,200% since the onset of the Hamas terror attack in Israel on October 7. The Antisemitism Cyber Security Monitoring System uncovered alarming data, with New York City emerging as a major hub for this surge in hatred, as per New York Post report.According to the survey obtained by the Jerusalem Post, between October 7 and October 10, there were at least 157,000 posts advocating violence against Israel, Zionists, and Jews. This represents a 450% increase compared to the four days preceding the attack and a 360% increase compared to the same period the previous month.Additionally, a report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) highlighted a significant rise in extremist messages on the messaging platform Telegram. Within the first 18 hours after the Hamas attack, 347 messages called for violence against Jews, Israelis, and Zionists, marking an increase of approximately 488% from the day before.The United Kingdom also witnessed a surge in antisemitic content, with a 300% increase in the first four days of the conflict, as reported by the government's Community Security Trust.FBI Director Chris Wray expressed concern about the ongoing threat, saying that it is evolving and that foreign terrorist organizations, such as Hamas, may exploit the conflict to incite attacks within the United States. He noted that both Jewish and Muslim communities, along with their institutions and places of worship, have been threatened in recent days.The majority of the antisemitic posts identified by the Antisemitism Cyber Security Monitoring System were labeled as "New Anti-Semitism," primarily driven by anti-Israel sentiments. 
Classic antisemitism accounted for 16% of the content, while Holocaust denial posts increased by 6%, according to the survey.Paris was identified as the origin of much of the antisemitic content, particularly after an Islamist terror incident where a teacher was stabbed. However, New York City ranked second for the number of antisemitic posts, with scenes of pro-Palestinian protesters burning and stomping on the Israeli flag and even displaying a Nazi flag.Additionally, 7amleh, the Arab Center for Social Media Advancement's online monitoring group, manually identified 260 instances of hate speech targeting Muslims, while its automated analysis found 4,305 anti-Muslim posts on the platform X (formerly known as Twitter).These alarming statistics follow the Anti-Defamation League's earlier findings that antisemitic incidents in the United States reached their highest level in 2022, with nearly 3,700 reported cases. The ADL has been monitoring such incidents since 1979, relying on information provided by victims, law enforcement, local media, and community leaders.Oren Segal, vice president of ADL's Center for Extremism, emphasized the convergence of hatred seen both online and offline, describing it as a concerning development.In response to the surge in hate speech, major social media platforms have pledged to take action. Meta executives stated that they have dedicated Hebrew and Arabic speakers working round the clock to respond to hate speech in real-time. TikTok also announced an increase in resources to combat violent, hateful, and misleading content. Google, the parent company of YouTube, noted that during significant events like the Israel-Hamas conflict, it prioritizes news and information from authoritative sources while removing harmful content.In a statement, YouTube emphasized that it does not tolerate hate speech targeting any religious or ethnic communities, including Jewish and Palestinian communities, across all forms of content, including videos, livestreams, and comments. The company pledged to enforce these policies consistently across languages and regions. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Former Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal virtually addressed a rally in support of Palestinians organised by a Jamaat-e-Islami Hind-aligned outfit in Kerala's Malappuram on Friday, sparking a row. The BJP termed it an "alarming glorification of terrorists" and wondered as to how the Left-governed state allowed it. The organisers, Solidarity Youth Movement (SYM), however, said Hamas is a "resistance movement" and Meshaal a "freedom fighter".Meshaal's pre-recorded video address in Arabic was beamed on a screen at the Youth Resistance Rally, which had the tagline "Uproot Bulldozer Hindutva and Apartheid Zionism". The organisers had announced that another Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, would also virtually address the rally, but he did not.Here's what we know about the former Hamas chief*Born in the West Bank in 1956, Khaled is considered one of the founders of Hamas.*Under direct instructions from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Mossad spy agency attempted to assassinate Meshaal in 1997 while he was living in Jordan.*Mossad agents entered Jordan with forged Canadian passports and Meshaal was injected with a toxic substance, as per BBC reports.*Jordanian authorities discovered the assassination attempt and arrested two Mossad members.*The late King Hussein of Jordan asked Israel's PM for the antidote for the substance Meshaal was injected with. 
Facing pressure from then US president Bill Clinton, Netanyahu had provided the antidote after initially rejecting the request.*Hamas elected Haniyeh to succeed Meshaal as head of its political bureau in 2017, and Meshaal became head of the group's political bureau abroad.*The former Hamas chief recently called for protests in front of Israeli embassies across the world after Israel's attack on a Gaza hospital that killed hundreds of Palestinians.* Meshaal said the group has a number of Israeli soldiers, held as hostages, which are enough to negotiate releasing all the Palestinian prisoners in Israel.*Meshaal, who heads Hamas' diaspora office earlier said Hamas's Israeli captives include high-ranking officers from the Gaza Division.

Khalifa, who has consistently labeled Israel an apartheid state, took to social media to express her views, resulting in a flurry of backlash.Since the unexpected attack on Israel last Saturday, which has claimed the lives of at least 800 Israelis, Khalifa has posted a series of controversial tweets. In one of her tweets on Saturday, she wrote, "If you can look at the situation in Palestine and not be on the side of Palestinians, then you are on the wrong side of apartheid, and history will show that in Time."In another post, she referred to a photo of Hamas militant fighters as a "Renaissance painting." 
Khalifa's comments escalated further when she urged members of the militant group to "flip their phones and film" their incursion on Israel "horizontal."Khalifa also criticized reality TV star Kylie Jenner for posting a now-deleted message in support of Israel on her Instagram account. She wrote, "If true journalism exists, the next person to talk to Kylie Jenner will ask for her opinion on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and not break eye contact until she can string one coherent sentence together since she wants to take a stance to her 400M followers so badly."Since Saturday, Khalifa has been reposting numerous statements from various sources in defense of the war to her 5 million followers. One of these statements, originally from influencer Kelbin, described the attacks as "what oppressed fighting the oppressor looks like."Mia Khalifa, who was banned from her home country of Lebanon, gained rapid but not particularly lucrative fame in the adult industry back in 2014. She also made headlines for claiming to have received ISIS death threats in 2018 over a scene she filmed wearing a hijab. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: The violence unleashed by the Hamas-Israel conflict has claimed at least 1,600 lives so far as the war has entered its fourth day.Israel saw gun battles in the streets of its own towns for the first time in decades and neighborhoods in Gaza were reduced to rubble. Hamas also escalated the conflict, pledging to kill captured Israelis if strikes targeted civilians without warning.The war has prompted international declarations of support for Israel after a devastating weekend attack by Hamas, and appeals for an end to the fighting and protection of civilians.Here are the top developments on the Hamas-Israel conflict:Israel retakes control of Gaza fence Israel has retaken control of the Gaza border fence breached by Palestinian Hamas gunmen who carried out a weekend mass-incursion, and is planting mines in the parts where the barrier was toppled, the chief military spokesperson said on Tuesday.In remarks aired by Israel's Army Radio, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said there had been no new infiltrations from Gaza since Monday. In an apparent response to rumours that gunmen used cross-border tunnels, he said the military had no such findings.1,500 bodies of Hamas militants found in IsraelIsrael's military said about 1,500 bodies of Hamas militants were found in Israeli territory as, as it said it had largely gained control in the country's south and "restored full control" over the border on the fourth day of fighting following an unprecedented surprise attack.Spokesperson Richard Hecht said no Hamas fighters have crossed into Israel since last night, although infiltrations could still be possible. 
Israel has previously reported 900 soldiers and civilians killed, and Palestinian authorities have reported about 700 deaths in Gaza and the West Bank.Israel mobilizes 3 lakh reservistsIsraeli warplanes pounded downtown Gaza City, home to Hamas' centers of government, with relentless bombardments into early Tuesday, after Israel's prime minister vowed retaliation against the Islamic militant group that would "reverberate for generations."Israel said that Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza are holding more than 150 soldiers and civilians snatched from inside Israel after the attack caught its vaunted military and intelligence apparatus completely off guard.As the Israeli military activated 300,000 reservists in a massive mobilization, a major question was whether it will launch a ground assault into the tiny Mediterranean coastal territory. The last ground assault was in 2014.Hamas threatens to kill captives if Israel strikes civiliansThe Islamist militant Hamas movement threatened to execute an Israeli captive every time Israel bombs a Palestinian home without warning.The violence, which has claimed more than 1,500 lives, prompted international declarations of support for Israel after a devastating weekend attack by Hamas, and appeals for an end to the fighting and protection of civilians.Security tightened around Israel embassy, Chabad HouseThe Delhi Police has beefed up security around the Israeli embassy and Chabad House here in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict, an official said.The local police stationed around the embassy in New Delhi and Chabad House, located in Chandni Chowk in central Delhi, has been directed to maintain a tight vigil, he said on Tuesday.The officer added that authorities have directed to increase the vigil around both the installations.US, France, Germany, Italy, UK will help Israel 'defend itself'The leaders of the United States, France, Germany, Italy and Britain pledged in a joint statement Monday to "support Israel in its efforts to defend itself" after the surprise attacks by militant group Hamas.They added that they "recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people" but said Hamas "offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed," in the statement released by the White House.Airlines halt flights in and out of IsraelMajor airlines have suspended flights in and out of Israel after the nation declared war following a massive attack by Hamas.Scores of arriving and departing flights at Ben Gurion were cancelled or delayed, according to the airport's online flight board, which also showed a steady trickle of flights.

Israel takes responsibility for Gaza ambulance attack

NEW DELHI: Israel has acknowledged its involvement in an attack on an ambulance outside Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical facility in the area. Witnesses report that the incident resulted in casualties, with numerous people being killed and injured, reported CNN.According to the Hamas-run health authorities, at least 15 people were reported killed and 50 others wounded in the incident. Footage from the scene depicted numerous bloodied casualties scattered near an ambulance, and there were visible signs of shrapnel damage to at least one of the cars on the scene.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that they targeted the ambulance because it was allegedly being used by a Hamas terrorist cell near their position in the battle zone.The statement read as, “A number of Hamas terrorist operatives were killed in the strike. We have information which demonstrates that Hamas’ method of operation is to transfer terror operatives and weapons in ambulances.”UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated his appeal for a ceasefire in Gaza following the ambulance strike, despite Israel's rejection of such calls. 
In a statement, Guterres said, “I am horrified by the reported attack in Gaza on an ambulance convoy outside Al Shifa hospital. The images of bodies strewn on the street outside the hospital are harrowing,” he said, adding: “I do not forget the terror attacks committed in Israel by Hamas and the killing, maiming and abductions, including of women and children. All hostages held in Gaza must be released immediately and unconditionally.”Guterres also highlighted the month-long suffering of Gaza's civilian population, particularly children and women, who have faced a siege, lack of aid, casualties, and displacement from their homes, and called for an end to these hardships.A spokesperson for the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, present at Al-Shifa Hospital, blamed the attack on Israel.The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) confirmed that one of its ambulances was part of the convoy but thankfully none of its team members sustained injuries in the strike. However, the ambulance suffered damage when a shell landed nearby, according to PRCS. The organization further reported that, upon reaching the gate of Al-Shifa Hospital, the gate itself came under attack once more. They added that a separate Ministry of Health ambulance was directly hit, resulting in numerous casualties among the civilians in the vicinity.Dr. Ashraf Al-Qidra said that the authorities had organized the medical convoy departing from the hospital and had notified the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) about this undertaking.He explained that the convoy was en-route to the Rafah Crossing, a vital escape route for Gazans amidst the ongoing bombardment along the strip. Al-Qidra said that the Israeli occupation forces deliberately targeted the ambulances in various locations, including at the entrance of the Al-Shifa medical compound.The ICRC verified to CNN that it had received a request to accompany the convoy before its departure. However, it clarified in a subsequent statement that it was not directly involved in the convoy. Despite this, the ICRC emphasized that any act of violence against medical personnel is unacceptable, underscoring that medical professionals should never be subjected to harm while dedicated to saving lives.“No doctors, nurses, or any medical professionals should ever die while working to save lives”, said the ICRC.The Israeli claim that Al-Shifa Hospital is a significant Hamas command and control center has been rejected by Palestinians and Hamas. The Director General of the Gaza Health Ministry, Dr Medhat Abbas, told CNN that Gaza's hospitals are solely used for patient care and not for hiding anyone. Hamas has also denied the claim and has called for international intervention to halt the bombing and destruction of the medical system. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

George Soros ‘funded’ groups behind pro-Hamas rallies in New York: Report

NEW DELHI: Hungarian-American business magnate George Soros since 2016 has funded more than $15 million to pro-Palestinian groups which organised protests in support of Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel at New York’s Bryant Park, reported the New York Post.According to The Post Open Society Foundations records shows “Soros’ grant-making network gave $13.7 million of the money through Tides Center, a deep-pocketed lefty advocacy group that sponsors several nonprofits who’ve justified Hamas’ bloody attacks”. The advocacy group has claimed that Palestinians were the real “victims” in the hands of the Jewish state. One of the beneficiaries of Tides Centre includes the Illinois-based Adalah Justice Project, which posted a photo on Instagram on the day Hamas attacked Israel’s southern territory. “Israeli colonizers believed they could indefinitely trap two million people in an open-air prison… no cage goes unchallenged,” the post reportedly read.Palestinian advocacy group members occupied California Representative Ro Khanna’s office on October 20 to demand he sign a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Adalah’s members also co-sponsored a rally that same day in Bryant Park where hostile demonstrators spewed antisemitic chants and waved a sign that read “I DO NOT CONDEMN HAMAS,” according to the New York Post.According to the report, Open Society Foundations, founded by Soros, also gave $30,000 in 2020 to Desis Rising Up and Moving, “another co-sponsor of the Bryant Park protest where 139 people were arrested, financial records show”.Soros’ Foundations “gave $60,000 in 2018 to the Arab American Association of New York, a group co-founded by politically connected activist Linda Sarsour that helped plan a hate-filled “Flood Brooklyn for Palestine” protest in Bay Ridge on October 21”, according to The Post. 
In the agitation protestors reportedly called for the “eradication of Israel and held a sign of the Israeli flag in a bin that read “Please keep the world clean!”Other Soros-backed, Palestinian advocacy groups whose members have been organising rallies since the massacre carried out by Hamas include “Jewish Voice for Peace and If Not Now, which received $650,000 and $400,000, respectively”.Both, according to the New York Post, “co-sponsored the Bryant Park rally, and its members were among the protestors who converged on the US Capitol complex October 18.”Jewish Voice for Peace was also involved in occupying Khanna’s office and blamed Israel for the Hamas attacks by writing on its website: “Israeli apartheid and occupation — and United States complicity in that oppression — are the source of all this violence.”The Open Society Foundations also granted $1.5 million to Adalah's parent organization, Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, with only $800,000 of the grant being disbursed before the legal centre severed its relationship with the American organization in 2018. The legal centre is dedicated to advancing human rights in Israel as its primary mission.Dan Schneider, vice president of the conservative watchdog group Media Research Center, told the New York Post that Soros - a Holocaust survivor whose loyal lieutenants have scored unmatched access to President Biden’s White House — has a long history of standing against Israel and backing groups who champion terrorists.“George Soros and his son Alex have a long history of supporting the most radical organizations across the planet, and that includes pro-Hamas organizations that support the most heinous kind of behaviour,” said Schneider, who recently co-authored a letter with MRC Founder and President Brent Bozell demanding Soros cease funding to pro-Hamas groups told New York Post. “We’ve called on George Soros to withdraw this funding, but he seems very determined to continue supporting antisemitic organisations that want to upend western civilization,” he added.

NYT writer quits after accusing Israel of ‘genocide’

NEW DELHI: A New York Times writer opted to sign out from the company after violating newsroom policy by signing an open letter accusing Israel of 'genocide' against Palestinians. Jazmine Hughes, a staff writer for New York Times Magazine, resigned from her position on Friday, as per The New York Post. Regarding her resignation, magazine editor Jake Silverstein said, “While I respect that she has strong convictions, this was a clear violation of The Times’s policy on public protest." 
She further stated that this policy is an important part of employees' commitment to independence.“She and I discussed that her desire to stake out this kind of public position and join in public protests isn’t compatible with being a journalist at The Times, and we both came to the conclusion that she should resign,” Silverstein continued.Earlier this week Hughes signed a letter from “Writers Against the War on Gaza” which openly blamed Israel for the deaths of their own people in an October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas, which left roughly 1,400 dead.It seems that the Israel-Gaza war has imposed some restrictions on the freedom of expression. The war has forced many institutions to contend with members who feel strongly about the conflict, which involves a long history of Israeli occupation and deadly military reprisals on Palestinian territory, as per The Washington Post. “We stand with their anticolonial struggle for freedom and for self-determination, and with their right to resist occupation,” the letter read, in an endorsement of Hamas barbarism.According to the New York Post, the letter publicly blasted the New York Times Editorial Board for defending Israel’s right to “defend … a society that values human life and the rule of law.”We condemn those in our industries who continue to enable apartheid and genocide. We cannot write a free Palestine into existence, but together we must do all we possibly can to reject narratives that soothe Western complicity in ethnic cleansing,” the letter read, spouting additional Pro-Hamas talking points.The writer, Hughes, has won a string of accolades while working as a writer and editor at the Times, including a National Magazine Award in March for profiles on Viola Davis and Whoopi Goldberg. Forbes named her one of its top “30 under 30” journalists several years earlier, in part for her work to help diversify her newsroom.She was prominently involved in criticizing her newspaper’s op-ed desk in 2020 after it published a column by Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) urging the military to enter US cities. reported The Washington Post.

Kerala blast, Hamas & Gaza — all in a day’s talk by Vijayvargiya

Indore: BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has on Tuesday accused the Congress of playing appeasement politics by “spreading videos of violence in Gaza in minority areas”.
“Congress is 100% indulging in appeasement politics. A Muslim worker told me that Congress is distributing videos of atrocities on Palestine and Hamas in Muslim areas saying, look what PM Narendra Modi is getting done,” Vijayvargiya said at a press conference.
“The Congress has been showing its love to terrorists from the start and now is showing it again. It is not a surprise. When the G20 countries under PM Modi’s leadership passed the Delhi Declaration, the Congress supported terrorist group,” alleged Vijayvargiya.
“The incident of Kerala is before us. The Hamas commander in a virtual address threatened Hindus. We are not going to be frightened by this threat,” Vijayvargiya said, adding: “The BJP’s policy is nationalist. PM Modi’s policy is national policy, and the people of the country are with him on the Israel-Palestine issue.”
Congress media coordinator KK Mishra countered by saying: “Kailash Vijayvargiya has forgotten that an office bearer of a BJP MP was arrested for supplying confidential information to Pakistani agency ISI. And which party gave the ticket to MCOCA accused Pragya Thakur? Isn’t she an accused in a terror act?”
On Congress’s promise of caste census, Vijayvargiya said, “The Congress has been banking on divide and rule since the beginning. It never thought of the country's benefit.”
Mishra pointed out that Congress has decided to give representation on share of population. “BJP itself works on divide-and-rule policy to win elections,” he countered, and reiterated that the Congress will carry out a case census after it forms the government in MP. Vijayvargiya refuted the opposition’s allegation that the Union government is tapping their phones. “It is not easy to tap a phone. It is not easy these days. Nobody can tap a phone. If anybody does phone tapping illegally, he will get punished,” he said.
On the rebellion in BJP in Malwa-Nimar area, Vijayvargiya said, “I have talked with almost everybody. Discussion with all rebels in Dhar is done and they will withdraw their nominations. The rebel from Shajapur is out here. There is no major issue.”

PM Narendra Modi talks to Jordan King, calls for early resolution of Gaza conflict

NEW DELHI: In another sign of India's evolving position on the Israel-Hamas war, PM Narendra Modi called for concerted efforts for "early resolution of the security and humanitarian situation'' in a conversation with Jordan's King Abdullah II, the third West Asian leader he has spoken to since the October 7 terror attack by Hamas on Israel and the latter's retributive bombing of Gaza.The assertion by Modi after the talks, in which he also underlined India's concerns over terrorism, is significant as it's the closest that India has come to calling for a ceasefire and came a day after India despatched aid for civilians in Gaza. The US had last week vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called for "humanitarian pauses'' in the conflict but the EU on Monday indicated it might back such a pause to facilitate distribution of aid in Gaza.Jordan, which signed a peace deal with Israel in 1994, is an important stakeholder in the Israel-Palestine conflict as it shares border with the West Bank and Palestinians make up a significant number of its population. It's also the official custodian of the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, a perennial flashpoint in the conflict.While Modi called for an early resolution, a Jordanian readout said the two leaders discussed means to stop the deteriorating situation in Gaza and also covered the need to step up international efforts to end the "war on Gaza, protect civilians and hospitals, and guarantee the sustained delivery of medical and relief aid into the strip''.The King, who called off a summit with President Joe Biden last week after Israel was accused of bombing a hospital in Gaza, also warned of the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and the repercussions of what is happening in the Gaza strip on the region and the world.In his remarks on X, Modi said he had exchanged views on the developments in the West Asia region. 
"We share concerns regarding terrorism, violence and loss of civilian lives. Concerted efforts needed for early resolution of the security and humanitarian situation,'' he said.India's first reaction to the conflict, in the form of remarks by Modi again on X, had the government condemning the Hamas assault as terrorist strikes. Modi reiterated the same in his conversation with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and also raised concerns over terrorism in his talks with Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas. As concerns grew over relentless bombing of Gaza by Israel, India balanced its position by expressing concerns over civilian casualties, seeking adherence to international humanitarian law and reiterating its longstanding support for a two-state solution.

NEW DELHI:  On Friday, Grand Central Terminal in New York City was shut down due to a protest by hundreds advocating for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, as confirmed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).Initially, access to the station was limited. However, as the protest grew, the MTA decided to close the terminal. The MTA announced on its website, "Grand Central Terminal is closed until further notice due to a protest," advising travelers to consider other stations and anticipate additional travel time, the Reuters reported on Friday.The demonstrators, many of whom wore black shirts with the message “Jews say cease fire now,” filled the expansive concourse of the station, voicing their demands with chants such as “no more weapons. 
No more war. Ceasefire is what we’re fighting for.” Some protesters took their message to elevated positions, climbing the ticket counters and displaying large banners with statements like “Palestinians should be FREE” and “Never again for anyone.”Additionally, banners were dropped from the terminal’s staircases, accompanied by chants of “Mourn for the dead and fight like hell for the living.”Inside the terminal, a banner prominently displayed the message, "Mourn the dead, and fight like hell for the living."Social media captured the scene, with images of demonstrators exiting the train station and assembling on 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan. Numerous participants were seen being held by the police.The protest was orchestrated by the Jewish Voice for Peace. They shared a video on Instagram that depicted officers inside the terminal guiding a lengthy procession of protesters. These individuals wore shirts emblazoned with "Cease Fire Now" and "Not In Our Name," and had their hands restrained behind them.The group emphasized the scale of the event in their post, stating, "HUNDREDS OF JEWS AND ALLIES ARE GETTING ARRESTED IN WHAT IS LIKELY THE BIGGEST MASS CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE NYC HAS SEEN IN TWO DECADES."On the same day, Israel expanded its aerial and ground offensives in the Gaza Strip. In response, Hamas, the governing Palestinian militant group in Gaza, declared its readiness to meet the Israeli actions with "full force." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Cryptocurrency stolen from Delhi lands in Hamas wallets

NEW DELHI: In the winter of 2021, Delhi Police's Special Cell was investigating a case of cryptocurrency theft of around Rs 4 crore from the wallet of a west Delhi businessman. Though the cops managed to 'deep trace' a few recipient wallet IDs, tracking the end users appeared difficult. Just at the time, Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, communicated - as part of routine intelligence exchange with their Indian counterparts - information about some suspect wallets operated by terrorist groups for terror funding.Many of the wallet addresses on the list were being operated by the al Qassam brigades of Hamas, the Palestinian terror group, and had been 'seized' by Israel's National Bureau for Counter Terror FinancingA breakthrough arrived when the Special Cell's Intelligence Fusion & Strategic Ops (IFSO) unit ran a match on the wallets: several wallets that had received the Bitcoin and Ethereum assets from Delhi were operated by the cyber terrorism wing of Hamas.While Israel has hit back strongly at Hamas for Saturday's attack, sources said the intelligence agencies have their antennae up about renewed efforts by the terror outfit to collect funds by hacking in pro-Israel countries.Even on Tuesday, the cyber unit of Israel Police froze a large number of cryptocurrency accounts held by Hamas for fundraising. 
Israel Police said on X (formerly Twitter) that Hamas had launched a crypto fundraising campaign after the start of the latest terror attacks. Israeli authorities also urged crypto exchange Binance to transfer the seized funds to that country's state treasury.The case in Delhi was the first instance of Hamas' activity in India. Special Cell officers said that the probe details were communicated to the relevant authorities at the time. Former DCP (Special Cell) KPS Malhotra's team had investigated the case. "Yes, our investigation had led us to several wallets linked to the al Qassam brigades," Malhotra confirmed on Tuesday.The matter, cops said, was first reported in 2019 at Paschim Vihar police station and the investigation was later transferred to the Special Cell on court orders, cops privy to the investigation recalled. After the Hamas link was unearthed, technical analysis revealed that one of the seized wallets belonged to Naseer Ibrahim Abdulla in Gaza and to Hamas operatives like Ahmed Marzooq in Giza and Ahmed QH Safi in Ramallah in Palestine. "The cryptocurrencies were routed through various private wallets and finally landed in these suspected wallets," a police officer revealed. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Congress not condemning Hamas is appeasement politics: BJP

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday accused Congress and its alliance partners of fighting shy of condemning the killing of innocent and unarmed Israeli civilians, saying the reluctance of opposition parties was reflective of their obsession with "politics of appeasement"."Congress at it again. Supporting terror organisations and terrorism while innocent civilians lose their lives to bullets," Union minister Pralhad Joshi said in a post on X a day after the Congress Working Committee, in its resolution, omitted mention of the terrorist attack by Hamas."With this stand, the leading party of INDI Alliance has exposed itself to the nation. How will the party protect its nation and citizens when it is openly standing with violence?"
 Joshi added a day after Left student unions in the campus of Aligarh Muslim University, JNU and Jamia Milia demonstrated in support of Palestinians.Rajya Sabha MP and BJP's chief spokesperson Anil Baluni said Congress's politics of appeasement was on full display at the cost of basic human sensitivities. "Though Congress coined Hindu terror, we believe that terror has no religion. But for the CWC to ignore the killing of innocent civilians and to focus only on the demands of the Palestinians speaks of a mindset which places electoral considerations over basic human values," Baluni said.The statements came against the backdrop of an array of politicians - National Conference's Omar Abdullah, PDP's Mehbooba Mufti and AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi - supporting the Palestinian cause, in sharp contrast to PM Modi's unequivocal condemnation of the killings by Hamas as a 'terrorist attack".The gap between the positions can potentially create a new faultline during the campaign for assembly polls. The day Israel was attacked, BJP on its social media handles floated the "Never forgive, never forget" hashtag, saying, "What Israel is facing today, India suffered between 2004-14." The reference was to the spate of terror attacks under UPA governments and BJP's charge that they were facilitated by a government that was weak, lacked willpower and practised votebank politics.Sharing a clip of the movie 'A Wednesday' based on terror attacks in the country, the party said, "If cinema is a reflection of the times we live in, this film from the UPA era is a grim reminder of how terrorist attacks had become routine in India between 2004-14. Our collective memories of those horrendous times may have become feeble. But never forgive, never forget."With all indications suggesting that West Asia is headed for a prolonged period of conflict, the political fight over terrorism can well intensify.

Israel-Hamas war: Biden faces GOP criticism over handling of Middle East crisis

The recent Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and the subsequent large-scale retaliation by Jerusalem have placed President Joe Biden in the midst of a Middle East crisis, reported AP. This situation poses the risk of escalating into a broader conflict and has left the President defending his administration's policies against criticism from GOP presidential contenders. They argue that his decisions contributed to the current situation.The potential for extended and intensifying violence could challenge Biden's leadership on the global stage and domestically. He must navigate the delicate balance between showing unwavering support for Israel while fostering a more comprehensive peace in the volatile Middle East. 
Sympathetic militant groups quickly praised Hamas's actions, resulting in hundreds of casualties on both sides. The U.S. is also trying to determine if any Americans were among the casualties or captives.Lebanon's Hezbollah group welcomed the attack, citing it as a response to "Israeli crimes." This Iran-backed group, which shares similar objectives with Hamas regarding the destruction of Israel, launched rockets and shells at Israeli positions, drawing a response from Israel's military, including the use of armed drones. An adviser to Iran's supreme leader commended Hamas's operation, which declared its readiness for a prolonged conflict.Several Republican contenders for the 2024 presidential race wasted no time in attempting to assign blame to Biden. They sought to connect his recent decision to release $6 billion in blocked Iranian funds, part of a prisoner swap that freed five Americans detained in Iran, to the complex attack on Israel. The White House vehemently rejected these claims, clarifying that the unfrozen funds can only be used for humanitarian purposes and have not been spent by Iran.Iran has historically maintained strong ties with both Palestinian Hamas and Hezbollah. Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged Iran's support for Hamas over the years but emphasized that there was no evidence linking Iran to this specific attack.Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and condemned the attacks, pledging support for Israel's defense needs. He also warned against using the attacks for political advantage.This attack complicates ongoing disputes between the Biden administration and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program. The administration aims to revive a deal that eased sanctions on Iran in return for nuclear program restrictions, a deal abandoned by the Trump administration.Additionally, the Biden administration has been working on normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a potentially transformative development in the region. However, this new conflict adds a significant obstacle to these efforts, as Saudi Arabia has stated it won't officially recognize Israel until the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is resolved.Some Republicans blamed Biden for the Hamas attack, with former President Donald Trump criticizing the perception of U.S. weakness under Biden. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Senator Tim Scott also pointed fingers at Biden's policies, including the release of frozen Iranian funds.Blinken refuted these claims, emphasizing that the funds released were for humanitarian purposes and not for supporting terrorism. He expressed disappointment that some were playing politics amidst a situation where lives were at stake and Israel was under attack.Regarding concerns that funds for Palestinian civilians might have indirectly supported the operation, administration officials denied this, stating that their efforts aimed to assist civilians and did not involve funds that Hamas could use. They also conveyed warnings to Iran that direct involvement in the Gaza situation would jeopardize future initiatives the U.S. might consider with Iran. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

She wrote, "If true journalism exists, the next person to talk to Kylie Jenner will ask for her opinion on geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and not break eye contact until she can string one coherent sentence together since she wants to take a stance to her 400M followers so badly."Since Saturday, Khalifa has been reposting numerous statements from various sources in defense of the war to her 5 million followers. One of these statements, originally from influencer Kelbin, described the attacks as "what oppressed fighting the oppressor looks like."Mia Khalifa, who was banned from her home country of Lebanon, gained rapid but not particularly lucrative fame in the adult industry back in 2014. She also made headlines for claiming to have received ISIS death threats in 2018 over a scene she filmed wearing a hijab. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Internet and phone services collapsed in the Gaza Strip under intensified bombardment Friday night, largely cutting off its 2.3 million people from the outside world and each other, as Israel's military said it was "expanding" its ground operations in the besieged territory. The military's announcement signalled it was moving closer to an all-out invasion of Gaza, where it has vowed to crush the ruling Hamas group after its bloody incursion in southern Israel three weeks agoFrequent explosions from airstrikes lit up the sky over Gaza City after nightfall Friday, when the black-out in internet, cellular and landline services hit. The Red Crescent said it lost all contact with its operations room and medical teams. 
It said it feared people would no longer be able to contact ambulance services. Other aid groups said they were unable to reach staff on the ground. The Palestine Telecommunications Company, Paltel, announced "a complete disruption of all communication and internet services" due to bombardment.Israeli military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said ground forces were "expanding their activity" in Gaza and that it "is acting with great force ... to achieve the objectives of the war." Earlier in the day, defence minister Yoav Gallant told a small group of foreign reporters that Israel expects a long and difficult ground offensive into Gaza soon. It "will take a long time" to dismantle Hamas' vast network of tunnels, he said, adding that he expected a lengthy phase of lower-intensity fighting as Israel destroys "pockets of resistance." His comments pointed to a potentially grueling and open-ended new phase of the war after three weeks of relentless bombardment.Earlier Friday, the military said ground forces backed by fighter jets and drones raided inside Gaza, striking dozens of militant targets over the past 24 hours. It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in Shijaiyah, a neighborhood on Gaza City's outskirts. This was Israel's second ground raid into Gaza in as many days. Meanwhile, the Russian newspaper Kommersant quoted a member of a Hamas delegation visiting Moscow as saying time was needed to locate all those who had been abducted by various Palestinian factions in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7. "They seized dozens of people, most of them civilians, and we need time to find them in the Gaza Strip and then release them," Abu Hamid said. He said Hamas, which has freed four hostages so far, had made clear it intended to release "civilian prisoners". But this required a "calm environment", he said, repeating an assertion that bombings had already killed 50 of those held.Late Friday, the army released photos showing what it claimed were Hamas installations in and around Gaza's largest hospital, al-Shifa. Senior Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq called the Israeli reports on al-Shifa "lies" to pave the way for strikes on the hospital. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Natasha Dach, a former employee of Apple, was fired by the tech giant for posting a controversial and hateful message about Jewish people on her Instagram account. In her post, which was shared by a pro-Israel watchdog group called StopAntisemitism, Dach claimed to be "a proud German" and accused Jews of being "murderers and thieves" who "sneak into countries, steal people's lives, jobs, homes, streets, push them, bully them, torture them". She also called Jews "terrorists" and said that history would note their crimes.Dach's post was widely condemned by social media users, who tagged Apple and its CEO Tim Cook, and demanded action against her. Some also questioned her loyalty to the US and her sympathy for Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that is designated as a terrorist organization by the US and many other countries.Dach, who worked as a technical specialist and manager apprentice at Apple, according to her now-deleted LinkedIn profile, deleted her Instagram and LinkedIn accounts after receiving backlash for her remarks. 
She was also removed from Apple's official employee directory. StopAntisemitism later tweeted that she "is no longer an employee at Apple".Liora Rez, the executive director of StopAntisemitism, told The New York Post that they learned of Dach's termination from a confidential source within Apple. She also said that Dach's post was "horrifying" and "one of the worst cases of antisemitism" they had seen.Apple has not commented publicly on Dach's case, but the company has a policy of zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment in its workplace. According to its website, Apple "is committed to creating and maintaining a work environment where all employees are treated with dignity and respect" and "does not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, age, or any other basis protected by law".Dach's case is not the first time that an Apple employee has been fired for posting offensive content on social media. In 2019, Antonio Garca Martnez, a former product manager at Apple, was fired after his past misogynistic and racist tweets resurfaced online. Martnez had also written a controversial book called Chaos Monkeys, in which he described his experience working at Facebook and Silicon Valley.Dach's case also highlights the issue of antisemitism and hate speech on social media, which has increased in recent years, especially in the context of the Israel-Palestine conflict.Social media platforms, such as X, formerly Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, have faced criticism and pressure for not doing enough to combat antisemitism and hate speech on their platforms. They have also been accused of applying inconsistent or biased standards when moderating such content. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Miami dentist fired for removing Israeli hostages' posters

NEW DELHI: A dentist was fired after he was caught on camera tearing down posters of Israeli hostages, which had been displayed in the trendy Brickell neighborhood of Miami, reported the New York Post.Dr Ahmed ElKoussa claimed that his actions were intended to prevent racially charged hatred in the city. The incident quickly gained attention when viral footage of him and a friend tearing down the posters circulated on social media.The posters featured images of roughly 200 people kidnapped by Hamas, the Palestinian militant organization. While Dr ElKoussa's intentions were reportedly to prevent potential conflicts and violence in his local community, his actions faced widespread criticism.The dental office where Dr ElKoussa worked, CG Smile, issued a statement expressing their disapproval of his actions and clarifying that they do not support terrorist groups, their actions, or their supporters. 
Consequently, Dr ElKoussa was removed from the staff, and all affiliations with him on the dental office's social media pages and groups were severed.Dr ElKoussa's representative and lead attorney at Muslim Legal, Hassan Shibly, told the Post, "His personal opinion was that posters from either side may potentially incite conflict and he did not want there to be any conflict escalation in his local community. And he was concerned that those posters could potentially trigger conflict - rightfully or wrongfully, he was concerned that they would trigger and escalate conflict."The dentist's actions are said to be influenced by a recent incident involving a 71-year-old landlord who fatally stabbed a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, and injured his mother.Upon contacting the police with his concerns about the flyers, Dr ElKoussa was advised to either put up counter-posters or remove the existing ones. He chose to remove the posters, but his actions sparked outrage and even led to death threats and harassment, ironically contributing to the conflict he sought to avoid.Hassan Shibly emphasized that Dr. ElKoussa's intention was never to harm anyone, and he had acted based on an analysis he made on the spot, deeply affected by the stabbing of the 6-year-old child. Dr ElKoussa has since apologized for any harm his actions may have caused to the Jewish community and intends to seek to regain his job, claiming that he was wrongfully terminated.Dr ElKoussa's social media accounts have been taken down, and his dental practice's Yelp page has been flooded with negative reviews.

Israel's military announced on Monday that it had regained control of southern areas near the Gaza Strip after three days of intense clashes with Hamas fighters, reported . The surprise attack by Hamas, which Israel has likened to the shocking events of 9/11, left the nation in a state of grief and disbelief.According to military spokesman Daniel Hagari, Israel now holds control over the affected communities, although he cautioned that individual Palestinian "terrorists" might still be present in the region. Israel had mobilized tens of thousands of troops and heavy armor in the area in an effort to dislodge the remaining Hamas fighters.In response to the attack, Israel launched a barrage of strikes on Gaza, resulting in a tragic death toll of 493 people, as reported by Palestinian officials. The situation in Gaza has escalated, with plumes of smoke darkening the skies, fighter jets roaring overhead, and ongoing rocket fire from Hamas, reaching as far as Jerusalem.Amidst the chaos, Palestinians in Gaza are bracing for the possibility of an Israeli ground attack aimed at defeating Hamas and liberating hostages. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has issued a stern warning to Gaza civilians to stay away from all Hamas sites, pledging to reduce them "to rubble."The Middle East has witnessed a surge in tensions as Iran and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, have praised the Hamas attack. 
However, Tehran has denied any involvement in the ongoing military operation.Hamas, for its part, has called on "resistance fighters" in the occupied West Bank and in Arab and Islamic nations to join its "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood," a campaign launched half a century after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.In a show of support, the United States has pledged "rock solid" backing for Israel, committing to sending munitions and military hardware to its key ally and diverting an aircraft carrier group to the eastern Mediterranean.Israel, known for its high-tech military and intelligence capabilities, has been deeply shaken by the unprecedented attack by Hamas, which included ground, air, and sea incursions. Israel now faces the potential of a multi-front war, with Hezbollah launching missiles and artillery shells from the north in a display of solidarity with Hamas.The breach of the border fence by over 1,000 militants who infiltrated nearby Jewish communities took Israel by surprise. These gunmen went on a rampage, going house to house, abducting citizens, and leaving devastation in their wake. Among the hostages taken back into Gaza were children and even a Holocaust survivor in a wheelchair.The scale of the attack has shocked Israelis, with many expressing anger at the intelligence failure that allowed such a breach to occur. However, the nation has set aside its recent political divisions and is preparing for what Netanyahu has warned will be a "long and difficult war."Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus described the multi-pronged attack as "by far the worst day in Israeli history," drawing a grim parallel to the combined impact of the 9/11 and Pearl Harbor attacks.Retaliatory air and drone strikes continue to target Gaza, with over 500 Hamas and Islamic Jihad targets struck, according to the Israeli Defense Forces.Inside Gaza, the situation is dire, with air strikes causing significant damage to residential areas. Over 120,000 people in Gaza have been displaced, according to the United Nations, leading to unbearable psychological and economic conditions for the residents.The conflict has sent shock waves globally, with fears of further escalation. The surge in oil prices and condemnations from Western capitals have underscored the gravity of the situation. Foreign or dual nationals from various countries have been reported killed, abducted, or missing in the war, further highlighting the international ramifications of the conflict.In a tragic incident, a police officer in the Egyptian city of Alexandria opened fire "at random" on Israeli tourists, resulting in the deaths of two Israelis and their Egyptian guide. Israel has issued travel warnings for its citizens, especially in the Middle East, as the situation continues to unfold. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Surge in anti-Israel protests across US sparks fear of destabilization

In the wake of Israel's conflict with Hamas in October, a wave of protests has swept major American cities and college campuses, drawing attention to an alarming trend of anti-Israel sentiment, reported Fox News. Rather than condemning Hamas, the focus of these demonstrations has shifted to criticizing the Jewish state. Particularly troubling instances have been observed on American college campuses, including prestigious institutions like Harvard and New York University.The movement has not been confined to campuses alone; it has reached the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington, D.C., where clashes between supposed pro-Palestinian demonstrators and the police turned violent. 
Additional protests unfolded outside the State Department, featuring handmade signs with anti-Israel slogans like "Israel = Cancer of the Middle East."Experts, offering perspectives to Fox News Digital, see these protests as part of a broader issue aimed at destabilizing the country. Human rights attorney Brooke Goldstein calls for a thorough investigation into the organization of these protests, suggesting potential connections to foreign governments or terrorist organizations.Analysts attribute the complexity of these protests to the influence of left-wing academics who have long supported divisive ideologies. Christopher F. Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, notes the overlap between rhetoric targeting Jews and similar language used against "whiteness." Lisa Daftari, editor-in-chief of The Foreign Desk, highlights the intersectionality of social justice movements, linking support for left-wing ideas with the condemnation of Israel.The rise in antisemitism is seen as a result of the cross-sectionality of social justice movements, encouraging young people to demonize Israel in alignment with their support for various human rights causes. The protests are viewed as an attempt to portray Israel as a country of white privilege, despite its diverse population.The protests also raise concerns about potential connections to terrorist groups, with some experts suggesting that protesters are not pro-Palestinian but rather pro-Hamas. The ongoing geopolitical complexities are further complicated by the use of antisemitic sentiments in various movements, including Black Lives Matter (BLM) chapters expressing support for Hamas.While the protests continue, concerns grow over their potential impact on the stability of the United States. The intersections of various social justice movements, divisive academic ideologies, and geopolitical complexities contribute to a challenging landscape that experts argue needs careful examination and investigation by law enforcement officials.

At least 60 mosques 'destroyed' in Israel's Gaza airstrikes, highest in years: Report

NEW DELHI: Amid the meetings for cessation of the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and efforts to restore peace in Gaza, a Palestinian news agency has reported that at least 60 mosques have been destroyed across the strip since the outbreak of the war.News agency Wafa reported that most of the mosques, including the al-Salam Mosque in the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City, were desecrated in the Israeli airstrikes.Israel began pounding the strip in retaliation to the terror attack unleashed by Hamas terrorists on its southern territory on October 7.According to the Wafa news agency report, the demolition of al-Salam Mosque has now brought the total count of religious buildings destroyed by the Israeli Forces in strife-torn Gaza to 60. This marks an unprecedented level of destruction of religious structures in the region as a result of the ongoing rivalry between the two sides.The unprecedented destruction of religious sites took place despite the cultural properties, and the houses of worship having protection under international humanitarian law.As the death toll continues to climb in Gaza, the United States and the European Union have raised concerns and accused Hamas of "using civilians as human shields".Israeli forces reached the gates of Gaza City's main hospital on Monday, the primary target in their battle to seize control of the northern half of the Gaza Strip, where medics said patients including newborn babies were dying for lack of fuel.There was also fresh concern that the war could spread beyond Gaza, with an upsurge of clashes on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, and the United States launching air strikes on Iran-linked militia targets in neighbouring Syria.More than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. 
About 2,700 people have been reported missing.Meanwhile, 1,200 people have been killed on the Israeli side, mostly in the initial Hamas attack. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

SRINAGAR: The J&K administration barred Friday namaz at Srinagar's historic Jamia Masjid and confined Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq to his residence amid speculation that the authorities were trying to pre-empt a post-prayer protest against Israel's crackdown on Hamas in Palestine.Anjuman Auqaf Jama Masjid, which manages Kashmir's largest mosque, issued a statement expressing "surprise and deep regret" at the administration's action. It said security officials forced shut all doors to the shrine in the morning and announced without explanation that no congregation would be allowed for the day.The mosque committee also claimed that the Mirwaiz had been put under house arrest, weeks after being released from four years of detention in his Srinagar home. 
Till late Friday, there was no official word on whether the separatist leader had been detained again or only stopped from stepping out for prayers.The Mirwaiz, 14th in a line of Kashmir's most influential Islamic clerics, had been allowed to offer namaz at the Jamia Masjid in front of a large gathering of followers on September 22.Friday's action coincided with the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre in Jordan again including the Mirwaiz in its list of "500 most influential Muslim personalities" for 2024."He has been advocating dialogue with both India and Pakistan so that the aspirations of the Kashmiri people may be realised," states the organisation, which calls itself an independent research entity affiliated to the Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought headquartered in the Jordanian capital of Amman.

NEW DELHI: Hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman has strongly objected the pro-Palestinian student protests in Columbia University and has also vowed to stop donating to the university.According to a report in the New York Post, in a recent interview, the Polish-Jewish descent, Cooperman slammed students protesting the Jewish state as having “s–t for brains.”“We have one reliable ally in the Middle East — that’s Israel. We only have one democracy in the Middle East — that’s Israel, okay? And we have one economy tolerant of different people — gays, lesbians, etc. And that’s Israel,” the 80-year-old chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors, a New York-based investment firm with over $3.3 billion in assets, continued.“So I have no idea what these young kids are doing," he added.Cooperman further said that he would stop donating to his alma mater unless he notices any change from the administration, which has till now refused to condemn a tenured professors comments on Hamas terror attacks against Israel as 'awesome,' the New York Post reported.The billionaire was referring to comments made by politics and history professor Joseph Massad, who called Hamas’ attacks on Israel a “stunning victory” in an article he published on The Electronic Intifada a day after the conflict ignited.According to the report, Cooperman also advised the university administrators to "fire this professor."Cooperman told in the interview that he has donated almost 50 million dollars to Columbia University, but now he is thinking about diverting the money some other philanthropic works.According to the report, almost 60,000 people signed a petition created by a student which accused the university's of 'condoning and supporting terrorism,' and demanding the professor's termination.The petition firmly states, "Irrespective of one's perspective on the conflict, endorsing and celebrating one of the most heinous acts of terrorism in history is never justifiable."In response, a letter of support for Professor Massad condemned the petition and called upon Columbia University President Nemat Shafik to provide unwavering assurances for his personal safety and academic freedom. 
This letter garnered signatures from thousands of individuals, including alumni, staff, and students of the university.According to the New York Post, Columbia University has refrained from offering comments on the matter when contacted by The Post. However, several professors have voiced their opinions, among them, Israeli-American assistant professor Shai Davidai. He alleged that Columbia's President, Minouche Shafik, has not addressed the concerns raised by student groups. In a YouTube video titled "an open letter to every parent in America," he expressed reservations about allowing his daughter to attend the Ivy League institution."The View" host Meghan McCain also conveyed her feelings of shame regarding her association with Columbia University in New York City. She pointed to what she described as a significant presence of antisemitism on campus. Meghan McCain firmly stated her decision not to contribute financially or engage in speaking events with the university. She stressed that such virulent antisemitism and a professor's expression of feeling 'invigorated' by terror attacks are unacceptable within the academic sphere.Furthermore, on a recent occasion, university administrators canceled a student group's on-campus movie night after the group indicated that "Zionists" were not welcome. A Columbia University spokesperson reiterated the institution's stance, emphasizing, "As we have reiterated many times over the past few weeks, antisemitism or any other form of hatred will not be tolerated in our community."

Israel-Hamas war: Biden faces GOP criticism over handling of Middle East crisis

The recent Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and the subsequent large-scale retaliation by Jerusalem have placed President Joe Biden in the midst of a Middle East crisis, reported AP. This situation poses the risk of escalating into a broader conflict and has left the President defending his administration's policies against criticism from GOP presidential contenders. They argue that his decisions contributed to the current situation.The potential for extended and intensifying violence could challenge Biden's leadership on the global stage and domestically. He must navigate the delicate balance between showing unwavering support for Israel while fostering a more comprehensive peace in the volatile Middle East. 
Sympathetic militant groups quickly praised Hamas's actions, resulting in hundreds of casualties on both sides. The U.S. is also trying to determine if any Americans were among the casualties or captives.Lebanon's Hezbollah group welcomed the attack, citing it as a response to "Israeli crimes." This Iran-backed group, which shares similar objectives with Hamas regarding the destruction of Israel, launched rockets and shells at Israeli positions, drawing a response from Israel's military, including the use of armed drones. An adviser to Iran's supreme leader commended Hamas's operation, which declared its readiness for a prolonged conflict.Several Republican contenders for the 2024 presidential race wasted no time in attempting to assign blame to Biden. They sought to connect his recent decision to release $6 billion in blocked Iranian funds, part of a prisoner swap that freed five Americans detained in Iran, to the complex attack on Israel. The White House vehemently rejected these claims, clarifying that the unfrozen funds can only be used for humanitarian purposes and have not been spent by Iran.Iran has historically maintained strong ties with both Palestinian Hamas and Hezbollah. Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged Iran's support for Hamas over the years but emphasized that there was no evidence linking Iran to this specific attack.Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and condemned the attacks, pledging support for Israel's defense needs. He also warned against using the attacks for political advantage.This attack complicates ongoing disputes between the Biden administration and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program. The administration aims to revive a deal that eased sanctions on Iran in return for nuclear program restrictions, a deal abandoned by the Trump administration.Additionally, the Biden administration has been working on normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a potentially transformative development in the region. However, this new conflict adds a significant obstacle to these efforts, as Saudi Arabia has stated it won't officially recognize Israel until the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is resolved.Some Republicans blamed Biden for the Hamas attack, with former President Donald Trump criticizing the perception of U.S. weakness under Biden. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Senator Tim Scott also pointed fingers at Biden's policies, including the release of frozen Iranian funds.Blinken refuted these claims, emphasizing that the funds released were for humanitarian purposes and not for supporting terrorism. He expressed disappointment that some were playing politics amidst a situation where lives were at stake and Israel was under attack.Regarding concerns that funds for Palestinian civilians might have indirectly supported the operation, administration officials denied this, stating that their efforts aimed to assist civilians and did not involve funds that Hamas could use. They also conveyed warnings to Iran that direct involvement in the Gaza situation would jeopardize future initiatives the U.S. might consider with Iran. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar spoke to his Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen on Saturday and reiterated India’s condemnation of terrorism and its support for a two-state solution. He also underlined the importance India attaches to international humanitarian law, as Israel continues its punitive action against Hamas in Gaza.Amid the deteriorating security situation in Gaza and continued loss of civilian lives, India has also stepped up its engagements with stakeholders who are working to defuse the situation. 
PM Narendra Modi had on Friday spoken to his UK counterpart Rishi Sunak and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan about the Israel-Hamas conflict.A UK readout of the Modi-Sunak conversation said the leaders discussed the “deeply distressing situation” in the Middle East and condemned Hamas’s attacks on Israel. India has so far not named Hamas in its condemnation of the October 7 terror attacks on Israel.According to Sunak’s office, the leaders also reiterated that Hamas did not represent the Palestinian people and reflected on the need to de-escalate tensions in the wider region.After his talks with his Israeli counterpart, Jaishankar said he appreciated Cohen’s sharing of the Israeli assessment of the current situation. “Reiterated our firm commitment to countering terrorism, observance of international humanitarian law and for a two-state solution,” said Jaishankar.Cohen thanked him for his support of Israel and of its war against the Hamasterrorist organization.“Our war is the entire democratic world’s war against a despicable terrorist organization that is worst than ISIS,” said Cohen on social media platform X.

NEW DELHI: Hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman has strongly objected the pro-Palestinian student protests in Columbia University and has also vowed to stop donating to the university.According to a report in the New York Post, in a recent interview, the Polish-Jewish descent, Cooperman slammed students protesting the Jewish state as having “s–t for brains.”“We have one reliable ally in the Middle East — that’s Israel. We only have one democracy in the Middle East — that’s Israel, okay? And we have one economy tolerant of different people — gays, lesbians, etc. And that’s Israel,” the 80-year-old chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors, a New York-based investment firm with over $3.3 billion in assets, continued.“So I have no idea what these young kids are doing," he added.Cooperman further said that he would stop donating to his alma mater unless he notices any change from the administration, which has till now refused to condemn a tenured professors comments on Hamas terror attacks against Israel as 'awesome,' the New York Post reported.The billionaire was referring to comments made by politics and history professor Joseph Massad, who called Hamas’ attacks on Israel a “stunning victory” in an article he published on The Electronic Intifada a day after the conflict ignited.According to the report, Cooperman also advised the university administrators to "fire this professor."Cooperman told in the interview that he has donated almost 50 million dollars to Columbia University, but now he is thinking about diverting the money some other philanthropic works.According to the report, almost 60,000 people signed a petition created by a student which accused the university's of 'condoning and supporting terrorism,' and demanding the professor's termination.The petition firmly states, "Irrespective of one's perspective on the conflict, endorsing and celebrating one of the most heinous acts of terrorism in history is never justifiable."In response, a letter of support for Professor Massad condemned the petition and called upon Columbia University President Nemat Shafik to provide unwavering assurances for his personal safety and academic freedom. 
This letter garnered signatures from thousands of individuals, including alumni, staff, and students of the university.According to the New York Post, Columbia University has refrained from offering comments on the matter when contacted by The Post. However, several professors have voiced their opinions, among them, Israeli-American assistant professor Shai Davidai. He alleged that Columbia's President, Minouche Shafik, has not addressed the concerns raised by student groups. In a YouTube video titled "an open letter to every parent in America," he expressed reservations about allowing his daughter to attend the Ivy League institution."The View" host Meghan McCain also conveyed her feelings of shame regarding her association with Columbia University in New York City. She pointed to what she described as a significant presence of antisemitism on campus. Meghan McCain firmly stated her decision not to contribute financially or engage in speaking events with the university. She stressed that such virulent antisemitism and a professor's expression of feeling 'invigorated' by terror attacks are unacceptable within the academic sphere.Furthermore, on a recent occasion, university administrators canceled a student group's on-campus movie night after the group indicated that "Zionists" were not welcome. A Columbia University spokesperson reiterated the institution's stance, emphasizing, "As we have reiterated many times over the past few weeks, antisemitism or any other form of hatred will not be tolerated in our community."

Evangelicals in Iowa prioritize support for Israel ahead of Republican caucuses

In the midst of the aftermath of the recent Hamas attack on Israel, which resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties, evangelical Christian pastors in Iowa are emphasizing the significance of supporting Israel, both from a biblical and political perspective, reported AP. In the lead-up to the first-in-the-nation Republican presidential caucuses, these pastors are urging their congregations to prioritize candidates who align with their pro-Israel stance.Steve Rowland, one of the pastors at the Rising Sun Church of Christ in Altoona, issued a strong call to action, saying, "What we're seeing in that region is pure evil. Israel has mobilized their army and they are intent on stamping out evil, and we should be behind them. 
That's where we should be, and I want you to know that, as a pastor."Support for Israel has surged as a top priority for evangelicals in the upcoming Republican caucuses, signaling a shift from the longstanding emphasis on curbing abortion. Some Christians believe in Israel's historical and religious significance due to Old Testament writings that consider Jews as God's chosen people and Israel as their rightful homeland. Additionally, some evangelicals view Israel as a crucial element in end-times prophecies leading to the return of the Christian messiah.Since the October 7 attack by Hamas, Iowa's evangelical community has been closely scrutinizing candidates' positions on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Several Republican contenders have criticized President Joe Biden for not taking a tougher stance on Hamas and Iran, which has a history of supporting the group financially and militarily.Former President Donald Trump, a dominant figure in Iowa's political landscape, has a significant following among Christian conservatives. However, some were rankled by his criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the Hamas attack and his remarks about Hezbollah.The report also highlights the complex intersection of conservative priorities, including immigration, with support for Israel. Trump and other Republicans have suggested a link between Hamas sympathizers and unauthorized border crossings, despite limited evidence of such incidents. The debate surrounding the acceptance of Palestinian refugees in the United States further underscores the multifaceted nature of this issue.The report also delves into how various Republican candidates position themselves on Israel. South Carolina Senator Tim Scott references the Bible in emphasizing Israel's importance, while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis seeks to win the support of evangelical clergy despite questions about Trump's stance on Israel.

In a compelling narrative documented by The New York Times, Tasneem Ismael Ahel, a 19-year-old college student in Gaza City, has emerged as a voice in the midst of war, using WhatsApp voice notes to offer a glimpse into the challenging realities of life in the conflict-ridden region. As Israel imposed a communications blackout and cut off electricity, Tasneem's heartfelt audio messages, often arriving in bursts, shed light on the daily challenges faced by Palestinians living under siege.A segment from her voice messages reads, "We just want to sleep and we can’t. We can’t because we don’t know where and what and when they will bomb missiles. So I record these voice [messages]. And I know maybe it’s not my last voice. 
Maybe it’s my last voice. Maybe it will reach you, maybe it doesn’t".For two weeks in mid-October, Tasneem embarked on a brave journey, creating an audio diary that she shared with The New York Times. Her account offers a rare glimpse into the intersection of ordinary life with the horrors of war. She documented her sister's somber birthday, the scarcity of essential supplies, the loss of a friend, and the desperate search for shelter during airstrikes.This round of fighting, which began in response to a Hamas-led attack in Israel, has subjected Tasneem and Gaza's residents, many of whom are under the age of 18, to an unprecedented number of deadly airstrikes. Over 6,500 Palestinians have tragically lost their lives.For Tasneem, this is not her first experience with war; it's her fifth. Born and raised under siege, her dreams have always reached beyond the concrete borders of Gaza. She aspires to study dentistry abroad and simultaneously pursue her passion for writing, painting, and singing.While describing life under siege she sends a voice note which reads, "It’s 14 October. 11 a.m. I am feeling like I am dead already. But I am still breathing, just still breathing. I miss my old life. I used to be a clean, tidy girl. And everything here is not. I used to be having everything normal. I just want to live normal. I just want to shower normally. I just want to use bathroom normally. I can’t breathe normally here. Everything is getting worse".While her dreams may seem distant amid the repeated conflicts that devastate her homeland, Tasneem's resilience shines through. She and her family have chosen to remain in the land of their ancestors, despite the dangers. As Gaza City transforms into a ghost town with widespread evacuations, they have decided to stay, even as the war looms ever closer.With determination and hope, Tasneem's voice rises above the devastation, delivering a message that transcends the confines of conflict.

On November 1, 2023, a group of Columbia University students staged a walkout during a joint lecture held by former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Keren Yarhi-Milo, the dean of Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. The lecture was part of a course on women’s involvement in peace processes, which Clinton co-teaches with Yarhi-Milo. The students who walked out were protesting what they perceived as the school’s role in publicly shaming students who had signed a statement saying that “the Israeli extremist government” shared responsibility for the October 7 attack by Hamas.The statement, which was published on October 10 by the Columbia University Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), condemned the Hamas rocket attack that killed four Israeli civilians, but also blamed Israel for its “ongoing occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing” of Palestinians. 
The statement was signed by more than 100 students from various academic programs and student organizations at Columbia.On October 25, a right-wing group called Stop Antisemitism Now rented a billboard truck that circled around the Columbia campus, displaying the names and photographs of some of the signatories of the SJP statement, along with the label “Columbia’s Leading Antisemites”. The group also posted the same information on its website and social media platforms, accusing the students of supporting terrorism and inciting violence against Jews.The students who signed the SJP statement said they felt harassed, intimidated, and unsafe by the billboard campaign, and demanded that the university take action to protect them and their privacy. They also criticized the university for not issuing a public statement in support of their freedom of speech and academic expression.The walkout during Clinton’s lecture was organized by some of the signatories of the SJP statement, along with other student activists who supported their cause. They said they wanted to draw attention to their plight and to challenge Clinton’s role as a co-teacher of the course, given her history of supporting Israel and opposing the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.Clinton did not comment on the walkout during the lecture, but later issued a statement saying that she respected the students’ right to express their opinions, but disagreed with their views on Israel and Hamas. She also said that she hoped to engage in a constructive dialogue with them in the future.The walkout sparked a heated debate on campus and online, with some people praising the students for their courage and solidarity, and others condemning them for their disrespect and antisemitism.

How the 'octopus' became a symbol of anti-semitism and landed Greta Thunberg in trouble

NEW DELHI: Climate activist Greta Thunberg has deleted a pro-Palestine social media post after critics claimed a stuffed blue octopus visible in the photo could be viewed as an 'anti-Semitic' symbol. In a social media post, the 20-year-old wrote: "Today we are striking in solidarity with Palestine and Gaza. The world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected."'Was not aware'While many criticised her for failing to condemn Hamas attacks on Israel, others questioned why the image of her with three other activists featured a blue octopus, branding it an 'anti-Semitic trope'.Moments later, Thunberg deleted it and shared a nearly identical photo - the same four people holding the same four signs - this time with the stuffed animal cut out of the photo."It has come to my knowledge that the stuffed animal shown in my earlier post can be interpreted as a symbol for anti-Semitism, which I was completely unaware of," she wrote in an accompanying post. 
"The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people as a way to communicate feelings."Why an octopus is considered an anti-semitic symbolSymbols and imagery used in anti-Semitic propaganda and rhetoric during the late 19th and early 20th century often used octopus imagery as a part of broader conspiracy theories. Such propaganda used an octopus to represent perceived Jewish influence, suggesting that Jewish people are controlling or manipulating various aspects of society or politics. Many posters depicted the tentacles of an octopus, wearing a Star of David over its head, encompassing a globe.This trope often manifested itself as both writings and graphic imagery that sought to accuse Jews of trying to control the world for nefarious means. One of the most infamous examples of the octopus as an anti-Semitic symbol can be found in the political cartoons of the early 20th century. Nazi propagandaThese cartoons, particularly those published in publications like 'Der Strmer,' a Nazi propaganda newspaper, depicted Jews as tentacled octopuses with their arms extending to control various aspects of society, such as finance, media, and politics. These images portrayed Jews as secretive and manipulative, playing into harmful stereotypes that have fueled anti-Semitism for centuries.The octopus symbolism in anti-Semitic propaganda plays into a broader conspiracy theory known as "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion". This fictitious text, first published in Russia in the early 20th century, claimed to reveal a Jewish conspiracy for world domination. In these fabricated protocols, Jews were portrayed as a secret and all-powerful group controlling global affairs through their tentacles of influence. The use of the octopus in anti-Semitic propaganda is an extension of this conspiracy theory and reinforces the notion that Jewish people are responsible for various societal problems.Furthermore, the octopus as an anti-Semitic symbol is not limited to historical propaganda. It has also appeared in more recent forms of hate speech, including online imagery and memes. These modern uses continue to promote harmful stereotypes and can further contribute to the perpetuation of anti-Semitic beliefs. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Stanford University has taken swift action to suspend a lecturer following allegations of inappropriate conduct within the classroom. The lecturer, who remains unidentified, is accused of making Jewish students feel uncomfortable and targeted during a recent class on colonialism, reports the New York PostThe incident unfolded during two freshman classes, where the lecturer allegedly opened the discussion by focusing on colonialism. According to reports, the lecturer went on to make statements that deeply troubled some students, particularly those of Jewish heritage, based on statements given by Stanford's Israeli Student Association to the San Francisco Chronicle. 
It is said that the lecturer blamed the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas on "Zionists," which refers to those who support an independent Jewish state.The lecturer's comments reportedly included justifying the actions of Hamas terrorists and downplaying the Holocaust, a historical tragedy that took the lives of millions of Jewish people. During one class session, Jewish students were asked to identify themselves, separated from their belongings, and instructed to stand in a corner, supposedly as an illustration of what the lecturer claimed Jews were doing to Palestinians.Nourya Cohen, one of the co-presidents of Stanford's Israeli Student Association, recounted the unsettling classroom experience,saying that the lecturer even questioned the number of Jewish lives lost during the Holocaust, quoting, "Yes, only 6 million". After a student had quoted the number.Rabbi Dov Greenberg, the director of the Chabad Stanford Jewish Center, also spoke with concerned students. According to him, the lecturer categorized students as "colonizers" or "colonized" based on their ancestry, which left many feeling uncomfortable, especially those with Israeli backgrounds who were labeled as "colonizers."Furthermore, the lecturer allegedly defended the actions of Hamas, referring to them as "freedom fighters" and asserting that they were a legitimate representation of the Palestinian people.In the aftermath of the incident, students reportedly felt traumatized and reluctant to voice their concerns in the classroom. Nourya Cohen expressed feeling dehumanized and likened the experience to the justifications used by Nazis during the Holocaust.Stanford University's president, Richard Saller, and provost, Jenny Martinez, responded to the allegations by suspending the lecturer and initiating an internal investigation. They stressed that academic freedom should not be used to target students based on their backgrounds and identities. It's important to note that the lecturer in question was described as a teaching assistant and not a member of the faculty.In their statement, Saller and Martinez condemned all forms of terrorism and mass atrocities, including Hamas's attacks on Israeli civilians, characterizing them as a "moral matter."

NEW DELHI:  The Israeli army is intensifying its operations in Gaza, causing significant displacement of million civilians in the region. The Israel Defence Forces also said that it had attacked Hamas’s vast network of tunnels, which are a key objective for the military, as reported by the Telegraph.Here are the five key developments of the war on day 25:Israeli troop deployment in Gaza Over 20,000 Israeli troops have entered Gaza since the ground offensive began, as per reports.Two Israeli sources told Axios that the Israeli army has deployed more than 20,000 troops, including two armored and infantry divisions, into the Gaza Strip since Friday night.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his war cabinet on Monday that Israel was making “systematic progress” in its military campaign against Hamas.Netanyahu also said that the Israeli army has “expanded its ground entry into the Gaza Strip, it is doing it in measured, very powerful steps, making systematic progress one step at a time”.UN reports displacement of Gaza population to SouthHalf of Gaza's population, approximately one million people, have been pushed southwards in the past three weeks due to the ongoing conflict, the head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees said.Philippe Lazzarini said in a UN emergency meeting “I have said many times, and I will say it again: no place is safe in Gaza,”Israeli military leaders have told the civilians to relocate to the southern area of Wadi Gaza for safety. 
However, tens of thousands are still in the northern region, which has faced the most intense bombing. It's uncertain how much time remains for a safe evacuation with Israeli troops and armor advancing on the ground.Israeli operations inside tunnel networkIsrael has said it has conducted operations targeting Hamas gunmen within their extensive tunnel network beneath Gaza. These tunnels are a key focus for the Israeli military as they expand their ground presence to wipe out the Hamas movement.“Over the last day, combined IDF combat forces struck approximately 300 targets, including anti-tank missile and rocket launch posts below shafts, as well as military compounds inside underground tunnels belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation,” the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said.Hamas terrorists reportedly responded with anti-tank missiles and machine gun fire, it added.Medical supplies running low, Doctors in moral trauma Doctors in Gaza are facing severe shortages of essential medical supplies. This scarcity gives them a “moral trauma" by making it a difficult decision about which patient to save, the head of a medical group has said..Dr Zaher Sahloul told the BBC World Service that his team were running out of anaesthesia, pain medication, blood products, antibiotics, gauze and many other items that are needed to stop the bleeding and treat patients in trauma.“On top of that you have the bombing and limited, or shortage of, clean water, food, diesel and fuel,” he said.“So that means you have to make a decision as a doctor which patients you need to focus on, and maybe treat and save lives, and which patient you need to let go,” He added.Child casualties reach 420 in Gaza everyday, says UnicefThe UN children's agency Unicef, reported that over 420 children are being killed or injured in Gaza daily. Catherine Russell, the executive director of Unicef, said the figure “should shake each of us to our core”.According to figures from the Palestinian health ministry,over 8,300 individuals have lost their lives in Gaza since October 7. Russell noted that this number includes at least 3,400 children.“Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen,” he said.(With input from agencies) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on Monday shared satellite images showing how Israel looked before and after the unprecedented terror attacks by the Islamist militant group Hamas on October 7.While posting the satellite images on X, showing the widespread destruction caused by the surprise attack, the IDF said, "The lengths Hamas is willing to go in order to commit war crimes are visible even from outer space."Meanwhile, Israel has activated a plan to evacuate residents of 28 villages within 2 km (1 mile) of the Lebanese border, the military said on Monday following hostilities with Hezbollah in parallel to the spiralling war in Gaza.An Egyptian-controlled border crossing into Gaza is expected to reopen amid diplomatic efforts to get aid into the enclave that has been under intense Israeli bombing since the rampage by the militant group Hamas killed 1,300 people.Shocked by the assault on towns and villages, Israel is carrying out the most intense bombardment Gaza has seen, has imposed a strict blockade, and is preparing a ground invasion.The death toll from Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip surged to at least 2,670 since Hamas's bloody attack. Another 9,600 people have also been injured as Israel continued its blistering air campaign on targets in the Palestinian coastal enclave, the Hamas-controlled ministry added.

NEW DELHI: Applauding India's world cup win over Pakistan, Israel ambassador to India Naor Gilon said on X he's happy Pakistan was unable to achieve a victory that it would have attributed to Hamas terrorists."We are happy that India emerged victorious in the India versus Pakistan match at CWC23 and that Pakistan was unable to attribute its victory to the terrorists of Hamas," said Gilon. "We were really moved by Indian friends showing their solidarity with Israel by displaying posters during the match," he added. The Israel embassy has also thanked India for its condemnation of the Hamas terror attack on Israel. "For me, it's the point of optimism. It's very emotional. The level of support that we got, from the PM, on the same day on Saturday when the whole picture was not clear. Among the first leaders, who came out and tweeted very clear condemnation. We will never forget that," Gilon had earlier said.India has since qualified its position on the issue by underscoring its support for international humanitarian law as Israel prepares for a ground invasion of Gaza and also reiterated its long held policy advocating resumption of direct negotiations towards establishing a sovereign, independent and viable Palestine state living within secure and recognised borders, side by side at peace with Israel.

Why Israel war may be bad news for telecom companies' 5G plans

The ongoing Israel-Palestine war may be bad news for telecom companies looking to expand their 5G footprint. As a potential escalation of Israel's war with Palestinian militant group Hamas could reportedly push up costs of imported 5G network gear. According to a report in the Economic Times, the cost may escalate by as much as Rs 2,000-2,500 crore initially and slow down roll outs of next-gen networks by India's top telcos, say industry executives, bankers and analysts.This, the report says, is as a wider, long-drawn conflict could initially trigger around a 3-4% dip in the rupee versus the US dollar. 
This may lead to an increase in telcos' foreign debt servicing costs and impact profitability in coming quarters as a sizable chunk of the $7 billion-plus telecom sector debt is dollar-denominated, the people cited added.Rise in dollar value may hurt telecom companies"The Israel-Hamas war has not yet caused an alarming fall in the rupee vs the US dollar, but if it escalates and becomes a wider global conflict, there could be some currency volatility with the rupee potentially falling around 3-4% vs the US dollar, which would make telcos' 5G network gear imports costlier as around two-thirds of equipment used in domestic networks is still imported," Rohan Dhamija, head (India & Middle East) at Analysys Mason, told ET.Top bankers told the publication that the military conflict posed fresh headwinds for the domestic currency as global risk aversion had already increased safe-haven demand for the US dollar and weakened appetite for emerging market currencies such as the rupee. They, though, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been regularly intervening in the currency market through dollar sales from its reserves to curb excessive volatility."If I look at current price volatility, as long as it continues, the range can be capped at 83.30/$1 on the upside because that is kind of a ceiling which the RBI has defined. But if globally things were to take a turn for the worse and if USD/INR takes off, it (the rupee's exchange rate) could even expand to 84.50/$1," said Anindya Banerjee, vice president for currency derivatives at Kotak Securities.Nearly 67% of telecom gear used in local phone networks is imported primarily from foreign vendors such as Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung, which is why big telcos such as Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi) are estimated to collectively splurge around $7 billion (over ?58,000 crore) annually on imported networks.

UPenn under fire over antisemitism allegations, donations halted

NEW DELHI: Former US Ambassador Jon Huntsman has criticized the University of Pennsylvania's response to recent incidents of antisemitism on its campus and pledged to halt his family's donations to the prestigious institution. Huntsman, an alumnus of UPenn and a former trustee, has been a significant contributor to the university, with the Huntsman name adorning the main Wharton School building, reported CNN.The controversy began when UPenn hosted the Palestine Writes Literature Festival, which included speakers with a history of making antisemitic remarks. While UPenn leaders issued a statement condemning antisemitism broadly, they did not specifically denounce the festival. 
This drew strong backlash from powerful donors like private equity billionaire Marc Rowan, who argued that the university's response was insufficient.The situation escalated further in the wake of Hamas's attack on Israel, prompting more donors to criticize UPenn's handling of antisemitism. UPenn President Liz Magill issued a statement acknowledging that the university did not handle the situation as effectively as it could have.However, Jon Huntsman remained unsatisfied, accusing UPenn of remaining silent in the face of reprehensible acts by Hamas against Israel. He argued that silence equates to antisemitism and hate, which goes against the core principles of higher education.In a letter to Magill which was initially reported by The Daily Pennsylvanian, later obtained by CNN, Huntsman stated that the Huntsman Foundation would cease all future donations to UPenn, something that had been a source of pride for three generations of graduates. He criticized UPenn for being "deeply adrift" and accused its leadership of embracing "moral relativism."The backlash against UPenn's handling of antisemitism also led to the resignation of trustee Vahan Gureghian, who expressed disappointment in the university's failure to stand against antisemitism and to prioritize students' well-being.President Magill has since tried to address the situation and conceded that the response to the Palestine Writes Literature Festival was inadequate. She recognized the pain it caused to the Jewish community, particularly during the holiest time of the Jewish year, and emphasized that the university does not endorse the speakers or their views.Magill also unequivocally condemned Hamas's terrorist assault on Israel and its violent actions against civilians, emphasizing that there is no justification for such heinous attacks. She announced increased security measures and support for Jewish centers on and near the campus to ensure the safety of the community.UPenn's board of trustees, led by Scott Bok, expressed unanimous support for President Magill and her existing leadership team, asserting that they are the right group to lead the university through this challenging situation, after having virtual discussions in the past few days.

NEW DELHI: When news broke that Israel had declared war in the Gaza Strip after an unprecedented attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas a week ago, there was tension at Narendra Pal Singh's house in Etah, a small town in Uttar Pradesh. Worried about the safety of their daughter, Sonal Pal, who is pursuing her postdoctoral studies in Israel, the family has spent sleepless nights in the last few days. On Wednesday, when Singh learnt that his daughter would be among the first 212 Indians to be repatriated from Israel under Operation Ajay, the family heaved a sigh of relief.On Friday, Singh and his brother reached Terminal 3 at Indira Gandhi International Airport at 4.30am. At around 6am, the special flight landed and the father and daughter ran into each other's arms."We couldn't stop watching the news and called Sonal almost every hour to check on her. 
Now that I have her in front of me, my worries are over," smiled Singh. A relieved Sonal said, "Amidst all the uncertainty in Israel, I hadn't imagined that I would meet my family so soon."The moment when the first group of Indian evacuees, mostly students in Tel Aviv, touched down on home soil on Friday morning, there was high emotion in the air. Tired smiles, warm embraces and long-awaited hugs marked the atmosphere at IGI airport. In conversations with TOI, many passengers recalled their last few days in Israel, hiding in bomb shelters amid the constant wail of sirens and the loud sounds of missile interceptors.Harsh Pallav of UP's Gorakhpur recalled the Saturday night when the Hamas rockets hit Israel. He woke up to the eerie tone of the missile siren. "I initially thought I was dreaming. But it was a harrowing reality that forced us into the shelters for several days," said the 24-year-old MS student in electronics. "What was unfolding before my eyes were like the scenes I'd only seen in movies."The pervasive fear that hung over their lives is what postdoctoral researcher Nipun, 24, from Pratapgarh in UP, remembers. "While the south-central region where I lived wasn't directly impacted by the violence, the fear of terrorist infiltration was constant," said Nipun.The evacuees shared their experiences of rushing to basements and bunkers whene ver the sirens blared. Paushali Mukherjee, 28, of Kolkata recalled, "I remember having to cook my meals in shifts. Every time I began preparing food, the siren inevitably went off, sending me rushing for shelter." The evacuees spent many nights hungry and sleepless.Lucknow native Pankaj, 37, and his wife Sikha, 35, both postdoctoral researchers, returned with their five-monthold son, Pranil. They claimed they hadn't slept for two days. "After the conflict started, our anxiety went up by the minute," said Sikha. "All we wanted to do was make sure that we got back to our country safely with our son. As soon as we were told that we were getting a flight to India, we didn't wait for a single minute but packed whatever we felt was important and travelled around 200km to reach Tel Aviv to board the flight. We were glad that public transport and the internet were operating in most areas."They have returned home safe, but there now is uncerta inty among most of the evacuees about their educational future. Postdoctoral students Sriman Pankaj, 27, and Prince Gollapalli, 28, said their classes had been suspended for now, but they were hoping that peace would be restored and they could return to Israel for resumption of their studies.According to the external affairs ministry, there are around 18,000 Indians in Israel and 17 in Palestine. Of them, most are students, several IT professionals and some traders.Operation Ajay was planned to facilitate the return of those who were unable to do so because Air India had immediately suspended its flight after the outbreak of violence on October 7 and its commercial operation remains suspended till now. On Friday, Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar was present at the airport to receive the Indian nationals. Some state governments, including Kerala and West Bengal, had made arrangements for the stay and travel of the residents of their respective states. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israel-Palestine war: What is Israel's Iron Dome and its role in the recent attack

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Israelis to brace themselves for a long and difficult war. Netanyahu addressed the countrymen a day after Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, launched one of the broadest invasions on Israeli territory in 50 years.. Israel has responded with huge strikes on cities in the blockaded Gaza Strip, destroying dozens of buildings, as Hamas continued to fire rockets into Israel. More than 1,100 people have reportedly been killed in Israel and Gaza, authorities said. 
The death toll is expected to rise further.Over the years, Israel has touted the success of its Iron Dome air defense system to thwart and destroy missile attacks. Iron Dome is widely regarded as Israel's first line of defense. It is not yet clear how effective the system was in the recent attack given the number of rockets launched into Israel. Was the Iron Dome missile defense system apparently overwhelmed by the barrage of inexpensive but deadly missiles at the opening of the attack? There are certain social media posts that show Iron Dome destroying rockets fired by Hamas into Israel. What is Iron DomeIron Dome is a missile defense system developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. Developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries, it was first deployed in the year 2011. The system is said to be capable of tackling missiles with ranges between 2.5 miles and about 43 miles.According to Israel's Ministry of Defense, it's capable of successfully handling multiple rockets at a time. The Iron Dome is part of Israel's Missile Defense Organization (IMDO), which has several other systems. How does Iron Dome workAccording to a report in The Hill, quoting Israel's Ministry of Defense, "The Iron Domes uses multi-mission radar to detect what a rocket's route is. The system's command and control center analyzes the trajectory of the rocket and its estimated landing area." The launcher is said to receive the order to operate from the command and control unit to fire a rocket and intercept the incoming one. "The artificial intelligence component of the system determines if people would be in danger of the incoming missile. If a missile is not determined to be a threat, the system will let the rocket land," adds the report.US may send more interceptors for Iron DomeThe US is sending weapons and warships to support Israel. The Pentagon announced Sunday (October 8) that it was sending additional munitions to Israel and moving Navy warships closer to the country in a show of support. According to a report in the New York Times, the US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said that he had ordered the aircraft carrier Gerald R Ford and five guided-missile cruisers and destroyers, which are in the Mediterranean Sea, to the eastern part of the sea, near Israel. Officials said the ships were en route but would take a few days to arrive. The US officials reportedly declined to be more specific about particular weapons systems, but independent analysts said Israel would likely request more interceptors for its Iron Dome missile defense system as well as bombs and missiles for attack planes.

NEW DELHI: Former US President Barack Obama spoke in support of Israel this Monday after days-long silence, leaving Bill Clinton as the only surviving commander-in-chief who has been quiet about the Middle East conflict, reported New York Post."All Americans should be horrified and outraged by the brazen terrorist attacks on Israel and the slaughter of innocent civilians," Obama wrote on X."We grieve for those who died, pray for the safe return of those who've been held hostage, and stand squarely alongside our ally, Israel, as it dismantles Hamas," he added.

NEW DELHI: In Ventura County, California, officials are probing the circumstances leading to the death of a Jewish man who sustained fatal injuries amid a clash at simultaneous protests concerning Israel and Gaza.

Israel's dilemma: Does negotiating with Hamas undermine its anti-terror vow?

In a bid to secure the release of 50 hostages in Gaza, Israel's National Unity Party Minister, Benny Gantz, pushed for a deal that includes a four-day pause in hostilities and the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners. Gantz framed the return of hostages as a "moral imperative and part of the resilience that enables us to win wars." However, questions arise about whether negotiating with Hamas, deemed a terrorist group by Israel, sets a dangerous precedent and gives in to an enemy sworn to destruction.The deal, announced on Tuesday night, has sparked debates about Israel's commitment to its vow against negotiating with terrorists and the potential risks of releasing violent prisoners. 
To delve into the complexities of the situation, Harvard Law School's Robert Mnookin, an expert on negotiation strategy, provides insights into the dilemmas Israel faces and the pressures on American negotiators.In a conversation with Mnookin, he discusses the theoretical framework for hostage negotiation, addressing concerns about the reliability of kidnappers in honoring agreements and the potential precedents set by engaging in negotiations with terrorist groups. Reflecting on past hostage swaps, including the "crazy deal" in 2011 for the release of Gilad Shalit, Mnookin sheds light on the challenges and the emotional goals tied to Israel's ethos of not leaving soldiers behind.As the latest deal unfolds, Mnookin acknowledges the tragic choices often involved in such negotiations, where the release of hostages is a cause for celebration, but questions linger about potential dangers posed by freed prisoners and the encouragement of future kidnappings. The discussion touches on Israel's national values, political pressure, and the psychological aspect of personalizing tragic events.While Mnookin emphasizes the difficulty of these choices, he explores what each side might achieve in the current deal, with Israel securing the release of hostages and a brief suspension of hostilities, and Hamas gaining credit for the release along with humanitarian aid.In conclusion, Mnookin challenges the notion that a successful negotiation is one where both sides are disappointed, asserting that rational actors aim for outcomes superior to their expected alternatives.

NEW DELHI: An American girl, Natalie Raman, who was held captive for two weeks by Hamas before being released, has finally reached her home along with her mother Judith Raanan.The 18-year-old girl was kidnapped when she traveled to Israel to celebrate the 85th birthday of Judith’s mother and celebrate the Jewish holiday season with family, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.The mother-daughter duo arrived in Chicago on Monday night, just four days ahead of Natalie's birthday, as per ABC 7.After the duo arrived in Chicago, Yinam Cohen, the Consul General of Israel to the Midwest, took the X (previously known as Twitter) and posted, “I am relieved that Natalie Raanan is back home in Chicago. Her family members have been anxiously waiting for her return, and today I am sharing their happiness."Both of them were held hostage for 13 days and were released by Hamas after Judith's health started declining.Uri Raanan, Natalie’s father, told The New York Post at the time that his daughter was “emotional” but “very happy to be in Israel.”The Raanan are said to have “kept each other safe” during captivity.“While we’re celebrating Natalie’s return, we remember the 239 hostages, among them babies, children, women, and the elderly, who are still held by Hamas in Gaza,” he said.He also announced that families who have captured relatives will speak in Chicago to share their stories.Currently, the situation in Israel and Palestine remains the same. 
There are more than 230 hostages still under the control of Hamas terrorists in Gaza after the invasion on October 7. After the surprise attack, Israel retaliated and launched several attacks on its counterparts. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said that the war death toll hit 8,796.

SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir administration barred Friday namaz at Srinagar's historic Jamia Masjid and confined Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq to his residence amid speculation that authorities were trying to pre-empt a post-prayer protest against Israel's crackdown on Hamas in Palestine.Anjuman Auqaf Jama Masjid, which manages Kashmir's largest mosque, issued a statement expressing "surprise and deep regret" at the administration's action. It said security officials forced shut all doors to the shrine in the morning and announced without explanation that no congregation would be allowed for the day.The mosque committee also claimed that the Mirwaiz had been put under house arrest, weeks after being released from four years of detention in his Srinagar home. Till late Friday, there was no official word on whether the separatist leader had been detained again or only stopped from stepping out for prayers.The Mirwaiz, 14th in a line of Kashmir's most influential Islamic clerics, had been allowed to offer namaz at the Jamia Masjid in front of a large gathering of followers on September 22.Friday's action coincided with the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre in Jordan including the Mirwaiz in its list of "500 most influential Muslim personalities" for 2024.

In anticipation of the global "day of Jihad" called for by former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal, the New York Police Department is deploying additional security measures to prevent potential disturbances. Concerns surrounding the event have left religious institutions on high alert, and some Jewish parents anxious about sending their children to school.On Thursday, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) issued a statement affirming, "There are no specific, credible threats to New York City." However, the police statement acknowledged the concerns raised by online postings. "We have heightened our presence with uniformed officers at major gatherings and cultural sites to prioritize public safety, exercising an abundance of caution," the statement said.According to a report in the New York Post, during a meeting with Jewish community leaders, deputy commissioner of the NYPD Intelligence and Counterterrorism Bureau, Rebecca Weiner, emphasized that the increased security measures were precautionary and based on an abundance of caution. 
She clarified that there were no specific or credible threats to the city at this time.Weiner said, "This is to deter anyone who would seek to do us harm in this city. We still are not seeing any threat reporting suggesting violence in New York City. We are obviously aware that that can change at any moment."To enhance security, the NYPD has advised religious centers to restrict access to their premises, maintain locked doors, ensure the functionality of security cameras and alarms, conduct perimeter sweeps, and screen mail and packages.In preparation for anticipated protests, all NYPD officers have been instructed to report for duty in uniform. The memo, circulated to all members of the NYPD, specified that no excusals or shift changes would be granted, and the order would remain in effect "until further notice."While Khaled Meshaal did not explicitly call for violence in his call for global protests in support of Palestine, Mayor Eric Adams urged New Yorkers to remain vigilant. He reassured the public, stating that there were no credible or specific threats against the city at present.Some schools have also taken additional security measures in light of potential trouble.Columbia University temporarily closed its campus to the public after an Israeli student was assaulted near the school's library following an altercation over posters related to Hamas-hostage victims. Protests for Palestine had already begun in parts of the city, and some New Yorkers, like 22-year-old Albert Jurkowsk, expressed their support for peaceful demonstrations.Washington, and other cities on alert tooSimilarly, officials in Washington, DC, like their counterparts in New York, are ramping up security measures in anticipation of Friday's protests."We are strengthening security measures across the Capitol Complex," the US Capitol Police said in a statement. "While some of our efforts will be visible, for safety reasons, we cannot divulge all the specifics regarding the resources we are deploying to safeguard Congress."The statement emphasized the continuous efforts of dedicated teams collaborating with local law enforcement and intelligence agencies nationwide "to ensure the safety of everyone."As per a Fox News report, the FBI has taken proactive steps to protect Americans and stated its awareness of and vigilance concerning Friday's global events.In an official statement, the FBI affirmed its collaboration with law enforcement partners across the US to share information and preemptively address any emerging threats, the Fox News reported."As always, we treat any tips or leads regarding potential threats seriously, conducting thorough investigations to assess their credibility," the FBI said. "We urge the public to remain vigilant and promptly report anything they find suspicious to law enforcement." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Expert warns Iran's entry into Israel-Hamas war could compel Russia and China to intervene

Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, concerns are growing over the potential for the involvement of major world powers, namely the United States, Russia, and China. Professor Justin Bronk, a prominent military expert from London's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), has issued a stark warning regarding the situation, reported Mail Online.Professor Bronk has emphasized that if Iran were to launch an attack on Israel in retaliation for its incursion into Gaza, this could trigger a chain of events that might compel Russia and China to intervene. He pointed out that Iran, along with its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon, could provide a secondary front in the conflict. 
The United States has already issued warnings to Hezbollah and Iran, urging them to refrain from entering the war.Until now, Russia and China have shown restraint in their public statements regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict. However, should Iran become directly involved, Russia may feel obligated to support it, given the strategic relationship between the two nations.The situation in the region has become increasingly complex. Israel has launched airstrikes in southern Gaza, urging Palestinians to evacuate ahead of an anticipated ground invasion. These airstrikes have tragically resulted in the loss of dozens of lives.Additionally, violence along Israel's border with Lebanon has sparked concerns of a broader regional conflict. Diplomatic efforts have been underway to prevent further escalation, but the situation remains highly volatile.Notably, historian Niall Ferguson has drawn attention to the current events, drawing parallels with the turbulent period of the 1930s and raising the question of whether this crisis could potentially lead to a more extensive global conflict.As the Israel-Hamas conflict continues to evolve, the international community remains on edge, with the risk of a wider conflict involving major world powers looming on the horizon.

Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, concerns are growing over the potential for the involvement of major world powers, namely the United States, Russia, and China. Professor Justin Bronk, a prominent military expert from London's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), has issued a stark warning regarding the situation, reported Mail Online.Professor Bronk has emphasized that if Iran were to launch an attack on Israel in retaliation for its incursion into Gaza, this could trigger a chain of events that might compel Russia and China to intervene. He pointed out that Iran, along with its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon, could provide a secondary front in the conflict. 
The United States has already issued warnings to Hezbollah and Iran, urging them to refrain from entering the war.Until now, Russia and China have shown restraint in their public statements regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict. However, should Iran become directly involved, Russia may feel obligated to support it, given the strategic relationship between the two nations.The situation in the region has become increasingly complex. Israel has launched airstrikes in southern Gaza, urging Palestinians to evacuate ahead of an anticipated ground invasion. These airstrikes have tragically resulted in the loss of dozens of lives.Additionally, violence along Israel's border with Lebanon has sparked concerns of a broader regional conflict. Diplomatic efforts have been underway to prevent further escalation, but the situation remains highly volatile.Notably, historian Niall Ferguson has drawn attention to the current events, drawing parallels with the turbulent period of the 1930s and raising the question of whether this crisis could potentially lead to a more extensive global conflict.As the Israel-Hamas conflict continues to evolve, the international community remains on edge, with the risk of a wider conflict involving major world powers looming on the horizon.

A pregnant woman in Gaza is prepared to give birth even as war rages, the CNN reported.Khulood Khaled, a 28-year-old woman who is eight months pregnant, made a decision to leave her home in the al-Karama district of northern Gaza due to the relentless bombing.CNN quoted her as saying "We watched houses dropping as we drove, thinking we could die any minute".On the way, she saw refugees being struck by Israeli jets "just meters away," She hugged her son "so we'd die together.Eventually, she arrived in the southern city of Khan Younis, as reported by CNN. However, the situation there is dire, with limited access to food, water, and electricity as Gaza faces a severe shortage of supplies.Khulood is not alone, as approximately 50,000 women in Gaza are currently pregnant, with 10% expected to give birth in the coming month, according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).These mothers now face a "double nightmare" following a week of horrifying Israeli airstrikes, as described by Dominic Allen, the UNFPA's Representative for the State of Palestine.The situation comes in the aftermath of a Hamas attack on October 7, prompting Israel to vow "mighty vengeance" and impose a "complete siege" on the territory.This blockade has resulted in severe shortages of water, electricity, goods, and fuel.Many residents of Gaza have heeded Israel's call to evacuate from the northern areas, with hundreds of thousands heading south to seek safety.CNN reported that some have been worried about the safety of the escape routes and it has geolocated and authenticated videos from the scene of a large explosion on Friday along a route to the south.

NAGPUR: Born in a town near Tel Aviv and brought up in Nagpur, Sivan Jacob Jaiswal is stranded in war-torn Israel with her three-and-half-year-old son Aviel after she was denied evacuation by Indian authorities under Operation Ajay for possessing an Israeli passport. When she couldn't board the Air India emergency flights that brought home more than 470 Indians, Sivan appealed to Indian authorities to help her return to her husband in Nagpur. 
The mother-son duo enjoys the status of 'Overseas Citizens of India'. In January, Sivan went to Israel to complete the formalities of an Israeli passport and visa for her son and had planned to return in December. While she is spending restless moments with her child in Bnei Brak since the October 7 attack by the Palestinian radical group Hamas, her husband Ankush is also living on the edge, watching the horror unfold on television and social media.Ankush first met Sivan at Bishop Cotton School in Nagpur and married her in 2008. The couple was blessed with a son after a prolonged wait and medical complications during the Covid-induced lockdown in March 2020. Later, Sivan flew to Israel with her firstborn to introduce him to his family and friends. Ankush said he reposes faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and his wife and son would soon return to India. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has deployed six warships in the region amid escalating tensions. According to the South China Morning Post, these warships, including the Zibo, a Type 052D guided-missile destroyer, the frigate Jingzhou, and the integrated supply ship Qiandaohu, were part of the PLA's 44th naval escort task force.On October 14, these warships left the shores of Muscat for an undisclosed destination, as reported by Chinese state media. This naval presence signifies the operation of six Chinese vessels in Middle Eastern waters during the heightened tensions in the region.United States has deployed the USS Gerald R Ford, its most advanced aircraft carrier, and a battle group to the West Asia region in response to the situation. 
Additionally, several countries, including Britain, Germany, and France, have sent military or civilian planes to evacuate their nationals from Israel.While China has not yet announced an evacuation plan, the Chinese foreign ministry advised Chinese citizens to leave the area as soon as possible using commercial flights. In previous situations, China has utilized escort warships similar to those currently in the region for evacuations. For instance, in May, China sent a supply ship and a Type 052D destroyer to evacuate over 1,000 Chinese, Brazilians, and Pakistanis from areas affected by armed conflicts. In 2015, Chinese warships also played a role in evacuating 225 foreigners and nearly 600 Chinese nationals from Yemen.On October 19, Chinese President Xi Jinping reaffirmed Beijing's longstanding position in favor of establishing a sovereign state of Palestine, as reported by state media. He emphasized that this approach represents "the fundamental way" to resolve the ongoing conflict in the region."The top priority now is a ceasefire as soon as possible, to avoid the conflict from expanding or even spiraling out of control and causing a serious humanitarian crisis," Jinping said.

NEW DELHI: Outspoken billionaire Elon Musk has said that Israel should find members of Hamas and either "kill or incarcerate" them to put an end to the problem once and for all.In a candid interview with US-based podcaster Lex Freidman, the SpaceX and Tesla chief said that unless Israel eliminates Hamas members, they will keep coming back."I think it's appropriate for Israel to find the Hamas members and either kill them or incarcerate them, that's something that has to be done because they are going to keep coming otherwise," Musk said.During the interview, Musk said it's difficul to find easy answers to the ongoing war between Israel and Gaza due to the complex reality of the Middle East. Musk said that Hamas launched the unprecedented attack on Israel last month to provoke an overreaction from the country." 
... strictly my opinion is that the goal of Hamas was to provoke an overreaction from Israel. They (Hamas) didn’t expect to have a military victory. They really wanted to commit the worst atrocities they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel and leverage that response to rally Muslims worldwide for the cause of Gaza and Palestine,” the Tesla CEO said.The eccentric businessman suggested that Israel should engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible, despite the challenges involved.“The counterintuitive thing that should be done, even though it is difficult is that: Israel should engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible,” Musk added.Musk also emphasiszed the importance of providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, proposing the establishment of a mobile hospital.

NEW DELHI: Noted author JK Rowling on Thursday condemned the brutal assault by Hamas on Israel last Saturday, calling it the "biggest massacre of Jews since Holocaust."In a post on X, the author of the Harry Potter books attached a newspaper report in which a UK mother has claimed that Jewish students at her daughter's school are being advised to hide their skullcaps and how anti-semetic messages have cropped up in the country.Reacting to this, Rowling said that UK once used to be a safe haven but Jewish students in the country are now being asked to hide their identities. The author added there should be "mass outrage" over this."We said 'never again.' 
The UK was a safe haven. Now, after the biggest massacre of Jews since the holocaust, British Jewish children are being advised to hide their identities as they walk to school, for their own safety. There should be mass outrage that this is necessary," Rowling said in her post.Notably, reports of antisemitic incidents in Britain since the weekend have tripled compared with the same period last year following the outbreak of new Israel-Palestinian conflict, Reuters reported quoting a Jewish charity.In days since the attack, British Jews and Israelis have been holding a vigil outside Downing Street in central London to condemn the attacks in Israel.

Columbia University professor is facing significant backlash following his public endorsement of the recent Hamas terror attacks as "awesome," New York Post reported.In response to professor Joseph Massad's comments, a petition calling for his removal has garnered 20,000 signatures.Massad, who teaches politics and history at the university is currently under scrutiny for "condoning and supporting terrorism," according to the New York Post which cited a student who mounted the petition. The professor was also previously probed by the Ivy League school in Manhattan for alleged anti-Israel remarks in class.The Change.org petition, launched by 23-year-old junior and former student-body president Maya Platek, strongly criticizes Massad for his failure to condemn Hamas for its actions and instead expressing support.In particular, the petition targets Massad for an article he wrote on the "Electronic Intifada" website.This article was posted shortly after the Hamas attacks on Israel, in what he called "the stunning victory of the Palestinian resistance" against "cruel colonizers."Platek stated in her petition that "Massad's decision to praise last week's abhorrent attack encourages violence and misinformation in and outside of campus, particularly putting many Jewish and Israeli students on campus at risk."Moreover, many students have expressed that they feel unsafe in the presence of a professor who supports the horrific murders of civilians," she said.Platek reportedly told The New York Post that she launched the petition "because I heard concerns from a couple dozen Columbia students. 
""I have seen a lot of support from the Columbia student body, alumni, and many others who are concerned that there is a professor at Columbia who supports terrorism," she said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

A hit-and-run incident at Stanford University that resulted in injury to an Arab-Muslim student is currently under investigation as a potential hate crime. The event took place on a Friday afternoon and was reported by the Stanford Department of Public Safety. The student, Abdulwahab Omira, reported that the driver made direct eye contact before accelerating and hitting them. 
Allegedly, the driver hurled a derogatory remark regarding the victim's ethnic background while fleeing the scene.The suspect is described as a white male in his mid-20s with specific physical features and was driving a newer model black Toyota 4Runner. Authorities are actively seeking information and have requested anyone with knowledge of the incident to contact the California Highway Patrol.Meanwhile, Abdulwahab Omira has issued a public appeal from his hospital bed. In his statement, Omira reflected on the incident with a call for love, kindness, and compassion against the backdrop of a world grappling with hatred and prejudice. He emphasized his commitment to advocating for understanding and inclusivity. Omira also expressed criticism towards Stanford University for what he perceived as a delayed and downplayed response to the incident, which required significant advocacy for proper acknowledgment.Stanford's administration, including President Richard Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez, condemned the violence and the hate-based nature of the attack, affirming their support for the student and the broader community affected by the incident. The search for the assailant continues, with the university's Public Safety Department providing a description of the individual and the vehicle involved.This incident has raised concerns amid a reported increase in threats and violence against Muslim Americans and heightened antisemitic incidents in the US following the Israel-Hamas conflict. The situation is particularly sensitive as it follows other serious hate crime allegations, including a fatal attack on a Palestinian family near Chicago. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

In anticipation of the global "day of Jihad" called for by former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal, the New York Police Department is deploying additional security measures to prevent potential disturbances. Concerns surrounding the event have left religious institutions on high alert, and some Jewish parents anxious about sending their children to school.On Thursday, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) issued a statement affirming, "There are no specific, credible threats to New York City." However, the police statement acknowledged the concerns raised by online postings. "We have heightened our presence with uniformed officers at major gatherings and cultural sites to prioritize public safety, exercising an abundance of caution," the statement said.According to a report in the New York Post, during a meeting with Jewish community leaders, deputy commissioner of the NYPD Intelligence and Counterterrorism Bureau, Rebecca Weiner, emphasized that the increased security measures were precautionary and based on an abundance of caution. 
She clarified that there were no specific or credible threats to the city at this time.Weiner said, "This is to deter anyone who would seek to do us harm in this city. We still are not seeing any threat reporting suggesting violence in New York City. We are obviously aware that that can change at any moment."To enhance security, the NYPD has advised religious centers to restrict access to their premises, maintain locked doors, ensure the functionality of security cameras and alarms, conduct perimeter sweeps, and screen mail and packages.In preparation for anticipated protests, all NYPD officers have been instructed to report for duty in uniform. The memo, circulated to all members of the NYPD, specified that no excusals or shift changes would be granted, and the order would remain in effect "until further notice."While Khaled Meshaal did not explicitly call for violence in his call for global protests in support of Palestine, Mayor Eric Adams urged New Yorkers to remain vigilant. He reassured the public, stating that there were no credible or specific threats against the city at present.Some schools have also taken additional security measures in light of potential trouble.Columbia University temporarily closed its campus to the public after an Israeli student was assaulted near the school's library following an altercation over posters related to Hamas-hostage victims. Protests for Palestine had already begun in parts of the city, and some New Yorkers, like 22-year-old Albert Jurkowsk, expressed their support for peaceful demonstrations.Washington, and other cities on alert tooSimilarly, officials in Washington, DC, like their counterparts in New York, are ramping up security measures in anticipation of Friday's protests."We are strengthening security measures across the Capitol Complex," the US Capitol Police said in a statement. "While some of our efforts will be visible, for safety reasons, we cannot divulge all the specifics regarding the resources we are deploying to safeguard Congress."The statement emphasized the continuous efforts of dedicated teams collaborating with local law enforcement and intelligence agencies nationwide "to ensure the safety of everyone."As per a Fox News report, the FBI has taken proactive steps to protect Americans and stated its awareness of and vigilance concerning Friday's global events.In an official statement, the FBI affirmed its collaboration with law enforcement partners across the US to share information and preemptively address any emerging threats, the Fox News reported."As always, we treat any tips or leads regarding potential threats seriously, conducting thorough investigations to assess their credibility," the FBI said. "We urge the public to remain vigilant and promptly report anything they find suspicious to law enforcement." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Amid the raging Israel-Hamas conflict, leaders of Brics countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — will on Tuesday join a virtual extraordinary meeting on the West Asia situation along with their counterparts from newly added member-states — Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the UAE, South Africa said in an official announcement.While both Russian President Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have confirmed participation, India is likely to be represented by foreign minister S Jaishankar. The meet will be chaired by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and will be followed by a joint statement on Gaza. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres, who’s been calling for an immediate ceasefire, will also join the meeting.It will be interesting to see if India endorses any joint statement seeking a ceasefire since it had, unlike other Brics founding members, not backed a UNGA resolution for a “humanitarian truce’’. While India had abstained from voting as the resolution didn’t condemn Hamas’s terrorist attacks, others had all voted in favour.In fact, even among the new members, all except Ethiopia had voted in favour of the resolution. 
Like India, Ethiopia had abstained. Ramaphosa said on Monday that peace won’t be possible until the “Palestinians are free’’.PM Modi had condemned the Hamas terror attacks on the very first day of the conflict and, walking the diplomatic tightrope, his government later sought to balance India’s position by underlining the significance of international humanitarian law, sending aid to Gaza and reiterating support for a two-state solution.“President Ramaphosa will deliver the opening remarks at the Brics extraordinary meeting, where member and invited states will also deliver country statements on the current crisis in Gaza,” South Africa said.

How Hamas managed to plan devastating attack while keeping Israel's spy agencies in the dark

NEW DELHI: Saturday's devastating attack against Israel by Hamas fighters from Gaza Strip have sent shockwaves across the world and has left experts questioning how one of the the world's best intelligence apparatus was kept in the dark by the terrorist organisation.Coordinated attackIn an extensive and well-coordinated assault, Hamas launched thousands of rockets at Israel within a matter of 20 minutes all while hundreds of its fighters breached the fence around Gaza Strip with bulldozers, ground vehicles and motorbikes.Several dozen Hamas fighters also used hang gliders and mechanised parachute gliders to get deep into Israeli territory before beginning their rampage. Experts believe that Hamas also decided to use some of its 'air-borne' fighters to attack the musical festival near the Gaza Strip to maximise casualties and hostages. Several videos on the Internet show the paragliders flying over the festival as party-goers look on without realising what was happening. There are also reports that some Hamas fighters tried to reach Israel via the open ocean in motorised dinghies but were quickly neutralised by the Israeli navy.'They got us'Israel concedes it was caught off guard by an attack timed to coincide with the Jewish Sabbath and a religious holiday."This is our 9/11," said Major Nir Dinar, spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Forces. 
"They got us ... They surprised us and they came fast from many spots - both from the air and the ground and the sea."No leaks, even fighters kept in the darkIsrael has long prided itself on its ability to infiltrate and monitor Islamist groups. As a consequence, a crucial part of the terrorist organisation's plan was to avoid leaks, said a report by Reuters citing a source close to Hamas.Many Hamas leaders were unaware of the plans and, while training, the 1,000 fighters deployed in the assault had no inkling of the exact purpose of the exercises.Operation divided into four partsWhen the day came, the operation was divided into four parts, the Hamas source said.The first move was a barrage of 3,000 rockets fired from Gaza that coincided with incursions by fighters who flew hang gliders, or motorised paragliders, over the border, the source said.Once the fighters on hang-gliders were on the ground, they secured the terrain so an elite commando unit could storm the fortified electronic and cement wall built by Israel to prevent infiltration.The fighters used explosives to breach the barriers and then sped across on motorbikes. Bulldozers widened the gaps and more fighters entered in four-wheel drives.Hamas misled IsraelSeveral experts say Saturday's assault, the worst breach in Israel's defences since Arab armies waged war in 1973, followed two years of subterfuge by Hamas that involved keeping its military plans under wraps and convincing Israel it did not want a fight.While Israel was led to believe it was containing a war-weary Hamas by providing economic incentives to Gazan workers, the group's fighters were being trained and drilled, often in plain sight, said a Reuters report citing a source close to Hamas."Hamas gave Israel the impression that it was not ready for a fight," the source said, adding: "Hamas used an unprecedented intelligence tactic to mislead Israel over the last months, by giving a public impression that it was not willing to get into a fight with Israel while preparing for this massive operation."Hamas built mock Israeli settlement for training fightersIn one of the most striking elements of their preparations, Hamas constructed a mock Israeli settlement in Gaza where they practiced a military landing and trained to storm it, the source close to Hamas said, adding they even made videos of the manoeuvres."Israel surely saw them but they were convinced that Hamas wasn't keen on getting into a confrontation," the source said.Meanwhile, Hamas sought to convince Israel it cared more about ensuring that workers in Gaza, a narrow strip of land with more than two million residents, had access to jobs across the border and had no interest in starting a new war."Hamas was able to build a whole image that it was not ready for a military adventure against Israel," the source said.Israel turned a blind eyeMany experts also believe that the Benjamin Netanyahu government purposefully ignored incidents of Hamas fighters training and doing drills in order to maintain its fragile ceasefire with the organisation.In the past, Netanyahu has reportedly said that those who oppose a Palestinian state should support the transfer of funds to Gaza, as maintaining separation between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza would prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.Turning a blind eye to what Israel might have considered minor terror incidents was part of the policy to keep pumping funds into the Gaza Strip by issuing work permits, all in order to maintain a fragile peace while undermining any efforts by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to establish a proper state.Work permitsSince a 2021 war with Hamas, Israel has sought to provide a basic level of economic stability in Gaza by offering incentives including thousands of permits so Gazans can work in Israel or the West Bank, where salaries in construction, agriculture or service jobs can be 10 times the level of pay in Gaza."We believed that the fact that they were coming in to work and bringing money into Gaza would create a certain level of calm. We were wrong," another Israeli army spokesperson said.An Israeli security source acknowledged Israel's security services were duped by Hamas. "They caused us to think they wanted money," the source said. "And all the time they were involved in exercises/drills until they ran riot."Hamas practiced restraintAs part of its subterfuge in the past two years, Hamas refrained from military operations against Israel, even as another Gaza-based Islamist armed group known as Islamic Jihad launched a series of its own assaults or rocket attacks.So convincing was Hamas' image of not wanting to fight Israel that many of its own supporters started to question the group's abilities.Abbas and his Fatah group even mocked Hamas for going quiet. In one Fatah statement in June 2022, the group accused Hamas leaders of fleeing to Arab capitals to live in "luxurious hotels and villas" leaving their people to poverty in Gaza.

'Ukraine... Israel-Gaza conflict... Prophet Song anticipates this'

The morning after the Booker Prize 2023 event in London, Irish writer Paul Lynch, who won the prestigious 50,000 literary honour for his dystopian novel Prophet Song, was still in shock. "I don't quite believe it," Lynch told TOI. "I feel as though I have entered into a counterfactual narrative that parallels my usual life. 
I probably should be in the kitchen at home, making a cup of coffee or something like that. And this is the sliding door thing that I'm actually riding. At any moment now, I'll be returned to my normal life. I'll have to get in the car and go do some shopping and collect the kids from school, that kind of thing."Prophet Song imagines an Ireland that has descended into totalitarianism. "We're always trying to think of the end of the world as this sort of global catastrophe," he said, discussing the book. "Really, the end of the world is something that comes to comes to communities. It comes to people who are in plight." Lynch, 46, added: "Ukraine has happened, and the Israeli Gaza-Palestine conflict has happened. And the book anticipates this because that's part of the idea of the book is that what's happening now will happen again and has always happened." In his acceptance speech, Lynch quoted the apocryphal gospels: "If you use what is within you, it will save you. If you do not use what is within you, it will destroy you. My writing has saved me." Asked about it, he told TOI: "The question of free will has always been in my novels. I'm deeply interested in aligning on the page two seemingly separate forces. One is the individual... We all are feeling, passionate creatures. We search for meaning and we are trying to make sense of the world around us. But there are these enormous, implacable alien forces that are shaping us, moving our lives, casting us around like specks of dust. How are we to make sense of this? Prophet Song is, in many ways, about this. All my books are about this. How do we understand ourselves? How do we define who we are? These are all questions, but I'm seeking to answer them in my own way." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Pro Palestinian protesters held demonstrations outside a vacation home of AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) president Michael Tuchin in Los Angeles on Thursday. The protestors set off smoke bombs and called AIPAC president 'baby killer,' the Times of Israel reported.Reportedly, they also placed bundles of cloth covered in red paint and spilled red paint outside the residence, symbolizing blood, while chanting phrases "Fuck your holiday" at the head of the US’s largest pro-Israel lobby. 
The rally was carried out by The People’s City Council, a Los Angeles-based group identifying as anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist, according to Times of Israel.In their post on X, they characterized the event as a "holiday wake-up call."“AIPAC spends tens of millions to control pro-genocide congress members. Fuck your holiday baby killer!” it wrote.The StopAntisemitism organization called the rally “horrifying.”“What’s next? The burning of synagogues and schools like in 1939 Germany?” it posted on X.The AIPAC is a pro-Israel lobby that advocates policies within the legislative and executive branches of the United States. As one of several pro-Israel lobbying groups in the country, AIPAC claims a membership exceeding 100,000 individuals, operates 17 regional offices, and has a substantial base of donors. Experts call it the "the single most important organization in promoting the US–Israel alliance." AIPAC is also recognized as one of the most influential lobbying groups in the United States.

Now more than ever, we need to unite on climate and deliver a clear message of hope, solidarity, stability and prosperity,” said Al Jaber while delivering his opening remarks at pre-Cop in Abu Dhabi (UAE).“We need to show that the international community can deliver and send a clear signal that keeps 1.5 (degree Celsius) within reach...We need solid solutions for a 43% cut in emissions by 2030 because that is exactly what the science tells us,” he said, referring to the solutions agreed upon by countries at different multilateral forum including New Delhi G20 leaders’ summit in September.Pre-Cop is a preparatory meeting of ministers and negotiators ahead of Cop28 which is to be held in Dubai during November 29-December 12. India is represented there by the environment secretary Leena Nandan.G20 New Delhi leaders’ declaration pitched for rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 43% by 2030 relative to the 2019 levels to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. Leaders also promised to triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2030 to meet that goal.On the issue of fossil fuels use, Al Jaber urged countries’ representatives to work together to come forward with solutions at Cop28 that can achieve common ground and consensus between all parties. 
“We must be pragmatic. And we must leave no-one behind,” he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rejected the prospect of a ceasefire in Gaza on Wednesday, amid reports of negotiations for a three-day temporary ceasefire with Hamas."I'd like to put to rest all kinds of false rumours we're hearing from all kinds of directions, and reiterate one clear thing: There will be no ceasefire without the release of our hostages," he said.Earlier, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said that the lifeline has been unjustly, outrageously thin. He called for the parties to agree a ceasefire." We have fallen off a precipice and this cannot continue. 
Actions of one party do not absolve the actions of the other party. Even in the context of a 56-year occupation, the situation is the most dangerous we have faced for people in Gaza, in Israel, in the West Bank but also regionally," he added. Earlier, on Monday, Israeli PM said that Israel would consider "tactical little pauses" in Gaza fighting to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid or allow the exit of hostages held by Hamasmilitants. But the Israeli PM reiterated his country's rejection of a ceasefire without the release of all people being held captive in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian enclave.He made the comments in a US television interview.Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden had discussed the potential for "tactical pauses" in their latest phone call, the White House said on Monday. On Tuesday, White House spokesman John Kirby noted Netanyahu's comments to ABC on the possible pauses, telling MSNBC in an interview: "We're going to keep talking to him about this and, as appropriate, we'll see what we can do to help put them in place."

Now, Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy has joined the debate surrounding companies targeting US college students for their pro-Palestine statements.Ramaswamy, a Harvard- and Yale-educated entrepreneur and the sole millennial contender in the Republican race, took to X to address the situation regarding Harvard student groups that faced public scrutiny for signing a letter attributing responsibility to Israel for the terrorist attack by Hamas militants on October 7.He termed the Harvard student groups who endorsed the anti-Israel letter as "simple fools." "The Harvard student groups who co-signed the anti-Israel letter are simple fools," Ramaswamy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. "But it's not productive for companies to blacklist kids for being members of student groups that make dumb political statements on campus."The Harvard student groups who co-signed the anti-Israel letter are simple fools. 
But it's not productive for companies to blacklist kids for being members of student groups that make dumb political statements on campus.Ramaswamy also slammed the "cancel culture". "I've been as vocal as anyone in criticizing left-wing cancel culture, but it's bad no matter who practices it," he said."Those calling for blacklisting students right now are responding from a place of understandable hurt, but I'm confident that in the fullness of time, they will agree with me on the wisdom of avoiding these cancel-culture tactics," the Indian-American entrepreneur said.Ramaswamy's stance on the issue differs significantly from that of Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund manager and Harvard alum who has supported Ramaswamy's presidential candidacy. Ackman has advocated for identifying members of the student groups and ensuring that they are not admitted into the corporate world.He has been asked by several CEOs whether Harvard could release a list of members from the organizations that issued the letter blaming Israel for the acts of Hamas. Ackman argued that, if these members endorse the letter, their names should be made public to make their views known. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: A US-born woman whose daughter was among 260 people Hamas terrorists killed in its October 7 attack at a music festival in Israel urged Americans to reconsider their stand in support of the terror group, reported the New York Post.Bullets shot by the terrorists arbitrarily pierced through Tribe of Nova Event in Israel's southern territory, hitting Hannie Ricardo's 26-year-old daughter Oriya, who was part of the crowd that went haywire during the massacre."You have terrorists and a lot of people in America support them. In the name of freedom of speech, you let them talk and support these terrorists," Ricardo told The Post."I know you have this amendment of freedom of speech, but you also support that freedom of hate. What do you do with that?
 Freedom of hate - is that good? Just give me one good reason for freedom of hate.""They are hateful people and they live in order to kill. This is not war. In wars, as stupid as they are, they have armies fighting against armies. This was a Nazi-organized operation. This sort of cruelty you saw during the Holocaust. ... Is this a war? It's not a war. It's slaughtering people for fun," said Oriya's mother to the New York Post.Some 1,300 were killed in the worst attack on civilians in Israel's history. Israeli forces have since put the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, under a total siege and bombarded it with unprecedented air strikes.Gaza authorities say more than 2,200 people have been killed, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded.On Friday, more than a million residents in northern Gaza received a 24-hour notice from Israel to evacuate south before an anticipated ground offensive. Despite this, Hamas pledged to fight until the end and advised residents to remain in their homes. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'Everyone ages differently': Newly-elected Speaker Mike Johnson on Biden's cognitive decline

NEW DELHI: House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) expressed concerns about President Biden's cognitive decline after his meeting with the Commander in Chief for the first time in his new role as the leader of the lower chamber of Congress.During an interview with Fox News, he said, “I do. I think most of us do,” Johnson said when asked if he sees cognitive decline in Joe Biden. 
“This is not a personal slight to him. It has to do with age and acumen, and everyone’s different. Everyone ages differently.”Johnson acknowledged the differences between Joe Biden's past performances in the Senate Judiciary Committee and his recent speeches. He emphasized that this observation wasn't meant as a personal insult to the President.According to a report in New York Post, the meeting between Johnson, who is a 51-year-old Louisiana Republican, and President Biden revolved around Biden’s request for $106 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel, and other projects. Johnson had recently won the Speaker's gavel with unanimous backing from House GOP members, following a leadership struggle.The leadership change followed the ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy, with some members claiming that McCarthy had broken promises to their caucus by passing a bipartisan government spending bill. This bill, known as a continuing resolution, is designed to fund the government until at least November 17, a date that Johnson suggested might need to be extended to January or April 2024, New York Post reported.Rep. Matt Gaetz and other GOP lawmakers had also alleged a secret deal between McCarthy and Biden regarding Ukraine funding. Johnson, however, confirmed that his caucus did not approve of packaging foreign aid together and advocated for separating these issues.According to the report, he expressed the House Republicans' commitment to stopping Vladimir Putin's offensive in Eastern Europe, as they believed that allowing Putin to prevail in Ukraine might encourage China to take action against Taiwan.Biden's national security package combined $61.4 billion in Ukraine funding with $14.3 billion for Israel, which was dealing with a conflict involving Hamas terrorists. The package also included $9.15 billion in humanitarian aid, some of which was allocated for Palestinian civilians in Gaza.Johnson voiced skepticism about sending aid to Gaza, expressing concerns about the potential misuse of funds by terrorist organizations. He highlighted the importance of ensuring that the White House provides accountability for the allocated funds, New York Post reported. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Indiana woman crashes car 'on purpose' into 'Jewish school': Police

A woman in Indiana has been detained after purportedly driving her car into a building she mistook for a Jewish school. The suspect, 34-year-old Ruba Almaghtheh, is accused of reversing her vehicle into a structure affiliated with the Black Hebrew Israelites in Indianapolis, where several adults and children were present at the time. Fortunately, the incident resulted in no injuries.Almaghtheh confessed to deliberately targeting the building, which is the site of the Israelite School of Universal and Practical Knowledge, due to her objection to a symbol representing "Hebrew Israelite" displayed outside. 
Following her arrest, she admitted to the act and mentioned her connections to Palestine while referring to the building as the "Israel school."The building in question is linked to a sect of the Black Hebrew Israelites, not a Jewish institution, as clarified by the Anti-Defamation League. Despite the misidentification, the incident has prompted the Jewish Federation of Greater Indianapolis to collaborate with local security programs to investigate further and reinforce security measures within the community.Almaghtheh, who the police have labeled a "terrorist," faces preliminary charges of criminal recklessness and is scheduled for an initial court appearance on Wednesday.The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) has informed the FBI of the arrest, and the FBI is reportedly collaborating with the local police on the case.This incident occurs against a backdrop of increasing domestic hate crimes in the US, with the Department of Homeland Security recently issuing a warning about a heightened threat environment due to the escalation of conflict between Israel and Hamas. FBI director Christopher Wray also highlighted the disproportionate number of hate crimes against Jewish people in the United States, noting that while they constitute only 2.4% of the US population, they are victims of nearly 60% of all religious-based hate crimes.

This is no time to lower our guard, say security experts on 26/11 attacks anniv

Mumbai: Acknowledging that Israel failed to prevent the October 7 Hamas attack, Col Avihay Zafrany, defence attache to Israel embassy in India, said “technology is important, but not enough” in the war against terrorism.
 Col Zafrany was among many security experts, veterans and retired armed services officials who spoke at the 3rd National Security Conference in Bandra to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the 26/11 attacks on Sunday. Think tank Brahma Research Foundation (BRF), patronised by BJP MLA Ashish Shelar, held the event as a tribute to the martyrs of the 26/11 attacks and also to assess preparations to prevent such horrific attacks in the future.
Col Zafrany said Israel took all precautions to keep damage to the civilians minimum while it retaliated to the October 7 attack. He said that “Hamas has turned Palestine into a terror state and is using human shields” to create more fear. He said Hamas is using guerilla warfare, adding that there doesn’t seem to be an end to the emergence of new terror outfits, starting with al-Qaida and ISIS, and now Hamas.
Kobbi Shoshani, consul general of Israel to midwest India, recalled how Mumbai was in pain after the 26/11 attacks. He said he remembered the horrific days when he visited Nariman House (one of the targets) on Sunday morning. “We are not only fighting terrorism, but are also dealing with fake news,” he said.
Chief guest Vice Admiral Dinesh Tripathi, commander in chief, Western Naval Command, called the 26/11 attacks a “big infamy in India’s history”. “Mumbai, India’s financial capital, was under siege. State actors, in the guise of non-state actors, attacked Mumbai. However, the city showed its resilience.” He said there are many complexities of maritime security. “We have taken enough policy measures to prevent another 26/11 attack as the terrorists came from the sea route.” He stressed the need to strengthen maritime defence.
Agreeing with BRF director Dr Vijay Page’s reiteration that “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty”, Lt Gen (retd) V G Khandare, principal adviser to defence minister, said countries that faced attacks like 9/11, 26/11 and October 7, 2023, cannot afford to be overconfident or complacent. “There was an intelligence failure, but every nation must trust its security agencies. We look at only intelligence failures, but do we know how many attacks are prevented by these agencies?”
Former army chief Gen Manoj Naravane said the October 7 Hamas attack only showed that “there is no time to lower our guards”. “Human intelligence is also important as overdependence on technology has its own pitfalls.”

NEW DELHI: A US airline suspended one of its pilots after he praised Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel, which claimed the lives of over 1200 civilians, reported the New York Post.Ibrahim Mossallam, a United Airlines employee, referred to the terrorist group as "brave people" and also urged people to "expand their media literacy", asking them to judge Hamas with "due diligence".Allegedly praising Hamas' attack on Israel, Mossallam called the organisation's action an act of “resistance from brave people who have endured decades of occupation,” reported The Post quoting a post on X (formally Twitter).He said those held captive or were killed in the attack did not occur "without provocation from the other side".Mossallam's statement triggered a massive backlash, following which the airline suspended him. “This pilot has been removed from service, with pay, while we look into this matter,” a spokesperson told the news outlet.Meanwhile, a ceasefire agreement between the Hamas group and Israel has been confirmed by both parties, along with Washington and Qatar, which helped broker the deal that would bring a temporary halt to the devastating war that is now in its seventh week.The Israeli government said that under an outline of the deal, Hamas is to free over a four-day period at least 50 of the roughly 240 hostages.The Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund has named the Gaza Strip as the most dangerous place" in the world to be a child, reported CNN."More than 5,300 Palestinian children have been reportedly killed in just 46 days...That's over 115 a day, every day, for weeks and weeks," Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a video on Wednesday while addressing the UN Security Council.

Aaron Sorkin, the creator of "The West Wing," decided to end his professional relationship with talent agent Maha Dakhil. This decision came about after Dakhil shared a post from a pro-Palestinian Instagram account that criticized Israel's actions in Gaza, referring to them as "genocide," Fox news reported."You're currently learning who supports genocide," the original post read. Dakhil, a Creative Artists Agency (CAA) agent and Co-Head of Motion Pictures, whose clients include the likes of stars like Tom Cruise, Anne Hathaway and Madonna, added her own caption to the post, writing, "That's the line for me." 
Dakhil chose to resign from the CAA's internal agency board and issued an apology through a statement."I made a mistake with a repost in my Instagram story, which used hurtful language. Like so many of us, I have been reeling with heartbreak. I pride myself on being on the side of humanity and peace," she said. "I'm so grateful to Jewish friends and colleagues who pointed out the implications and further educated me. I immediately took the repost down. I'm sorry for the pain I have caused."Meanwhile, Sorkin shared in a statement that he is rejoining the WME (William Morris Endeavor) Agency."Maha isn't an antisemite, she's just wrong. She's a great agent and I'm very proud of the work we did together over the last six years. I'm excited to be returning to WME," he told reportedly.The controversy surrounding Dakhil's initial posts led her to make an additional post in response."Choice of words is important. Dialogue is healing. As each excruciating day passes, I'm listening and learning more from my friends," she wrote. "Thank you. I'm holding all our families in my prayers...I am grieving for everyone who is suffering right now. I continue to mourn all innocent lives. My mission is peace." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday ordered stringent action against any person who tries to whip up frenzy by making comments contrary to India's stand on Israel-Palestine war.The CM also warned the district police chiefs of action over instances of obscene songs and loud music being played in Shobha Yatras and at religious places. Yogi gave the directives while reviewing the government's preparation for the festive season and Mission Shakti rollout.Referring to the ongoing Israel-Palestine war, he told police officials to stay in contact with religious leaders to ensure that no statements or action is done against the Indian stance on the issue. He asked the officials to monitor statements being made on social media or from places of worship. "If somebody makes a deliberate statement on this issue not in line with the stand of India then strict action should be taken against him/her immediately," the CM said.Yogi expressed strong displeasure over delay in resolving revenue matters pertaining to transfer of name, inheritance, family division, and measurement.While releasing the tehsil-wise performance report in this regard, CM said the trend of 'date after date' in revenue promises cannot be accepted.He warned of action against revenue personnel like accountants, revenue inspectors and added that divisional commissioners and district magistrate too would be held accountable as per the requirement. 
His warning came in the wake of Deoria and Kaushambi where property disputes led to bloodbath.Yogi told DMs and SPs that field posting is the best opportunity for a public servant. "Every field posting should be done solely on the basis of merit. If any posting would be done on recommendation or under pressure then action would follow," he said.Giving information about the applications received at Janata Darshan in recent days and releasing the performance report of the IGRS, the CM said that officers are deployed for the public and meeting the public and solving their problems should be their top priority. "Officers/employees posted in the field who are not able to do this should leave the field posting immediately," he said.In the wake of upcoming festivals of Navratri, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali and Chhath, Yogi said, all staff- from beat constable to electricity in charge and every officer, including the district police chief, must remain in the field. The netizens must be assured of their assured security. CM added that due to planned efforts in the past years, loudspeakers installed at religious places were removed, but information about their re-installation is being received from some areas. "If obscene songs or loud music is played during the festivals and the guidelines of the Supreme Court are not met, then the district police chiefs will be held accountable," said the CM.Yogi also took the report from DMs regarding the preparations for Navratri fair in Balrampur, Saharanpur, Sitapur and Mirzapur and gave instructions in the interest of the devotees. He also said that every village and town must get adequate electricity during festivals."There should be no unnecessary deduction in the name of local fault or rostering. While giving instructions for fire safety in Durga pandals, he also instructed that firecracker shops be set up away from populated areas and that there be no delay in issuing licenses for these shops," the CM directed.Describing women's safety as the top priority of the government, the CM said that the fourth phase of Mission Shakti has an action plan for every department, and they should ensure action accordingly. Yogi said that during the special campaign of Mission Shakti, prabhat pheris of public awareness should be organized by involving students of basic and secondary education departments across the state.

'Doxxing truck': Names, faces of Harvard students put on mobile billboards for anti-Israel statement

A mobile billboard truck circled near Harvard's campus on Wednesday, featuring names and photos of Harvard students whose organizations had endorsed a statement attributing the deadly attacks by Hamas solely to Israel.This "doxxing truck" made an appearance following a recent statement from the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups, a coalition of student organizations, which squarely blamed "the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence." This statement was issued after attacks by Hamas resulted in the deaths of over 1,200 Israelis, including 25 Americans, and more than 1,400 in Gaza, prompting Israeli strikes in response.According to a CNN report, a conservative nonprofit organized the truck displaying virtual billboards featuring students' names and images under the banner "Harvard's Leading Antisemites."The president of the group responsible for the truck announced on X (formerly Twitter) that they were removing names of students from groups that withdrew while adding new names regularly.In response to the mounting criticism, at least eight of the original 34 co-signing Harvard student groups had withdrawn their support from the statement by Wednesday afternoon, as reported by the Harvard Crimson student newspaper.On X, hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman urged for students to be publicly identified so that he and other companies could avoid hiring them."One should not be allowed to shield themselves behind a corporate facade while endorsing the actions of terrorists," Ackman stated in his message. 
In response to Ackman, several CEOs expressed their support for his initiative to reveal the names of these students.Meanwhile, Harvard Executive Vice President Meredith L Weenick has criticized online intimidation and harassment. "I write tonight to assure you that the University takes seriously the safety and wellbeing of every member of our community. We do not condone or ignore intimidation. We do not condone or ignore threats or acts of harassment or violence," Weenick said in a statement.Renowned legal scholar Laurence Tribe, in an email to CNN, criticized the exposure of students, saying that naming and shaming, along with labeling them as antisemites and posting their photos, was more harmful than helpful. "We shouldn't repeat the McCarthy era's excesses in the interest of moral clarity," Tribe added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

CAIRO: US secretary of state Antony Blinken will return to Israel on Monday to talk "about the way forward" after several days of shuttle diplomacy between Arab states, which he said shared the US determination to ensure Israel's conflict with Palestinian militant group Hamas does not spillover elsewhere in the region. The top US diplomat arrived in Israel on Thursday and has also been to Qatar, Jordan, Bahrain, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. 
The conflict has raised international concern that it could spark a wider regional war as Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned on Sunday that "the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger".Binken met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh Sunday and then Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo, where he received a blunt assessment from Sisi of Israel's response to the Hamas attack. "The (Israeli) reaction went beyond the right to self-defence, turning into collective punishment for 2.3 million people in Gaza," Sisi told Blinken in televised re marks. Before departing for Cairo, Blinken described his talks with the Saudi crown prince, one of the most powerful leaders of the region, as "very productive". A US official said the meeting lasted for just under an hour. Blinken said in Cairo that the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza would reopen. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI:  At least nine American citizens were killed in the weekend after Hamas attacked Israel and other citizens were missing, the State Department said on Monday.Official word of Americans killed in the conflict came as Israel retaliated for the incursion, one of the bloodiest in its history, launching attacks on the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. Earlier an official said that the number was fluid and had ranged from between six to 12. It is not clear whether the missing had been taken hostage, were killed, or are in hiding.The State Department is in touch with families "and providing all appropriate consular assistance," said spokesman Matthew Miller.Meanwhile, eight French nationals were missing, confirmed dead or taken hostage after Hamas's weekend attack on Israel, a lawmaker said Monday.Paris "should hold Hamas directly responsible for (hostages') safety and use every means to secure their release," conservative MP Meyer Habib, who represents French people living abroad in a swathe of Mediterranean countries including Israel, wrote on X (formerly Twitter).Death toll from Hamas attack that began on Saturday rose to 800. Earlier, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said he has ordered a "complete siege" of the Gaza Strip, saying authorities would cut electricity and block the entry of food and fuel. 
He made the statement after an assessment at the IDF Southern Command in Beersheba.In a major escalation on October 7, Hamas launched a "surprise attack" on Israel, firing a barrage of rockets into the southern and central parts of the country.(Input from Agencies) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com
