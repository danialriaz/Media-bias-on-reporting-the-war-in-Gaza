Why has Jordan cancelled Biden visit after Israel bombing of Gaza hospital?

October 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
It was to be a centrepiece of United States President Joe Biden's visit to the Middle East on Wednesday: a trip to Jordan to meet a range of Arab leaders amid Israel's incessant bombing of the Gaza Strip.
But on Tuesday, Jordan cancelled that summit after an Israeli air strike hit the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, killing at least 500 people and sparking global outrage.
That decision underscored a complex history between Jordan and Israel that stretches back to the very founding of the latter state and continues to influenceregional dynamics.
The two neighbours spent decades officially at war but always maintained contact, which eventually led to the signing of a peace treaty in 1994. Yet their relationship has remained uneasy with the shadow of the Palestinian struggle for statehood and justice hanging over it.
Turning back the decades
More than 700,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their ancestral lands in 1948 by Jewish militias and Israeli forces in an event the Palestinians know as the Nakba, or 'catastrophe' in Arabic.
In the same year, shortly after a United Nations plan to partition Palestinian land at the end of a British mandate, a military coalition of Arab states which also included Jordan entered the territory to fight Israel.
By the end of the war, Jordan was in control of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
Jordan was also a key participant in the Six-Day War in 1967, having aligned itself with Egypt's then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser.
By the end of that war, which marked a major victory for Israeli forces, Jordan had lost control of both East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
Jordan and Israel, which were believed to have maintained backchannels even during times of war, signed a peace treaty in 1994. Jordan became the second Arab country after Egypt to  .
How did the treaty change things?
The peace treaty came about shortly after the first of the Oslo Accords in 1993, which established the Palestinian Authority. Israel and Jordan also signed a declaration at the US White House that committed them to end enmities and achieve lasting peace.
The peace deal increased security cooperation between the two countries and paved the way for setting up ambitious economic projects. So-called Qualifying Industrial Zones in Jordan allowed it to export duty-free commodities to the US if they had specified Israeli inputs. This arrangement later morphed into a free trade agreement between Jordan and the US.
Israel and Jordan reached an agreement to address the latter's considerable water concerns, committing Israel to share its water. In 2014, they signed a deal for gas from Israeli fields to be supplied to Jordan for a 15-year period.
Ebb and flow of relations
But the fact that the Palestinian issue remained unresolved, along with several high-profile incidents over the years, has affected relations.
A Jordanian soldier opened fire on a group of Israeli schoolgirls in 1997, killing seven.In the same year, Mossad agents who had been sent to Amman to assassinate Hamas political leader Khaled Mashal were caught. Jordan demanded that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hand over the antidote to the substance that was used to poison Mashal, but he did so only after then-US President Bill Clinton directly intervened.
More recently, a 17-year-old Palestinian in 2017 stabbed an off-duty security guard at the Israeli Embassy in Jordan, which prompted the security guard to shoot his weapon and kill the Palestinian and another man. The embassy was closed for six months and Netanyahu hailed the guard when he went back to Israel.
In late 2019, Jordan's King Abdullah II said relations with Israel were 'at an all-time low'.
Since then, relations appeared to have improved, with  , including the first visit by an Israeli president to Jordan last year.
Israel's war on Gaza could reverse that trend.
Jordan as custodian of Al-Aqsa
The Hashemite royal family of Jordan, which has ruled the country since 1921, has also served as the custodian of Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque for nearly a century.
In 1924, the Supreme Muslim Council, which was the highest body in charge of Muslim community affairs in British-controlled Palestine at the time, chose a member of the Hashemite dynasty as the custodian of the mosque. Al-Aqsa is among Islam's holiest sites and one of the oldest surviving examples of Islamic architecture.
The Jordanian royal family has renovated Al-Aqsa several times in the past century.
Jordan's concerns today
Yet today, Jordan also has more practical challenges too, as Israel's war on Gaza intensifies.
Jordan is   with Israel. Its relations with Israel and the US serve as a boost to its economy, which suffered a blow because of its dependence on tourismduring the COVID-19 pandemic.
But Jordan cannot afford to see the war escalate.
It has condemned Israel's bombing of Gaza and the   that have arisen as a result of it, consistent with its advocacy for the resolution of the Palestinian issue.
Already host to millions of migrants from Palestine, Syria and Iraq, Jordan is also highly wary of a new influx of Palestinian refugees, who have historically been driven out of their homelands by Israel to never be able to return.
Jordan has insisted that Palestinians need to remain in their homeland if they are to form a state of their own in the future.

Switzerland moves to ban Hamas, backs Israel's 'right to self-defence'

November 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Swiss government has announced it will introduce legislation by the end of February to explicitly ban "Hamas activities or support" for the Palestinian group.
The Federal Council, the executive branch, said on Wednesday that it has decided to draft a law to ban the Palestinian group "considering this to be the most appropriate response to the situation that has prevailed in the Middle East since October 7".
"The act will provide the federal authorities with the necessary tools to counter any Hamas activities or support for the organisation in Switzerland."
On  , Palestinian fighters from the Gaza Strip, which has been run by Hamas since 2007, launched an attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to the Israeli government.
Hamas and other Palestinian factions also took an estimated 240 Israelis and foreigners into the Gaza Strip as captives.
Since then, Israel has   a massive air and ground offensive on the beleaguered Strip, killing at least 14,319 people, including more than 5,000 children, local health authorities say.
Early on Wednesday, Israel and Hamas   on a Qatar-mediated deal for a four-day truce in Gaza and the release of 50 captives held in the enclave for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody, with negotiations ongoing on the timing.
The seven-member council is formed by ministers from the four largest parties, and lawmakers in parliament are likely to swing strongly behind the draft legislation, given the positions of the major parties.
The hard-right Swiss People's Party, the biggest in the country, has been strongly pushing for a ban.
On Wednesday, the government called for respect for international humanitarian law and particularly the protection of civilians. It voiced "deep sorrow for the thousands of civilians who have lost their lives in Israel and across the occupied Palestinian territories" and condemned the Hamas attack on October 7 "in the strongest possible terms".
The statement made no mention of Israel's actions in Gaza but recognised "Israel's right to ensure   and security".
"In view of the dramatic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, the Federal Council stresses the need to ensure unimpeded humanitarian access. Humanitarian pauses are necessary for this purpose," the statement added.
Bern reiterated the need to restore the prospect of a political framework in the region based on a two-state solution.
"This approach is the only viable path towards ensuring that both the Palestinian and Israeli populations can coexist peacefully, securely and with dignity," it said.
On October 11, the Federal Department for Foreign Affairs (FDFA) suspended millions of dollars in funding to six Palestinian and five Israeli civil society organisations with ongoing international cooperation partnerships with the Swiss government.
The 11 partner NGOs were subject to "in-depth verification of their compliance with the FDFA's code of conduct and the anti-discrimination clause in their contracts". As a result, three of the NGOs saw their contract with the government terminated.

Meta deletes Al Jazeera presenter's profile after show criticising Israel

September 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Al Jazeera Arabic presenter Tamer Almisshal has had his Facebook profile deleted by Meta 24 hours afterthe programme Tip of the Iceberg aired an investigation into Meta's censorship of Palestinian content titled The Locked Space .
The programme's investigation, which aired on Friday, included admissions by Eric Barbing, former head of Israel's cybersecurity apparatus, about his organisation's effort to track Palestinian content according to criteria that included "liking" a photo of a Palestinian killed by Israeli forces.
Then the agency would approach Facebook and argue that the content should be taken down.
According to Barbing, Facebook usually complies with the requests and Israel's security apparatus follows up cases, including bringing court cases if need be.
The investigation followed up on Barbing's admissions by interviewing a number of human and digital rights experts who agreed that there was a distinct imbalance in how Palestinian content is restricted.
The programme also interviewed Julie Owono, a member of Facebook's oversight board, who admitted there is a discrepancy in how rules are interpreted and applied to Palestinian content and added that recommendations had been sent to Facebook to correct this.
Al Jazeera has asked Facebook about why Almisshal's profile was shut down with no prior warning or explanation. It had not received a response by the time of publication.
'Targeting a journalist'
Almisshal said the profile that was deleted is his personal page, set up by him in 2006 and verified. He had at least 700,000 followers on it.
"After the huge success of the episode, I discovered that my personal Facebook profile had been deleted with no explanations given," he told Al Jazeera. "It really does seem like some kind of revenge for the programme. We haven't received any response from Facebook yet."
The programme's team had set out to investigate how wide the gap was between how Palestinian and Israeli posts and material are treated by Facebook.
To do that, it set up an experiment in which it built two different pages, one with a pro-Palestinian perspective and the other a pro-Israeli one, and ran trials on them. The team concluded that there was indeed a big discrepancy in how much scrutiny there is and how rules are applied to posts on either page.
A day after Tamer Almisshal, a Palestinian #journalist  with #Jazeera , presented shocking evidence of Meta's censorship of Palestinian content on its platforms during his Tip of the Iceberg TV show, Facebook has taken down his page. #IsraeliCrimes #Palestine pic.twitter.com/RGQm8sUuzQ
- Hadeel Abo Aita (@aita_hadeel) September 10, 2023
It is not clear why Facebook would choose to delete an individual's page in response to a programme.
"There was no explanation, no warning," Almisshal said. "There had been no issues with any of the content on my page before. No message saying I had violated any rules."
Almisshal stands by his programme.
"Last March, Facebook restricted my account, and it has happened other times, but usually the situation is resolved," he said. "This was a journalistically sound project, and we communicated with Meta for it, giving them the opportunity to speak during the investigation.
"But to target a journalist individually instead – I would never have expected that."

November 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gazan authorities say 15 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on the Bureij refugee camp, marking the third   in as many days.
A spokesperson for Gaza Civil Defence said the strike on Thursday in central Gaza hit a residential building, and residents reported scores of people trapped beneath the rubble.
'My family and I were sitting, and all of a sudden, we heard a huge explosive. Everything was flying around us. We couldn't see anything but dust and smoke. It was massive. The whole area is turned upside down all in a second,' a survivor told Al Jazeera.
'That was my home [pointing to rubble]. Now it is totally in ruins. I do not know what to say. We are helpless.'
Bureij is a comparatively small refugee camp situated in the middle of the Gaza Strip. It is home to about 46,000 Palestinian refugees who are registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).
Over the past several days, Israel has carried out   on refugee camps inside Gaza, often some of the most densely populated areas of the besieged enclave.
Israel says it is targeting commanders with the armed Palestinian group Hamas, which carried out   on southern Israel on October 7, which Israeli authorities said killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
But Israel's bombing campaign has come under scrutiny as it levels entire city blocks and   access to food, fuel and electricity for the strip's 2.3 million residents.
Palestinian authorities said more than 9,000 people have been killed in the bombings and more than half Gaza's population has been  .
In addition to the bombing of Bureij, Israel also struck the Jabalia camp for a third day in a row on Thursday. Palestinian authorities said Israeli strikes on Jabalia have thus far killed 195 people with 120 missing.
The UN high commissioner for human rights said such 'disproportionate attacks' may constitute  .
Residents of Bureij chanted 'a massacre, a massacre' as they covered the bodies of those killed in Thursday's strike with blankets.
Like many such camps in  , it was originally built for Palestinian refugees from villages depopulated by Zionist forces during the founding of Israel  , from which Palestinians were then barred from returning. The refugees who settled in Bureij mostly came from Palestinian towns east of Gaza.

October 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
On October 7, within hours of the armed group Hamas launching a surprise attack on Israel, social media platforms were rife with support for Israel – and also fake news.
What stood out in the clamour was the fact that a fair amount of it was produced and distributed by accounts  .
In the days after Israel declared war on Hamas, a blue-tick-verified handle posted a video on the social media platform X of a Pakistani parliamentarian  threatening to obliterate Israel with an 'atom bomb' if it did not end its atrocities against Muslims. That video received more than 840,000 views. But it was from 2021  and is not related to the current war.
Similarly, Suresh Chavhanke, editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, a right-wing channel, shared a clip on X of an Israeli representative tearing up a 20-page United Nations report documenting human rights violations. That too was from 2021 .
Experts say the Israel-Hamas war has given a massive reach to social media accounts in India – both large and small – that have managed to ride a wave of anti-Muslim and pro-Israel fervour.
Apoorvanand, a Delhi University professor who goes by one name, perceives a link between current 'anti-Muslim sentiment' and the rise of Hindu nationalist ideologies like Hindutva, particularly under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Hindutva supporters, he said, 'hold Muslims across countries responsible for all the ills and everything bad. They've started looking at Israel as an ideal, as a model to be followed because Israel does what it wants to do to Muslims'.
A 'generational shift' has taken place in India, said Nicolas Blarel, an associate professor of international relations at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
Over the last decade, Blarel has observed that the country has grown more fascinated with Israel, including how it defends itself against attacks from its neighbours.
That situation has particular resonance in India, according to Blarel. In addition to border incursions from China in the east, India has also been subject to attacks on its western flank by what it says are state-supported armed groups in Pakistan. The two nuclear-armed nations have been locked in an ongoing conflict for control of the disputed territory of Kashmir.
Those tense international relations have, in part, led Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to seek warmer relations with Israel.
'Terrorism is the thing that's brought the BJP closer to Israel over the last few years – how to better deal with counterterrorism,' said Blarel.
As a result, India's political sphere has transformed from 'an exclusive pro-Palestine ecosystem to the complete opposite and to one that is completely empathetic with [the] Israeli position' today, he explained.
Changing relationships
Indeed, India had supported Palestine's right to statehood since 1947, when it gained independence from the United Kingdom.
At the time, the United Nations had proposed a 'partition plan' to create separate Israeli and Palestinian states, something India objected to.
The plan never took effect, though. The very next year, Israel declared independence, sparking a conflict that would see the mass displacement of Palestinians.
Still, in 1974, India became the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the 'sole and legitimate representative' of the Palestinian people, continuing its pattern of support.
And while New Delhi formally recognised Israel in 1950, it only normalised diplomatic relations in the early 1990s. Even then, it remained committed to the Palestinian cause and continued nurturing its relations with the Muslim-majority nations in the Middle East.
However, in the past few years, India and Israel have started  . The attacks in India's financial capital Mumbai on November 26, 2008, helped spur the shift.
More than 160 people were killed and over 300 injured. A Jewish centre, the Nariman House, was among the targets: An Israeli American rabbi and his wife were among the six gunned down there. India blamed the attacks on a Pakistan-based armed group.
Trade and innovation have also drawn the two countries together. When Modi was chief minister of Gujarat, he displayed his fascination for Israeli technologies including drip irrigation and water desalination, both useful for his state.
Israel has also been a supplier of arms to India, including during its 1999 skirmish with Pakistan in the Kashmiri region of Kargil. Israeli surveillance drones and mortar shells helped India emerge victorious in that conflict.
More recently, India was one of the countries accused of having bought Pegasus spyware from the Israeli cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group. Critics accuse the Modi government of deploying the spyware against judges, journalists, activists and political leaders, among others.

Experts agree that the biggest shift in India's foreign policy towards Israel has happened since Modi came to power in 2014. He became the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel in 2017.
In the wake of the Hamas attack on October 7, Modi has issued strong declarations in support of Israel. He initially tweeted , 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with Israel.'
In a follow-up statement later that day, Modi added that 'India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations '.
But neither statement made any reference to the lives or plight of Palestinians. Only five days later did his government address the question of Palestinian relations: In response to a question during a routine media briefing, a spokesperson for the foreign minister said India's stance on Palestine had not changed.
'I was struck by Modi's response to express solidarity with Israel and say nothing about Palestine at all,' said Michael Kugelman, director of theSouth Asia Institute at theWilson Center think tank in Washington, DC. 'Because India's policy has been balanced so far.'
The statements showed 'total support for Israel to defend itself', according to Ashok Swain, head of the department of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University in Sweden.
While New Delhi is now trying to maintain a more balanced position, those early statements showed that Modi is more interested in getting votes and appealing to his right-wing constituency, Swain added.
They send the message that Muslims are 'the perpetrators of all sorts of crimes and less than human beings. They don't talk about the Gaza situation or even who created Hamas'.
Swain also sees the statements as a demonstration of the common ground Modi shares with far-right politicians in Israel.
'Hindu nationalists and Zionists have an ideological similarity: They want a strong state and a strong leader,' he explained. 'They also have a common factor – Islamophobia – which also binds them together.'
Support ratio of 5:1
Those tensions played out on social media in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war.
 
At Al Jazeera's request, the Narrative Research Lab in New Delhi scanned through trending hashtags and phrases in India on the social media platform X, to better understand how political narratives about the war were being shaped.
The phrase "We Indians" stood out partially because of the ongoing Cricket World Cup but also because of the conflict, said Sarabjot Singh, the lab's co-founder.
'We Indians' is an expression often invoked to stir nationalist pride. Using it as a keyword, Singh's co-founder Sundeep Narwani used artificial intelligence to analyse a total of 4,316 tweets, of which 2,200 included words about the Israel-Hamas war.
More than 1,250 were pro-Israel, and approximately 250 were pro-Palestine, indicating a five-to-one ratio in favour of Israel.
In an attempt to gauge social media chatter, the lab also analysed two hashtags: "#IstandwithIsrael" and "#IsraelPalestineWar". The former was used globally, but the lab found a 'substantial' number of Indian accounts using it.
'Issues that bring Modi and Netanyahu together are the same issues that make the Hindutva constituency in India gravitate towards Israel – admiring how Netanyahu has negotiated the neighbourhood with a strong stance,' said Kugelman.

A suspect has been arrested in what police say have called the "hate-motivated" shooting of three college students of Palestinian descent in the US state of Vermont.
Police in the city of Burlington arrested the 48-year-old suspect, identified as Jason J Eaton, on Sunday afternoon, according to US news reports.
The three victims, Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ahmed, were shot on Saturday evening near the University of Vermont's campus. The students, who attend different universities in the US, remain hospitalised with gunshot wounds.
The students, two of whom are American citizens and the third a legal resident, were visiting Burlington to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday with families.
Speaking Arabic
As more details of the attack emerge, police say they are investigating the shooting as a hate crime.
"In this charged moment, no one can look at this incident and not suspect that it may have been a hate-motivated crime," Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad said in a statement.
"That there is an indication that this shooting could have been motivated by hate is chilling, and this possibility is being prioritised" by police, Mayor Miro Weinberger said.
The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) stated that upon learning of the details of the shooting, the organisation had 'reason to believe [it] was motivated by the three victims being Arab'.
'According to the information provided, the three victims were wearing a keffiyeh and speaking Arabic. A man shouted and harassed the victims, then proceeded to shoot them,' the group said in a statement.
This morning, ADC was contacted about the shooting, after reviewing the information, we have reason to believe that the shooting was motivated by the three vitims being Arab.

'Given the information collected and provided, it is clear that hate was a motivating factor in this shooting,' said ADC's Director Abed Ayoub.
Rise in hateful sentiments
The incident came amid a   in the US, with both Republican and Democratic politicians backing Israel's  , despite the mounting Palestinian death toll and growing accusations of war crimes.
"The surge in anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian sentiment we are experiencing is unprecedented, and this is another example of that hate turning violent," Ayoub said.
The victims' families issued a joint statement urging authorities to investigate the shooting as a hate crime. 'We need to ensure that our children are protected, and this heinous crime is not repeated. No family should ever have to endure this pain and agony,' they said.
Six-year-old Palestinian-American Wadea Al-Fayoume was killed when he was stabbed 26 times by his landlord in a suspected hate crime in the US state of Illinois last month.
Israel's ground and air assault on the besieged Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, and left vast swathes of the enclave in ruins. The war was sparked when Hamas, the group that governs the enclave, attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 and taking around 250 hostages.

Hamas says will kill hostages if Israeli attacks on Gaza civilians continue

The Hamas movement has threatened to kill an Israeli hostage every time Israel bombs a Palestinian home without warning as Israel mobilised some 300,000 reservists and imposed a total blockade of the Gaza Strip denying the enclave's millions of residents access to food, water and fuel.
The warning from Hamas came on Monday as the death toll from the armed group's surprise weekend attack  and revenge attacks by Israeli forces on the besieged Gaza Strip killed almost 700 people and left more than 3,700 wounded.
Residential apartment blocks, hospitals, schools and a mosque have been among the sites attacked by Israeli jet fighters, artillery and drones, according to media reports and witnesses.
Hamas spokesperson Abu Ubaida issued the threat on Monday to kill Israelis among the   by the armed group. He said an Israeli hostage would be killed for every Israeli bombing of a civilian house without warning.
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said more than 100 people were taken captive by Hamas during the deadly cross-border incursion over the weekend.
As Israeli forces conducted intense retaliatory attacks on Gaza on Monday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant drew international condemnation by announcing a total blockade of the densely populated and besieged enclave, which home to 2.3 million people.
Gallant said Israel would impose a "complete siege" on Gaza: "No electricity, no food, no water, no gas – it's all closed."
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was "deeply distressed" by the siege announcement and warned that Gaza's already dire humanitarian situation will now "only deteriorate exponentially".

Guterres also said some 137,000 people were taking shelter with UNRWA, the UN agency that provides essential services to Palestinians.
Human Rights Watch said Israel's total blockade on the necessities of life for everyday people in Gaza was a war crime.
'Defense Minister Gallant's statements are abhorrent," Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
"Depriving the population in an occupied territory of food and electricity is collective punishment, which is a war crime, as is using starvation as a weapon of war. The International Criminal Court should take note of this call to commit a war crime,' he said.
Abhorrent. This is a call to commit a war crime by @yoavgallant . The @IntlCrimCourt  should take note.

Shakir also condemned the threat by Hamas to kill hostages, warning that such action was also a war crime.
"All hostages should be safely released to their families," he said.
Grotesque. These threatened acts would amount to flagrant war crimes by Hamas' armed wing. The @IntlCrimCourt  will be watching.

On the diplomatic front, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Recep Erdogan called on Hamas and Israel to immediately end violence and protect civilians, the Egyptian presidency said.
Erdogan urged Israel against "indiscriminately" attacking civilians and delivered measured criticism of Hamas, urging both sides to respect the "ethics" of war.
The United Kingdom, French, German, Italian and US governments issued a joint statement on Monday recognising the "legitimate aspirations" of the Palestinian people and supporting equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike.
They also said they would remain "united and coordinated" to ensure Israel can defend itself.
But the prospect that fighting could spread also alarmed the region and the world.
Lebanese armed group Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel in response to at least three of its members being killed in Israeli shelling of Lebanon.
Israel also said one of its deputy commanders was killed in an earlier cross-border raid from Lebanon.

Australian ex-PMs condemn Hamas, urge Israel to avoid civilian deaths

All but one of Australia's living ex-prime ministers have joined together to condemn Hamas, urge Israel to avoid civilian casualties and express solidarity with Jewish and Palestinian Australians.
In a joint statement published on Monday, the six former leaders said there was no place for racial or religious hatred in Australia and warned against allowing the Israel-Hamas war to 'turn Australians against each other'.
'We believe we speak for the vast majority of Australians, of all faiths and of none, when we say we stand in solidarity with Jewish Australians at this time,' the former leaders said.
"Likewise, we stand too with the Australian Palestinian community whose families are dying and suffering in this terrible conflict. They too deserve our love and support."
The former prime ministers condemned Hamas's October 7 attacks as a 'cruel and murderous attack'.
'It was the single greatest massacre of Jewish since the Holocaust and its grotesque cruelty and violence was comparable to that of ISIS,' the statement said, referring to the ISIL armed group.
They also accused Hamas of seeking to provoke a 'reaction that would kill countless civilians' in Gaza and having 'no more interest in the safety of Palestinians than do they of Israelis'.

But the former Australian leaders also said Israel's war against Hamas must be accompanied by 'support and protection for the civilian population of Gaza".
'Israel promises it will do all it can to avoid civilian casualties, we urge it to do so with all of its humanity and skill,' they said.
"We are horrified by the thousands of deaths and injuries inflicted on innocent Palestinian civilians, including many, many Palestinian children."
Scott Morrison, Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott, John Howard, Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd – former leaders from both the centre-right Liberal Party and centre-left Labor Party – put their names to the statement.
Paul Keating, who governed Australia from 1991 to 1996 under Labor, did not join his fellow ex-prime ministers.
Keating said in a statement on Sunday that he had declined to add his name after being approached by Mark Leibler, the former president of the Zionist Federation of Australia, without providing further details.
Australia's current government, led by Anthony Albanese, has acknowledged Israel's right to defend itself while calling on all sides to show restraint to protect civilian life.
Some Labor politicians, however, have broken ranks to condemn Israel's bombardment of Gaza.
On Friday, Australia abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza –   – arguing it was 'incomplete' because it did not name Hamas.
At least 8,005 Palestinians, including more than 3,200 children, have been killed in Israeli air raids on Gaza, according to authorities in the Hamas-governed enclave.
At least 1,405 people were killed in Hamas's surprise attack inside southern Israel, according to Israeli officials.

Why Egypt-Gaza Rafah crossing vital for supplying aid amid Israeli strikes?

As the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip continues, 2.3 million Palestinians remain trapped as Israel announced a total blockade of the enclave – no water, no fuel and no electricity – in the wake of Hamas's deadly attack on October 7.
Efforts to open the Rafah crossing have so far not yielded any results, with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry saying Israel has yet to allow the opening of the crossing, which connects Gaza to Egypt. He added that Cairo aimed to keep the crossing operational.
Egypt is expected to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance to beleaguered Palestinians in the enclave but has rejected proposals to accept Gaza Palestinians into its borders.
So, what is the crossing that Egypt controls, how is Egypt tied to Gaza amid the continuing conflict and what happens next?
What is the Rafah crossing?
About a million Palestinians have already been displaced as a result of intense Israeli bombing, and an Israeli order to evacuate northern Gaza in preparation for an apparent ground offensive.
Tens of thousands of people have been sheltering in UN schools while the medical situation is at breaking point.
The Rafah crossing, located in the southern part of Gaza bordering Egypt's Sinai peninsula, is the only way Palestinians can get out of Gaza and aid can enter since Israel has imposed a total siege on the enclave.
Both Israel and Egypt enforce strict control over the passage of people and goods as part of an earlier blockade imposed in 2007 after Hamas came to power.
The crossing is increasingly coming up in negotiations between different parties as they try to navigate the war that erupted on October 7 when Hamas fighters entered Israel and began launching rockets, killing at least 1,400 people so far. Israel has since killed at least 2,700 Palestinians in a relentless bombing campaign in the past eight days.
Rafah was closed after the start of the conflict, as  . Egypt claims its own side of the crossing remains operational, but the Israeli air strikes have significantly damaged infrastructure on the Palestinian side.
Hundreds of tonnes of aid from NGOs and several countries were waiting on trucks in the nearby Egyptian town of El Arish on Monday for permission to enter Gaza, two sources there and a witness told Reuters.
Egypt's Sinai peninsula and Gaza
The Sinai peninsula, which also borders Israel, is located between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south. As the only part of Egypt to be located in Asia, it acts as a land bridge between Asia and Africa.
The Sinai was controlled by the Ottoman Empire for centuries until the 19th century, subsequently falling into the hands of the British colonial power, which maintained control till the mid-20th century.
Sinai was captured by Israel in the wake of the Six-Day War with Arab states in 1967. Israel returned Sinai to Egypt after the Camp David Accords brokered by the United States. Egypt became the first Arab nation to officially recognise Israel as part of the peace deals. Israel fully withdrew from the Sinai peninsula by 1982.
The Gaza Strip, which was under Egyptian control from 1948 to 1967, came under Israeli occupation. Israel would maintain its hold over Gaza for about 40 years before withdrawing under international pressure in 2005.
What about aid and refugees?
Hundreds of tonnes of aid on more than 100 trucks has arrived in Sinai from countries including Jordan and Turkey, with Egypt opening up its airport in El Arish to accommodate them.
The trucks are lined up in the northern parts of the peninsula close to Gaza and are ready to enter through the Rafah crossing once an agreement is reached to open it.
But despite visits by top United States and European officials to Egypt, Israel  , so the crossing remains closed.
That has meant that foreigners and dual-national Palestinians trapped in the blockaded enclave have also been unable to cross into Egypt, pending an agreement.
The situation is different for Palestinians without any other nationalities, as it appears Egypt does not plan to allow them entry based on national security considerations.
Egypt, which hosts about nine million migrants already from Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Libya and elsewhere, and on top of that is facing an economic crisis, is   to hundreds of thousands of more refugees.
That is especially true since historically, displaced Palestinians have been largely unable to return to their homes. Most of Gaza's population are refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when they were ethnically cleansed from their homes which now form part of Israel.
Both Egypt and Jordan have said Palestinians need to remain in their homeland to be able to achieve their goal of having a Palestinian state.

'In Derna, death is everywhere': Palestinian Civil Defence mission to Libya

When Raed Qazmouz and his team of Palestinian first responders finally reached Derna last week, he was stunned by the sheer scale of disaster in Libya's flooded Mediterranean city.
The 41-year-old lieutenant colonel is the head of the Palestinian Civil Defence rescue team, whose 35 members had completed their week-long mission in Derna on Thursday and were on their way back to the occupied West Bank.
"The devastation is beyond all imagination," he said, describing buildings uprooted from their foundations and swept out to sea.
This was not Qazmouz's first mission, as he led first response missions to Pakistan after major floods in 2022, and to Turkey after the earthquakes in February. But the shock felt in Derna by him and his team – which included 22 water search-and-rescue specialists – was palpable.

"The people here told us Derna was the most beautiful city in Libya," he said.
"Today, you walk through it and see nothing but mud, silt, and demolished houses. The smell of corpses is everywhere, the smell of death from the sea, where thousands of decomposed corpses have been swept away."
'We answer the call'
That a Palestinian mission had arrived to help disaster-stricken Libyans came as a surprise to many, and this team of first responders had to fight harder than others to even be able to get out of the occupied West Bank and to an international airport in Jordan.
Yet they persevered, Qazmouz said, because of abelief in international humanitarian principles and the necessity of providing humanitarian assistance to those in need, regardless of gender, religion, or race.
"When we hear a call for help from anyone, we answer the call, in spite of the suffering we experience as Palestinians living under Israeli occupation," he said.
Derna and other eastern Libyan cities were struck by   on September 10. The heavy rains caused the  , resulting in a wall of an estimated 30 million cubic metres (8 billion gallons) of water bombing through Derna,  .
(Al Jazeera)
A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said fatalities are in the thousands, but did not give a specific toll since the tally is still unclear. The World Health Organization says a total of 3,958 deaths have been registered.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says at least 9,000 people are still missing. Estimates are that tens of thousands of the city's 100,000 people have been displaced.
"An estimated 43,059 individuals have been displaced by the floods in northeastern Libya," the International Organization for Migration said on Thursday, adding that a "lack of water supply is reportedly driving many displaced out of Derna".
The Palestinian Civil Defence mission has worked in 56 countries across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America.
Bringing tonnes of aid to Libya
The Palestinian Civil Defence purchased more than 22 tonnes of food and humanitarian aid and presented it to the Libyan authorities, Imad al-Zuhairi, assistant minister of foreign affairs and director general of the Palestinian International Cooperation Agency, who was with the mission, told Al Jazeera.
"[D]espite the occupation, Palestine is capable of playing its role on the international stage," he said. "Our team's mission stems from us being able to relate closely to the suffering of others, given that we live under Israeli occupation and its policies."
Due to Israeli restrictions on Palestinian travel, it took the mission more than 30 hours to reach Derna [Courtesy: Palestinian Civil Defence]
Al-Zuhairi said their travel was hindered by the lack of direct flights and the team was delayed by a few days given that their overall travel time was more than 30 hours. But they were glad to have made it in the end.
"If we had an airport or port, we could have been there in a few hours," he said, adding that other international teams were able to go directly to their airports with all their equipment and supplies.
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are banned by Israel from using any of its airports and have to cross the Israeli-controlled land border with Jordan, drive to the capital Amman, and fly out of the Queen Alia International Airport.
'Whole families, wiped from civil registry'
Upon their arrival, the team set up two shifts to work from 7am to 7pm. "We wanted to work overnight, but search-and-rescue operations stopped completely at night," al-Zuhairi said.
He described tragic scenes of people searching for victims, regardless of whether they were alive or dead, adding that he had never seen such scenes of destruction, even in Turkey in the aftermath of February's earthquakes.
"I saw a completely destroyed city," he said. "I saw cars on the roofs of buildings, bodies on the ground, and bodies coming out of the sea."

Qazmouz said the city felt eerie, with entire families dead, "erased from the civil registry".
"Walking around Derna, you see death everywhere," he said. "We found victims in neighbourhoods they didn't live in, swept up by the floods, buried underground or swept out to sea."
Some bodies had been in the water so long, Qazmouz went on to say, it was difficult to identify the victims.
"We gave everything we could," he said. "Hopefully, we were part of alleviating some effects of this disaster on the afflicted Libyan people."

Clashes betweenPalestinian factions resume in Lebanon's Ein el-Hilweh camp

Clashes between rival factions have resumed in Lebanon's largest Palestinian refugee camp, with heavy gunfire and shelling wounding at least 20 people and prompting residents of the camp and the surrounding area to flee.
Reporting from outside the Ein el-Hilweh camp on Friday, Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr said dozens of families had escaped the fighting overnight between members of the Fatah movement and hardline groups and were now sleeping in the courtyard of a mosque.
"Children are telling us that they managed to escape in an ambulance but the ambulance came under fire," she said. "Mothers are saying that their children were screaming."
Khodr said the fighting in the camp, which is about one square kilometre and houses more than 63,000 registered refugees, is part of a decades-long struggle for power and control between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah and the armed groups, which call themselves the Muslim Youth.

There had previously been   in the Ein el-Hilweh camp between the factions after Fatah accused the groups of shooting dead one of their military generals on July 30.
Those street battles left at least 13 dead and dozens wounded, and forced hundreds to flee from their homes.
An uneasy truce has been in place since August 3, but clashes were widely expected to resume as the groups have not handed over the accused killers of the Fatah general, Mohammad "Abu Ashraf" al-Armoushi to the Lebanese judiciary as demanded by a committee of Palestinian factions earlier this month.
A committee of Palestinian factions in Ein el-Hilweh announced on Tuesday that their joint security forces would launch raids in search of the accused killers.
Khodr said residents had been living in fear "because for them it wasn't a question of if but of when there would be a new bout of violence".
Maher Shabaita, head of Fatah in the Sidon region, told The Associated Press news agency that the groups had launched an attack Thursday night in an attempt to forestall plans by Palestinian forces to clear armed fighters out of schools they had been  .
By late morning on Friday, the fighting had at least temporarily subsided.
Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported 20 people were wounded, including an elderly man, and transported to hospitals overnight. Shabaita said the wounded included three civil defence volunteers who came under shelling as they were working to extinguish fires.
There were no immediate reports of deaths. The public Lebanese University announced it would close its branches in the city of Sidon, which is adjacent to the camp, and postpone scheduled exams in light of the fighting.
Ein al-Hilweh, which was created for Palestinians who were forcibly displaced by Zionist paramilitaries in the run-up to Israel's establishment in 1948, is now an overcrowded neighbourhood of Sidon.
Thousands of Palestinians who sought refuge from the war in neighbouring Syria have also joined the camp in recent years.
By long-standing convention, the army does not enter Palestinian refugee camps – now bustling but impoverished urban districts – leaving the factions themselves to handle security.
Officials with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, could not immediately give information on the number of casualties or displaced.
UNRWA appealed last week for $15.5m to repair infrastructure damaged in the last round of clashes in the camp, provide alternative education locations for children whose schools were damaged or occupied by fighters, and give cash assistance to people who have been displaced from their homes.

TikTok faces renewed calls for a ban amid pro-Hamas, anti-Israel claims

November 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
After coming under fire for its links to China, TikTok is again under the spotlight in the United States amid claims that the popular video app is pushing young people to support Palestinians and Hamas.
Over the past two weeks, powerful politicians, including senators Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio and House Representative Mike Gallagher, have reiterated calls for a ban on TikTok, citing the app's alleged bias towards anti-Israel and anti-Jewish content.
'While data security issues are paramount, less often discussed is TikTok's power to radically distort the world picture that America's young people encounter. Israel's unfolding war with Hamas is a crucial test case,' Hawley said in a letter to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday.
Hawley cited a recent Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll in which 51 percent of Americans aged 18-24 said that Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel could be justified by Palestinians' grievances, in contrast to older Americans who overwhelmingly back Israel.
'Analysts have attributed this disparity to the ubiquity of anti-Israel content on TikTok, where most young internet users get their information about the world,' Hawley said.
Rubio said last month that TikTok was among a number of platforms that had become 'cesspools of [pro-Hamas] misinformation and indoctrination' and a vehicle for 'brainwashing'.

TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has long been in the crosshairs of US lawmakers over   including by suppressing content on sensitive issues like Taiwan and the repression of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang.
Democrats and Republicans introduced several bills aimed at banning or restricting TikTok, but those efforts have stalled due to free speech concerns.
Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, TikTok's influence has been thrust back into the public arena amid scrutiny of the prominence of pro-Palestinian content.
Last month, American venture capitalist Jeff Morris Jr wrote a lengthy series of posts on X alleging that the app's algorithm was corrupting young people by swaying them from the traditionally pro-Israel stance of most Americans.
Morris Jr expressed alarm that the hashtag '#standwithpalestine' had three billion views, compared with 200 million for '#standwithisrael'.
'When I engaged with one post on TikTok supporting opposing views, my entire feed became aggressively anti-Israel,' he said, adding it was as if he was 'told to see this war with Israel being the evil side'.
'Because the TikTok narrative is now so anti-Israel, the engagement flywheel encourages creators to support that narrative because it's getting the most attention, and creating anti-Israel content helps them increase their following.'
Duelling hashtags
TikTok did not provide a comment when contacted by Al Jazeera but has previously stated that it 'stands against terrorism' and removes hateful and violent content.
TikTok said in a statement last week that it had removed more than 925,000 videos in the conflict region for 'violating our policies around violence, hate speech, misinformation, and terrorism, including content promoting Hamas', and millions of more posts globally.
TikTok's publicly viewable user data suggest a greater affinity for the Palestinian cause among users in the US, although pro-Israel content is also popular on the site.
In the 30 days leading up to November 8, about 6,000 posts with 55 million views used the hashtag #standwithisrael, whereas some 13,000 posts with 37 million views used #standwithpalestine.
The hashtag #freepalestine dwarfed both, being featured in 177,000 posts with 946 million views.
None of the hashtags about the conflict cracked the top 100 over the period, during which the app was dominated by content related to Halloween, a meme about Ohio, and the film adaption of the video game Five Nights at Freddy's.
Globally, pro-Palestine content overwhelmingly dominated with #freepalestine and #standwithpalestine racking up 11 billion and one billion views, respectively.
'TikTok needs to get more serious about content moderation,' Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Governance Studies Center for Technology at the Brookings Institution, told Al Jazeera.
'Disinformation is being spread through videos on its platforms and inflaming public tensions on all sides of the issue. It needs human moderators who check the authenticity of the videos and make sure blatant lies are not being spread.'
There has been a rise in pro-Palestinian activism at US universities [File: Brian Snyder/Reuters]
In the US, the tilt towards pro-Palestinian content appears to reflect a generational shift that has been under way since well before the Israel-Hamas war.
In a 2022 survey by Pew Research, 61 percent of Americans aged 18-29 years said they viewed Palestinian people either 'very favourably' or 'somewhat favourably', compared with the national average of 52 percent.
When asked the same questions about Israelis, 56 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds said they viewed them favourably versus the average of 67 percent.
The rise in pro-Palestinian sentiment has been an especially fraught issue on university campuses, where divestment and boycott campaigns directed at Israel are popular.
The Anti-Defamation League reported 665 'anti-Israel incidents' on campuses from June 2022 to May 2023 and has expressed concern about a 'growing, radical movement to place opposition of Israel and Zionism as core elements of college life'.
Last month, student groups at Harvard University sparked a backlash after releasing a letter saying that Israel was 'entirely responsible for all unfolding violence' due to its treatment of the Palestinians.
Three law students at Harvard and Columbia University who signed the letter lost job offers following the controversy.
Edward Ahmed Mitchell, the national deputy director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that while there are legitimate concerns about TikTok, the prominence of pro-Palestinian content on the platform is not among them.
'It is nothing short of hypocritical for politicians to want to restrict access to a social media platform because it dares to allow people to freely express their support for Palestinian human rights in a way that other social media platforms do not,' Mitchell told Al Jazeera.
'Young people have also been exposed to the world and receive their news directly through social media in many cases - not through the filter of mainstream media,' he added.
'Therefore, if you have young people growing up for 10 years learning about Palestine directly from the victims of these continuous human rights violations, it's no surprise that people are more sympathetic to the Palestinian people.'

Analysis: Is the US approach to Gaza damaging ties with its Arab allies?

The United States'   for Israel's all-out assault on Gaza is undermining its relationships with its Arab allies and risks doing long-term damage to its standing in the region, analysts say.
Perennial US allies such as Jordan  have openly criticised what they see as Washington's green light for Israel to do as it sees fit in Gaza after more than   were killed following an attack by the armed wing of the Palestinian group  , and fighters took some   captive, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has responded by pounding the Palestinian enclave of Gaza with air raids that have already killed more than  . It is widely expected to launch a  .
For its part, the US is 'increasingly pushing behind the scenes for better Israeli decision-making, but it's also providing weapons to Israel carte blanche', said Josh Paul, a former senior official at the Department of State who publicly quit his post last week in protest at the strategy.
'Washington is giving unambiguous and unquestioned military support to Israel despite what many in the region see as a deep injustice. We have tried to frame ourselves as an honest broker, but we're removing what little credibility we had left in that role,' he told Al Jazeera.
When US President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, he pledged the US's full support, although he also negotiated a   Gaza and warned Israelis not to be '  ' by rage.
He also   that Palestinians were to blame for a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza, although the main video evidence  for that has been debunked and controversy is still raging over who was responsible.
Biden on Friday made a speech from the White House saying he had asked Congress for even   to Israel, barely mentioning the spiralling Palestinian death toll except to accuse Hamas  of using 'Palestinian civilians as human shields'.
'Double standards'
In an impassioned speech at a Cairo summit on Saturday to discuss de-escalation,   said the message Arabs were hearing from the West was 'loud and clear'.
'Palestinian lives matter less than Israeli ones. Our lives matter less than other lives. The application of international law is optional. And human rights have boundaries – they stop at borders, they stop at races, and they stop at religions,' he said.
His remarks, delivered in English as a message to Western leaders, echoed the feelings of many in the region where blanket US support for an occupying power is seen as particularly troublesome given Washington's backing of Ukraine since Russia invaded it early last year.
Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs research institution, told Al Jazeera that 'the level of double standards and hypocrisy coming out of the West is hitting home at a more fundamental level than before.
'There has always been a double standard when it came to Israel, but in the last two years, it has become a lot starker in light of the Ukraine conflict. That contrast has been particularly obvious over the past two weeks.'
Even before the Cairo peace summit, Jordan had   with Biden and the Egyptian and Palestinian Authority leaders to discuss Gaza until the parties could agree to end the 'war and the massacres against Palestinians', blaming Israel for pushing the region to 'the brink of the abyss'.
Speaking at a press conference at the United Nations on Tuesday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry also slammed Western 'double standards' over Israel's actions, saying that the suffering it is causing Palestinian civilians is not 'self-defence'. Meanwhile, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told the Security Council that the world must take "a firm stand to end the military operations".

Protests
Rahman said Arab governments needed to maintain ties with the US but also avoid being seen as complicit with an onslaught that has brought tens of thousands of   from Iraq to Morocco.
'Arab leaders also have an eye to their own publics, who are visibly angry and voicing discontent on the streets,' Rahman said.
'People are fed up with this [American] support in the face of what Israel's doing now," he said. "It's not only a threat to Palestinian lives en masse but also a threat to regional stability.'
The potential for unrest could be seen in Egypt on Friday when the administration of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi   at Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square in solidarity with Gaza.
Some protesters were filmed shouting slogans from the Arab Spring protests that led to the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.
The anger is not only in Arab capitals.
Over the weekend, HuffPost reported that a 'mutiny' was brewing at the State Department where staff were preparing a rare 'dissent cable' of internal criticism delivered to senior officials at moments of crisis.
That report came days after Paul resigned over what he called an 'impulsive' and 'immensely disappointing' policy, warning against 'blind support for one side'.

Side-stepping the conflict
Speaking to Al Jazeera this week, Paul said the Biden administration's attempt to side-step the Palestinian issue even prior to the latest conflict is counterproductive.
Since taking office, Biden has sought to roll back US engagement with the Middle East, while working to broker a deal with Saudi Arabia similar to the Abraham Accords that the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed in 2020 normalising ties with Israel.
The drive for such a deal, which Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman   would 'need to solve' the Palestinian issue, is now firmly on ice.
'The strategy it has been pursuing, building on the Trump administration's Abraham Accords, is misguided,' Paul said.
It 'assumes one can build on them without having to worry about the Palestinian question. But we've seen that there's no way of avoiding the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the civil and human rights of the Palestinian people,' he said.
'The current path will simply lead to more suffering, death and insecurity for both Palestinians and Israelis.'
James Ryan, director of research and the Middle East Program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI), said that the US strategy was 'short-termist'.
'There can be no stable normalisation without a political solution to the Palestinian question, so when this conflict reared its head, it showed the short-sightedness and superficiality of that strategy,' he said.
In an analysis  from last year, Ryan noted that Biden's national security strategy, which involves normalisation efforts in the Middle East, emphasises 'stability, however authoritarian, rather than rights.'
And while previous wars in Gaza have stirred similar levels of anger, Rahman noted that this time there was a 'fundamental difference' in terms of the effect on US standing in the region.
'The standing of the US as the world's sole superpower is in decline, and with that its allies are acting more autonomously, taking more assertive postures and balancing their ties with other rising powers like China,' he said.
'We're at a reckoning. That doesn't mean the US is 'just another country' – obviously, it's still one of most powerful – but there's a challenge to that.'

US Visa Waiver Program: Why Arab Americans angered by Israel's admission

September 28th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC – The Biden administration's decision to allow Israelis to   to the United States has drawn the ire of Arab Americans who say the move represents tacit approval of Israeli discrimination against US Palestinian and Arab travellers.
The US admitted Israel on Wednesday into the selective Visa Waiver Program (VWP), hailing the relationship between the two top allies.
The VWP requires admitted nations to abide by what's known as "reciprocity". This means that countries whose nationals are allowed to travel to the US without visas must, in turn, not discriminate or deny entry to American citizens without credible cause.
In this case, however, Palestinian rights supporters say the US will allow Israel's citizens to enter the country without a visa while the Israeli government   and turns back American travellers.
Activists argued that by adding Israel to the VWP, the US was overlooking well-documented Israeli discrimination against Americans of Arab and Palestinian descent, as well as supporters of Palestinian human rights more broadly.
For example, Israel   US Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib to visit the country and the occupied Palestinian territories in 2019, citing 'their boycott activities against Israel'.
James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, a Washington, DC-based think tank, said the US is deprioritising the rights of its own citizens.
"This was about us. It was about Arab Americans and our rights," said Zogby. "I feel betrayed by my government because they knowingly threw us under the bus."
What has the US said?
US officials have often stressed that "blue is blue", referring to the colour of the American passport and the privileges it entails.
Reciprocity is a key element of US travel policies; Washington even imposes visa fees on citizens of countries that charge American citizens for visas.
In a statement on Wednesday, Washington said Israel had met the reciprocity requirement.
"Israel made updates to its entry policies to meet the VWP requirement to extend reciprocal privileges to all US citizens without regard to national origin, religion, or ethnicity," US government agencies said.
But activists say Israel was handed the perks of the VWP in disregard of its mistreatment of American citizens and in violation of US laws.
For example, Americans residing in Gaza will still need a special permit from the Israeli authorities to leave the besieged territory – an arrangement that does not exist for any other country in the programme.
Pressed on the issue on Wednesday, Department of State spokesperson   acknowledged that there "are different procedures" for Gaza, saying that the territory is controlled by a "foreign terrorist organisation", referring to the Palestinian movement Hamas.
But he insisted that Israel still meets the reciprocity requirement.
'No respect for us'
Further angering many Arab Americans is the fact that Biden administration officials did not merely accept Israel into the programme.
They actively and publicly pushed for its inclusion in a campaign largely led by Thomas Nides, Washington's former envoy to Israel, who frequently posted about the effort on social media  over the past two years.
Moreover, activists said that the VWP inclusion handed a political victory to one of the most right-wing governments in Israeli history under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Zogby said US President Joe Biden's push   on Israel is difficult to understand. "I'm insulted, and I'm angry," he added.
He told Al Jazeera that he has himself been held and questioned for hours at Israeli checkpoints, even when accompanying American officials in the region.
"They have no respect for us," Zogby said of Israel. "And now our own government says in effect they don't respect us. That's the problem."
Israel's entry into the VWP also came amid growing concerns about the safety of US citizens in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories and the   from Washington to abuses against them.
Israeli forces killed two US citizens last year: renowned Al Jazeera journalist   and an elderly Palestinian-American man,  .
Here's how other Arab Americans, Palestinian rights advocates and US lawmakers responded to the decision to add Israel to the VWP this week:
Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib
"This decision enables further racist practices and violence towards Americans including the murder of  . The United States has yet to hold the Israeli government accountable.
"The Visa Waiver Program requires that all US citizens are treated equally. I have received consistent reports of discrimination of Americans attempting to enter Israel."

Mohammed Khader, US Campaign for Palestinian Rights advocacy group
'The Biden Administration's designation of Israel to be admitted into the Visa Waiver Program is a heinous lapse of oversight that relegates US law below Israeli law and exchanges the rights of US citizens for closer ties with an apartheid state that arms authoritarian governments abroad.'
IfNotNow, progressive Jewish-American group
"By admitting Israel to the Visa Waiver Program, the United States is essentially condoning Israel's apartheid regime over Palestinians by signing off on Israel's discrimination against Palestinian American citizens."
Adam Shapiro, Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN)

Three Palestinian rights groups have filed a lawsuit with the International Criminal Court (ICC), urging the body to investigate Israel for "apartheid" as well as "genocide" and issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders.
The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday by human rights organisations Al-Haq, Al Mezan, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, called for 'urgent attention to the continuous barrage of Israeli airstrikes on densely populated civilian areas within the Gaza Strip', which have killed more than 10,500 Palestinians, almost half of them children, according to Gaza health officials.
The document also asked the body to expand its ongoing war crimes investigation by looking into 'the suffocating siege imposed on [Gaza], the forced displacement of its population, the use of toxic gas, and the denial of necessities, such as food, water, fuel, and electricity'.
These acts amount to 'war crimes' and 'crimes against humanity', including "genocide', the lawsuit said.
The three groups want arrest warrants to be issued against Israel's President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.
The ICC's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP)   an official investigation into the situation in Palestine in 2021 after determining that 'war crimes have been or are being committed by Palestinian and Israeli actors in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip'.
However, the group has faced criticism from rights groups and activists who say its response to ongoing Israeli attacks in Gaza have been tepid.
In the latest ICC filing, the rights groups' lawyer, Emmanuel Daoud, referenced the ICC's   Russia's President Vladimir Putin for war crimes in Ukraine, and said there was 'no room for double standards in international justice'.
'Whether war crimes are committed in Ukraine or Palestine, the culprits should be held to account,' said Daoud.
This is not the first time a file against Israel has been brought to the ICC during its one-month war in Gaza.
On October 31, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) submitted a complaint to the body alleging Israel had perpetrated war crimes against journalists in Gaza.
As of Thursday, Israeli attacks have killed at least 39 journalists since October 7, according to figures from press freedom group Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), 34 of whom were Palestinian, four were Israeli, and one was Lebanese.
'Criminal responsibility'
ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan   additional possible crimes when he visited Egypt's Rafah border crossing on October 29, saying impeding humanitarian aid from reaching civilians could be prosecuted under the Rome Statute.
'There should not be any impediment to humanitarian relief supplies going to children, to women and men, civilians,' Khan said.
'They are innocent, they have rights under international humanitarian law. These rights are part of the Geneva Conventions, and they give rise to even criminal responsibility when these rights are curtailed under the Rome Statute.'
Israel, which is not a member of the ICC, has previously rejected the court's jurisdiction and does not formally engage with the court.
The ICC's founding Rome Statute gives it legal authority to investigate alleged crimes on the territory of its members or by their nationals when domestic authorities are 'unwilling or unable' to do so.
On October 10, the office of theprosecutor of the ICC said its mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict.

Biden says Hamas attack on Israel aimed at disrupting Israel-Saudi thaw

October 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
United States President Joe Biden has said he believes Hamas carried out its unprecedented attacks on Israel to derail a diplomatic thaw between the country and Saudi Arabia.
Speaking at a campaign fundraiser in Washington on Friday, Biden said Hamas carried out the October 7 attacks in part to disrupt his efforts to normalise Israel-Saudi relations.
"Guess what? The Saudis wanted to recognise Israel … unite the Middle East," Biden said, telling donors the Palestinian group knew he was 'about to sit down with the Saudis".
Biden last week told CBS's 60 Minutes that the prospect of normalisation was "still alive' but would take time, after Saudi officials reportedly paused talks with Israel in the aftermath of Hamas's October 7 attacks and the subsequent Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
Riyadh has expressed concern about the fate of Palestinians in Gaza, which has been pummelled by Israeli air strikes that Palestinian officials say have killed at least 4,137 people.
Saudi Arabia backed the US-brokered Abraham Accords that saw the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain normalise ties with Israel in 2020, but has so far not recognised Israel itself.
The Biden administration has pushed for the normalisation of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, Washington's two most powerful allies in the Middle East, and there had been signs of warming ties between the sides in recent months.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Fox News in September that Riyadh was getting closer to normalising ties 'every day" but that resolving the Palestinian issue would be crucial to reaching a deal.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Biden that a deal was "within reach" during talks on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month.
Israel and Saudi Arabia were also among about two dozen countries that agreed to work together on a rail and shipping corridor announced by Biden at the G20 summit in India

As Israel-Hamas war flares, chaos grips Britain with Braverman sacked

November 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Glasgow, United Kingdom - Suella Braverman   from her role as the United Kingdom's home secretary after she called pro-Palestinian protesters "hate marchers", adding to a sense of chaos in Britain as war flares anew in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak dismissed the populist politician on Monday, after days of speculation over her future.
The hard-right Conservative has never hidden her disdain for Britain's supporters of the besieged people of Gaza. Her sacking is understood to be linked to her   last week, in which she accused the police of being tougher on far-right activists than pro-Palestinian demonstrators.
Sunak's office did not approve the final text of the article, which The Times itself has described as "inflammatory".
In previous weeks, she had also told police that waving a Palestinian flag could become a crime – which also saw her accused of meddling.
"Historically, governments in the UK, like others across the world, have used moments of crisis to launch attacks on all of our civil liberties – often starting with those who are already marginalised," the British civil rights group Liberty said at the time.
"We saw this in response to 9/11 and the 7/7 bombings, with the creation of new and broad offences around 'glorifying' terrorism and the extension of the period for which terror suspects could be held without charge."
Braverman's dismissal – and the surprise return of ex-Prime Minister David Cameron to politics – are being mocked by observers as signs of a government in crisis.
Cameron, premier between 2010 and 2016, now holds the role of foreign secretary after James Cleverly replaced Braverman.
While the government is in a state of flux as Sunak's cabinet reshuffle gathers pace on Monday,   are rising, and rights groups are raising the alarm about a possible crackdown on  .
This past weekend, hundreds of thousands of protesters marched in London in solidarity with Gaza, marshalled by a heavy police presence, as a small number of far-right groups staged counter-protests.
The rally came about a month after Israel began shelling the Gaza Strip, in response to Hamas's unprecedented incursion into Israel. More than 1,200 Israelis and 11,000 Palestinians have been killed.
Britons sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinians have accused UK political leaders and academic institutions of pursuing a campaign to restrict – or even silence – shows of support for the beleaguered enclave.
On Saturday, some 300,000 supporters of Gaza took to the streets of London in defiance of Britain's Conservative Party-led government, which has pledged unwavering support for Israel's actions and views with scepticism pro-Palestinian support.
The rally took place on Armistice Day - the annual commemoration marking the end of World War I - which Braverman condemned as an 'unacceptable' act of desecration. Sunak cast the demonstration as "disrespectful".
Protesters including the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Stop the War Coalition and Muslim Association of Britain set off from London's Hyde Park, before ending at the US Embassy.
Exclusion zones were imposed around the city's war memorial, the Cenotaph.
Chants advocating for Gaza included 'free Palestine", "ceasefire now" and "  , Palestine will be free".
More than 100 people were arrested on the day, mostly counterprotesters.
Opposition accused of silencing debate
Accusations that Britain's political establishment is trying to crack down on freedom of speech on Gaza also extend to the  , led by Keir Starmer.
Like Sunak, he has supported Israel's bloody onslaught as its "right" to self-defence.
Last month, one of Labour's largest constituency branches in Scotland saw office bearers resign their posts en masse after accusing the party, odds-on to win the next UK general election, of silencing debate on the crisis.
Nine officials at the Glasgow Kelvin Constituency Labour Party (CLP), in Scotland's central belt, stood down in protest after a directive was issued by the party's UK and Scottish general secretaries saying, 'any motions' about Gaza would be 'out of order and should not be debated at party meetings'.
Labour Party House of Lords peer, Baroness Pauline Bryan of Partick, was among those to quit.
She lamented the 'reluctance [by Labour officials] to allow [CLPs] to express their support for the people in Gaza' and expressed concern about how the party would deal with other such debates - on Palestine or anything else - in the future.
The left-wing peer also disagreed with Starmer's decision to suspend Labour MP Andy McDonald after he referenced 'from the river to the sea' during a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally last month.
'Andy McDonald is an extremely well-respected MP,' she told Al Jazeera. 'I think people will be shocked and horrified if he's not reinstated very, very quickly.'
British academia has also become embroiled in the conflict, with universities and university bodies accused of bowing to government pressure.
On October 31, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), a national funding agency investing in science and research, suspendedits Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) advisory groupfollowing aletter of complaint by Michelle Donelan, the science secretary, who accused some members of 'sharing some extremist views on social media'.
Among her allegations was 'the amplification' of a tweet on X by one group member, which, she wrote, 'condemns violence on both sides but makes reference to Israel's 'genocide and apartheid''.
Yesterday, UKRI responded to a letter from Secretary of State, Michelle Donelan. Now we are publishing that response and the Terms of Reference for the review we are setting up. pic.twitter.com/RjZypgnbVK
- UK Research and Innovation (@UKRI_News) October 31, 2023
One academic from a leading British university said that Donelan's intervention had 'crossed a line', adding 'that the idea that tweets I make about the conflict might be held against me in this way is outrageous'.
The professor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera: 'Given the Conservative party's drift to the 'Orbanite' right, I fear this will not end here. If we do not push back against this pressure, it will invite further interventions to marginalise political positions they are hostile to and establish a precedent of academic freedom being subject to the government's own idea of which political views are acceptable.'
In response to the suspension of the EDI, many academics resigned from UKRI peer review bodies in protest.
Among them was Matt Bennett, a senior research officer at England's University of Essex.
He claimed that Donelan's letter was 'a frightening reminder that the UK government has no respect for freedom of speech in universities'.
He added: 'The secretary of state has signalled to the whole scientific community that any of us who criticise the UK government and call for a ceasefire in Gaza are in danger of being publicly labelled, by a government minister, as an extremist and supporter of terrorism.'
But Bennett told Al Jazeera that 'the UK government's assault on freedom of speech did not begin with the secretary of state's October 28 letter to UKRI'.
He flagged up the intervention made by UK Education Secretary Gillian Keegan on October 11 when she wrote to university vice-chancellors to 'remind' them of their responsibilities under the British anti-terrorism Prevent programme, insinuating that any shows of support for Gaza were anti-Semitic.
Bennett continued: 'I have been told by students and colleagues at universities about a range of repressive techniques that university managers, under pressure from government, are using to prevent students and staff holding events in solidarity with the people of Gaza.'
The academic stated that he had 'heard of students [being] prevented from distributing leaflets advertising Gaza-solidarity events by campus security' at one university. He also claimed to 'have seen an all-staff email at [another] university, sent by their most senior administrator, that smeared a student rally in solidarity with Palestine as likely to be supportive of Hamas terrorism, with no reason given for thinking this other than that the rally was pro-Palestinian'.
Indeed, reports emerged last month that SOAS University of London had suspended some of its students who had taken part in a pro-Gaza rally on campus. The SOAS Palestine Society labelled the suspensions 'a targeted act of political repression for those who stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people'.
But a SOAS spokesperson told Al Jazeera that 'the small number of suspensions relate' to students 'violating our health and safety protocol'.
'Fire alarms were set off and part of the estate was vandalised, halting lectures for the day,' the spokesperson added.

Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian teenager during one of their daily pre-dawn raids into the occupied West Bank, according to local media and the Palestinian health ministry.
Mahmoud Abu Sa'an, 18, who was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers at point-blank range as they stormed the Nur Shams refugee camp in Tulkarem early Friday, the health ministry said.
The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that local witnesses said an Israeli soldier got out of one of the military vehicles and shot Abu Sa'an in the head while he was lying on the ground.
Abu Sa'an, who had graduated from high school weeks earlier, was taken to Thabet Thabet Hospital in Tulkarem where he was pronounced dead.

Translation: The young man Mahmoud Abu Sa'an, who was martyred by occupation gunfire in the Tulkarm refugee camp at dawn today. He was among those who passed high school [exams] this year.
Fierce confrontations broke out during the raid between Palestinian residents and Israeli forces, which had snipers stationed on the rooftops of several Palestinian homes in the camp.
The raid sparked fighting with residents of the camp, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad armed group reported, with Israeli forces shooting tear gas, stun grenades and live fire and Palestinians hurling stones and opening fire at the soldiers.
Local media reports said that armed Palestinians targeted the Israeli army with homemade explosive devices, and thatthree wanted residents were arrested during Friday's raid into the town.
The overnight Tulkarem raid was part of an Israeli military arrest operation. The army said it arrested five Palestinians in other occupied West Bank villages, confiscating explosives and dispersing protests in the village Biddu near the city of Ramallah.
The armed Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in Tulkarem described Abu Sa'an's killing as an execution.
"This unarmed young man did not possess weapons and had nothing to do with any military action," the group said in a statement. "He is unarmed and was executed in a brutal manner."
The Israeli military said soldiers shot at suspects who fired and hurled explosives and stones at troops operating around the northern West Bank city of Tulkarm. It said one person was hit but reported no injuries to its forces.
Fighting between Israel and the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank intensified early last year when Israel launched near-nightly raids into Palestinian areas.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed this year in the occupied Palestinian territories and the Gaza Strip, with the majority of these fatalities recorded in the occupied West Bank.
Those figures indicate that 2023 is already the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since the United Nations began keeping track of fatalities in 2005.
At least 26 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis during that time.

Gaza authorities say hundreds killed in Israeli air raid on hospital

Hundreds of people have been killed in an Israeli air raid on a hospital in the besieged Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian authorities.
The health ministry in Gaza said on Tuesday that at least 500 people were killed in the air raid on Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in central Gaza.
The Hamas group, which governs the Palestinian territory, said the attack was a "war crime".
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said there were no details on the hospital deaths.
"We will get the details and update the public. I don't know to say whether it was an Israeli air strike," he said.
Images shared on social media appeared to show fire engulfing the building, widespread damage and bodies scattered in the wreckage.
Since Israel began pounding Gaza from the air on October 7, tens of thousands of people seeking refuge from the   have fled to hospitals throughout Gaza.
The World Health Organization condemned the attack and demanded the immediate protection of civilians and health care in the Palestinian enclave.
"WHO strongly condemns the attack on Al Ahli Arab Hospital", the UN health agency's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on the social media platform X.
Egypt said it denounced the attack "in the strongest terms". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, "It's not acceptable to hit a hospital".
Reporting from Gaza, Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum said the area where the air raid hit was "full of displaced people".
'This area [where the bombing occurred] is densely populated, full of commercial shops, residential buildings, and even was full of displaced people who have evacuated their houses after receiving orders from the IOF to evacuate,' said Azzoum.
'Those people have been evacuated from the northern area, they just only moved to the central area of the Gaza Strip, to this hospital, because they believed that this hospital was quite safe to be away from the Israeli bombardment.'
Medical and rescue workers have previously raised alarm over what they say is a pattern of   of medical vehicles by Israeli attacks.
'When ambulances are trying to reach areas under fire, they are targeted as a message that no one should get inside to evacuate injured or stuck people,' Sohaib Safi, medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) in Gaza, told Al Jazeera earlier last week.
The attack on the hospital comes amid a continuing barrage of   that have killed more than 3,000 people and reduced entire neighbourhoods in Gaza to rubble, according to Palestinian officials.
Israel launched the assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters carried out a surprise attack from the territory on southern Israel. At least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attack, according to Israeli officials and at least 199 others were taken as hostages.
The devastating attack on the hospital comes on the eve of a trip to Israel by US President Joe Biden. The visit is expected to see him reaffirm US backing for Israel and try to stop the Israel-Hamas war from spiralling into wider conflict.

Calls to sack Braverman grow amid furore over pro-Palestine rallies remarks

November 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The political future of British Home Secretary   hangs in the balance as she faces anger within her own Conservative Party after making unauthorised comments about the country's pro-Palestine demonstrations, which she called "hate marches' and for criticising the police.
In an opinion piece published in The Times on Thursday, Braverman said that the police "play favourites' and have taken a soft stance towards rallies in support of Gaza, which she described as 'pro-Palestinian mobs'.
"The content was not agreed with Number 10," a spokesperson for Prime Minister   told reporters, referring to the prime minister's Downing Street office. The ministerial code is clear that any ministerial media interventions need approval from No 10.
Sunak is under pressure to sack Braverman, but his spokesperson Max Blain also said the prime minister still had full confidence in her.
Sunak's deputy held meetings this week to discuss plans for changes to his cabinet, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, adding that a reshuffle could come as soon as next week.
Braverman is seen as a potential future leader of the governing Conservative Party, and has consistently staked out far-right positions on issues such as multiculturalism and immigration.
The opposition   has drawn on such incidents to paint a picture of a weak and divided government, with Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, calling Braverman 'out of control' and Labour leader Keir Starmer saying that Sunak is too weak to challenge her.
Sunak "must know that this isn't the way that a home secretary should behave," said Starmer. "He must know in himself that the role of responsible government is to reduce tension and to support police in the difficult decisions they have to make."
In an open letter to Sunak, Labour's national campaign coordinator Pat McFadden noted that "no previous Home Secretary has ever launched such an attack on the police".
The Prime Minister's spokesperson has confirmed that the Home Secretary's article was not cleared by No 10.
Article 8.2 of the Ministerial code says all such interventions have to be cleared.
Given it wasn't cleared, what will he do now? My letter to the PM is below. pic.twitter.com/qNff6lOfZG
- Pat McFadden (@patmcfaddenmp) November 9, 2023
There was no further update from Sunak's office about what action it would take, if any, against Braverman, according to British media reports.
Braverman's stance towards pro-Palestinian political activity has previously drawn criticism, including comments suggesting that waving a Palestinian flag could be a criminal offence.
"I do not believe that these marches are merely a cry for help for Gaza," Braverman wrote in The Times. "They are an assertion of primacy by certain groups – particularly Islamists – of the kind we are more used to seeing in Northern Ireland.'
Conservative members have said that her comments are divisive and undermine the police.
Critics have said Braverman is trying to position herself for a party leadership contest that could come if the Conservatives lose power in an election that is expected next year. Opinion polls have for months put the party 15 to 20 points behind Labour.
London has witnessed  over the past month, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets to denounce Israel's relentless bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip and demand the United Kingdom government call for a ceasefire.
A large rally in support of Palestine is expected to take place on Saturday, coinciding with Armistice weekend, an annual remembrance of World War I.
Police Commissioner Mark Rowley has said there were insufficient grounds to ban a pro-Palestine march on Armistice Day.
"At a time when we should be seeking to unite communities – the Home Secretary is dividing them. Language matters – and the Home Sec's comments are inaccurate, inflammatory and irresponsible," London Mayor Said Khan posted on X.
Since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out on October 7 – following an attack on Israel by the Palestinian group that Israeli authorities say killed more than 1,400 people – Jewish, Muslim, and Arab communities around the world have expressed fear that tensions could   into their own communities.
At least 10,812 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza since.
It is not the first time the right-wing minister has been the subject of controversy. Braverman recently called homelessness a 'lifestyle choice' and previously   from Pakistan's foreign minister after saying that Pakistani men 'hold cultural values at odds with British values' and worked in abuse rings that target 'vulnerable white English girls'.
She was in Rwanda this year to discuss an agreement in which the UK will relocate undocumented refugees and migrants there as she doubles down on a plan that has been mired in legal challenges and controversy, and was faced scathing criticism for describing the arrival of asylum seekers on the UK's southern coast as an 'invasion'.

October 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
On Sunday, Israel launched an air strike on the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in Gaza City, killing Palestinian journalist Roshdi Sarraj.
According to local news agency WAFA, the bombing of Tel al-Hawa is among many raids carried out by the Israeli occupation on various areas of the Gaza Strip, killing at least 32 Palestinians.
Roshdi's apartment was damaged in the first week of the war, and along with his wife Shorouq and one-year-old daughter Dania, he moved to the family home in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood.
'The Israelis were bombing our area with no let-up,' said Yahya al-Sarraj, Roshdi's father and municipal mayor of Gaza City. 'Roshdi tried to shield his wife and daughter when the Israeli air strike struck.'
The family home was severely damaged, but the 10 family members residing there survived, except Roshdi, who was hit by shrapnel from the Israeli strike.
He was transported to the hospital and declared a "martyr" there before his burial.
Ali Jadallah, a Palestinian photojournalist working for Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency, posted  on Instagram the purported body bag of Sarraj, with his name on it, announcing his death.
A determined journalist
Al-Sarraj praised his son's courage and bravery.
Roshdi considered it his life's work to convey the reality of what is happening in Gaza, which he loved fiercely despite the Israeli occupation's suffocating policies on the territory.
'He was supposed to go to Qatar for a work trip after he performed umrah in Mecca,' al-Sarraj said. 'But when the Israeli aggression began he immediately cancelled and came back to Gaza.'
Roshdi refused to leave Gaza City and go to the south, his father added, adamant in "staying put, saying he will not be displaced, and writing  on his social media accounts that the only way he would leave Gaza would be to go to heaven'.
'He cared about the truth,' al-Sarraj continued. 'Since the war began, he was involved in digging people out from under the rubble with his bare hands, including two physically handicapped girls.'
Roshdi started his career as a journalist around 2012, his friend and fellow journalist Hosam Salem told Al Jazeera. Originally a photo-reporter, he co-founded Ain Media , a private media company in Palestine, that year with Yaser Murtaja.
Murtaja was   by an Israeli sniper five years ago while covering the 2018   protests in the Gaza Strip, wearing his full press gear.
Roshdi formerly worked as a photographer for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), was a fixer in Gaza for several international news agencies, including Radio France, and produced a short film with Amnesty International.
Bittersweet tributes
Roshdi's death troubled both the local and international community, prompting a stream of grieving tributes on social media that praised him as a friend and as a professional.
Ain Media released a statement, calling him a 'brilliant photojournalist and film-maker'.
'Gaza is life,' Ain Media said in a post on X. 'Roshdi and Yaser are life: they gave voice to the people of Gaza, to their smiles, to the stories locked in fear, to hopes cherished secretly from the oppression of the Israeli occupation.'

Well-known international photojournalist Wissam Nassar, mourned his friend on Instagram : 'My close friend, Rushdi Sarraj, was killed in Israeli bombardment on his home. He was a talented photojournalist and director creatively telling the stories of Gazans under war and siege. May you rest in peace.'
Salem also paid tribute to his friend and colleague in a heartwarming carousel of images on Instagram, writing: "My best One was just killed in an Israeli airstrike in #Gaza. May God have mercy on you and accept you. You and Yaser are lucky."
Radio France Internationale (RFI), the state-owned international radio news network of France, published a statement  paying tribute to Roshdi's "important role" with the network, with several of the channel's correspondents also commending his friendship and legacy.
"Those who knew Roshdi Sarraj and worked with him salute an outstanding journalist," the statement read.
Le photojournaliste Roshdi Sarraj tait mon fixeur  Gaza. Il est mort il y a quelques heures aprs un bombardement isralien. A 31 ans, il tait un pre et un poux heureux, un professionnel irrprochable devenu un ami. C'est un innocent qui a perdu la vie. https://t.co/XUM98dlnIA

Translation: Photojournalist Roshdi Sarraj was my fixer in Gaza. He died a few hours ago following an Israeli bombing. At 31, he was a happy father and husband, an impeccable professional who became a friend. An innocent man who lost his life.
 
Amnesty International's Secretary General Agnes Callamard also paid tribute to Roshdi and his work for Amnesty in a post  on X, saying he "was murdered today in an Israeli air strike."
Journalism is not a crime
Since Hamas launched its   on Israel more than two weeks ago, more than 20 journalists have been killed.
Israel has been relentlessly   the Gaza Strip, striking the world's "largest open-air prison" with accelerated intensity daily since the beginning of the war.
(Al Jazeera)  (Al Jazeera)
Palestinians in the  , which forms the bulk of Palestinian territories, have not been spared either with an increase in uncontrolled settler violence and escalating military raids.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement  saying that the "conflict has taken a severe toll on journalists," especially those in Gaza facing "particularly high risks" amidst incessant and indiscriminate shelling by Israeli troops and the occupying government's total   on the already  .
Several Palestinian journalists have openly shared on social media that they are incapable of reporting because of network and electricity cuts, constant sudden evacuations and complete burnout.
CPJ reported that as of October 22, 23 journalists have been killed including 19 Palestinians, three Israelis, and one Lebanese. Around eight have been injured and three are reported missing or detained.
On  , the first day of the war, Ibrahim Mohammad Lafi, a photographer  for Roshdi's Ain Media, was shot and killed by the occupation at the Gaza Strip crossing into Israel known as Beit Hanoon to Palestinians and as Erez to Israelis. He was one among three Palestinian journalists   there that day.
Two Palestinian photographers were also reported missing on October 7: Nidal Al-Wahidi, who worked for Al-Najah channel, and Haitham Abdelwahid, who also worked for Roshdi's Ain Media.
Al-Wahidi's family informed themediathat the journalist had been detained by the Israeli army.
"He was responsible for several employees [at Ain Media]. Our colleague Ibrahim was martyred, Nidal and Haitham went missing. Roshdi could not tolerate the news, so he cancelled his trip and flew back to Gaza," said Salem.
According to Salem, Roshdi's mental state deteriorated at the news, especially after experiencing Murtaja's murder, but he was back in the field two days later.
"I feel like I betrayed Roshdi," Salem told Al Jazeera, sounding despondent over the telephone.
"Roshdi is now a martyr; he was buried and I did not get the chance to say my goodbyes or be present at his funeral," he sighed heavily. "None of this matters. What matters is the fact that he died … and I am still alive."
"Journalists are still persevering … We are all like that, all the journalists in Gaza are working under immense pressure."
Salem said Roshdi's legacy will live on, even though he never had the chance to continue the journey he dreamed of.
'He was loved by everyone, and very ambitious. Now he's with his friend Yaser Murtaja,' said Roshdi's father, in a final farewell.

What we know so far about the deadly strike on a Gaza hospital

At least   have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in the besieged Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said.
The health ministry in Gaza said the blast at the hospital was caused by an Israeli air raid. Israel has attributed the explosion to a misfired rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) armed group. The PIJ has denied the allegation.
Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the accounts.
As tensions continue to rise, here is what we know so far about the strike:
Hundreds killed
The health ministry in Gaza says at least 500 people   in the blast, by far the highest death toll of any single incident in Gaza during the current war between Israel and Hamas.
The ministry said hundreds of other victims remained under the rubble.
Hamas said the blast mostly killed displaced people.
The Palestinian Authority's health minister, Mai Alkaila, accused Israel of carrying out "a massacre".
Located in central Gaza, the hospital, which is run by the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, was struck while it was overwhelmed with thousands of Palestinians seeking shelter amid a campaign of brutal Israeli air attacks across much of the besieged Gaza Strip.
How has the world reacted?
World leaders have  , with leaders from across the Middle East issuing the firmest statements.
Protests have also erupted across the Middle East, including in Jordan and in the Israeli-occupied   where Palestinian protests have confronted the Palestinian Authority's security forces.
Jordan has cancelled a planned summit in the capital of Amman with United States President Joe Biden and Arab leaders.
Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the meeting would be held at a time when all present could agree to work towards ending the "war and the massacres against Palestinians".
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who had also been slated to attend the summit, said he condemned 'in the strongest possible terms Israel's bombardment' of the Gaza hospital.
Saudi Arabia also issued a firm statement, condemning "in the strongest possible terms the heinous crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces by bombing Al Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza".
Western leaders did not blame Israel for the strike, with French President   saying in a social media post that 'nothing can justify a strike against a hospital' and adding that "all the light must be shed on the circumstances".
Nothing can justify striking a hospital.
Nothing can justify targeting civilians.
France condemns the attack on the Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, which made so many Palestinian victims. Our thoughts are with them. All the light must be shed on the circumstances.
- Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) October 17, 2023
Biden in a statement offered 'deepest condolences for the innocent lives lost in the hospital explosion in Gaza'.
What does Israel say?
Israeli authorities said the hospital was hit by an errant rocket fired by  , which operates inside the Gaza Strip.
'An analysis of IDF [Israel's army] operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a social media post.
'Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza.'
Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters rockets fired by the PIJ passed by the hospital at the time of the strike, which he said hit the facility's parking lot.
Hagari claimed there was no direct hit on the facility and said military drone footage showed "a kind of hit in the parking lot".
He said the military did have an Israeli Air Force operation in the area around the time of the hospital blast "but it was with a different kind of ammunition that does not … fit the footage that we have [of] the hospital."
What does PIJ say?
The PIJ has rejected the Israeli allegation that it was responsible for the strike.
"The Zionist enemy is trying hard to evade its responsibility for the brutal massacre he committed by bombing the Baptist Arab National Hospital in Gaza through his usual fabrication of lies, and through pointing the finger of blame at the Islamic Jihad movement in Palestine," it said in a statement.
"We therefore affirm that the accusations put forward by the enemy are false and baseless," it added.
Al Jazeera's Imran Khan noted that some observers have questioned Israel's version of events, with some pointing to Israel's history of falsely attributing acts carried out by its own forces to armed Palestinian groups.
'We've seen this type of thing before from the Israelis,' Khan said on Tuesday.
'Take for example the killing of our colleague Shireen Abu Akleh. At the initial stages of that report, the Israelis blamed fighters within Jenin camp for her death. It was only later that they admitted it was one of theirs.'

Israel continues heavy shelling in the vicinity of several hospitals in the north of the Gaza Strip, officials in the besieged enclave say as all communications and internet services were once again cut.
'For more than an hour, intense bombings have been taking place around hospitals,' Salama Maarouf, head of the Hamas government's media office, said on Sunday evening.
The vicinity of the Palestinian territory's largest hospital, Al Shifa, saw particularly heavy strikes, according to Marouf.
Al Jazeera's Safwat Kahlout, reporting from Deir Al Balah in central Gaza, also said the most intense shelling on Sunday was taking place in the area surrounding the hospital.
'We can understand that these air strikes are aimed at pushing the Israeli troops surrounding Gaza City towards the Al Shifa Hospital. We know that thousands of people left their homes in these neighbourhoods towards the hospital, seeking shelter,' he said.
'Which indicates that the Israeli army is planning for something big, maybe in the coming hours or in the coming days in terms of the Al Shifa Hospital itself.'
Around 2.3 million Gaza civilians ‍‍‍are presently unable to access emergency medical services amidst ongoing bombings, experiencing their third communications blackout since the escalation began. #Gaza_under_attack
- PRCS (@PalestineRCS) November 5, 2023
Earlier on Sunday, an Israeli attack hit near Al Quds Hospital in Gaza City, wounding at least 14 people and damaging the building.
The bombing came after the Israeli military once again accused Hamas of using hospitals in their military campaign against Israel.
"Hamas places forces and weapons inside, under and around schools, mosques, homes and UN facilities," Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters on Sunday.
"Among the worst of Hamas war crimes is the use of hospitals to hide their terror infrastructure."
Hamas has repeatedly rejected the charge.
The Israeli army confirmed that 'significant' strikes were under way in Gaza on Sunday, with a military spokesman claiming Israel's ground assault had split the Palestinian territory in two.
Israeli forces 'have encircled Gaza City Now there exists a south Gaza and a north Gaza,' said spokesman Daniel Hagari. Troops 'reached the coastline and are holding it,' he added.
Internet access advocacy group NetBlocks.org reported a "collapse in connectivity" across Gaza. The blackout was confirmed by the Palestinian telecom company Paltel.
"We have lost communication with the vast majority of the UNRWA team members," UN Palestinian refugee agency spokesperson Juliette Touma told The Associated Press. The first Gaza outage lasted 36 hours and the second one for a few hours.
Concerns over health facilities sheltering civilians
The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern for the safety of patients, health workers and the thousands of people sheltering in Al Quds Hospital.
'WHO reiterates its call for an immediate ceasefire, active protection of civilians and healthcare, and respect for International Humanitarian Law,' the agency said in a post on X.
'In our Al Quds Hospital, we are deeply concerned about the situation because of the heavy shelling in the last days, really hitting in the proximity of the hospital,' Tommaso della Longa, a Geneva-based spokesperson for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, told Al Jazeera.
'Yesterday [Saturday], literally the building in front of the hospital was hit,' he said, adding that the attack broke windows and smoke entered the hospital, which is currently treating about 500 patients.
Hospitals and ambulances have been hit several times since the latest Israeli attacks began on October 7, killing patients, displaced civilians sheltering at the facilities as well as health workers.
According to the WHO, 39 health facilities have been damaged since the war began. Hospitals have also been forced to   or cut services after electricity and fuel supply was cut.
At least 9,770 Palestinians, including 4,008 children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the latest war began, while entire neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble. More than 1,400 people were killed in an attack by Hamas on southern Israel, which started this war.
Nearly 1.5 million people are now internally displaced in Gaza, according to the United Nations.

Inside Benjamin Netanyahu's mind: How is Israel's PM plotting the war?

November 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Beirut, Lebanon – Gal Hirsch has no known experience in hostage negotiations, and in 2006, he left the Israeli forces, disgraced over his role in military failures during the war with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Yet when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu picked the former military commander to lead efforts for the release of captives taken by Hamas to Gaza after its October 7 attack, that decision made sense to political psychologist Saul Kimhi.
"He's choosing people [to join his wartime administration] based on their opinions of him and not on how fit they are for the job," Kimhi said. Hirsch is a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, and — like Israel's prime minister himself — has faced charges of corruption.
Kimhi, who teaches at Tel Aviv University, has studied Netanyahu's mind for almost a quarter of a century. In 1999, the same year that Netanyahu's first term as premier would end, Kimhi's behavioural analysis of the leader found a concerning pattern of behaviour. Some of his conclusions: Netanyahu was narcissistic, entitled and paranoid, and he reacted poorly under stress.
Kimhi revisited Netanyahu as a subject in 2017 but found not much had changed. As people age, Kimhi said, their behaviours tend to become more extreme. For Netanyahu, his paranoia and narcissism have grown. He trusts no one, except maybe his immediate family, and prioritises his "personal future" over all else, Kimhi's research found.
Now, as he leads his nation into the war on Gaza, the personality traits that shape Netanyahu's biggest decisions could directly affect the lives of millions of Israelis and Palestinians and the direction of the conflict. And the signs so far, according to Kimhi and other analysts, are worrying.
Indecisive and distrustful
Netanyahu's behavioural analysis, according to Kimhi, suggests that he is indecisive and struggles with difficult decisions. "He is not a resilient person at all," Kimhi told Al Jazeera.
Before Netanyahu appointed Hirsch on October 8, the position of hostage negotiator had been left vacant for more than a year. Hamas took more than 200 Israelis captive during its raid on southern Israel, and only a handful have been released so far. This, Kimhi said, was an example of Netanyahu taking "tough decisions at the very last minute".
To be sure, Netanyahu also has qualities that appear to have helped him emerge as one of the world's great political survivors. A 2021 personality study  by the Jordanian professor of political science Walid 'Abd al-Hay, found Netanyahu to be highly charismatic, "with a strong memory and high analytical ability".
In a career at the top of Israeli politics spanning almost three decades, those attributes have frequently worked for him.
Netanyahu is Israel's longest-serving prime minister. He first came to power in 1996 and served a three-year term before he was replaced by Ehud Barak. He would return to power in 2009 and then serve for 13 of the last 14 years.
On a handful of occasions, Netanyahu's time appeared to be running out. In 2015, with his back to the wall, he used a scaremongering tactic, saying "Arab voters are heading to the polling stations in droves." He was re-elected.
After losing the premiership for a year, he came back to power in 2022, this time, by assembling the most far-right government in Israel's history.
National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has been convicted of incitement to racism, destroying property, and joining a "terror" organisation when he was 16 years old. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich leads the hardline Religious Zionist Party that not only rejects Palestinian statehood but denies the existence of the Palestinian people and has condemned LGBTQ activists. Interior and Health Minister Aryeh Deri is an ultraorthodox rabbi who was sentenced to three years in jail for taking bribes.
By composing such a cabinet, critics have accused Netanyahu of choosing his own political survival over Israel's interests. An op-ed in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz has described some of Netanyahu's ministers as "neo-Nazi" and "neo-fascist".
However, none of that will matter much to Netanyahu. The important thing for him, according to Kimhi and other analysts who have studied the Israeli prime minister, is that he is in power, no matter the cost.
The extremist views in his cabinet may not bother him because "everything goes through him without the ministers knowing", Thomas Vesconi, an independent researcher and author of two books on Palestine and Israel, told Al Jazeera.
Killing the 'two-state solution'
Netanyahu's paranoia and entitlement have arguably shaped his view on a Palestinian state as well. Despite publicly saying he is open to a two-state solution, he has undermined the process at every turn —including by insisting that a Palestinian state should have no military or security oversight over its territory.
Under his reign, settlement expansion has flourished and political repression of Palestinians is rampant. Even before October 7, this year was the deadliest on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank with more than 150 people killed by Israeli forces, 38 of those children. More than 100 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October 7. Netanyahu has tried to circumvent a Palestinian state by building regional agreements with Arab states through the Abraham Accords.
The issue of settlements and Netanyahu's perceived unwillingness to engage in good-faith peace talks has grated many of Netanyahu's foreign contemporaries over the years. "I cannot bear Netanyahu," former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling then-American President Barack Obama on a hot mic in 2011. "He's a liar."
"You're fed up with him, but I have to deal with him even more often than you," Obama had replied.
According to Vesconi, Netanyahu believes that all of historical Palestine should belong to Israel. It is a belief with roots in Netanyahu's upbringing.
Father's son
Benzion Netanyahu, the prime minister's father, was a proponent of Ze'ev Jabotinsky – a proponent of what is known as Revisionist Zionism – who believed a Jewish state should extend to both sides of the Jordan River. In effect, that means an Israel that includes the country's current territory, the West Bank, Gaza and part or all of Jordan.
After failing to be awarded a position at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Benzion moved his family to the United States and took a position at Cornell University where he taught Judaic Studies. He carried that rejection for the rest of his life, and along with it, a distrust of intellectuals and the Israeli Labor Party.
Netanyahu held his father, who died in 2012 at the age of 102, in high regard. He said his father knew "how to identify danger in time" and "draw the necessary conclusions".
Netanyahu learned that relationships were transactional – not altruistic – and "that humans live in constant Darwinian struggle for survival", according to 'Abd al-Hay's study.
The Israeli prime minister is currently waging his own struggle to survive in office. He once enjoyed support from deeply religious conservatives and young, liberal capitalists working in sectors like tech — what Vesconi calls the two bourgeois.
But in recent times, he has lost the liberals while the religious right has intensified their support to that of what Kimhi calls "almost like a cult". Starting in January 2023, Israelis flooded the streets to protest against wide-ranging judicial reform. Netanyahu said the changes are to balance an interventionist court.
Meanwhile, he is currently under trial for corruption, fraud and breach of trust and public opinion largely blames him for allowing the October 7 attack which saw Hamas break through a border fence, killing about 1,400 people and taking some 200 people captive.
What's next
Under fire once again, Netanyahu's character flaws are once again showing themselves, Kimhi said.
Analysts believe Netanyahu is likely to want to prolong the war, as few in Israel will call for a change of leader amid a war. More than 8,500 Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks in an assault of unprecedented intensity on Gaza. More than 3,000 of those are children. But those figures, much like the hostages, do not seem to be of concern to Netanyahu.
Putting his survival first aligns with the conclusions of Kimhi and 'Abd al-Hay's studies. Whatever move he takes next will be with that in mind.
"The Israeli public," Kimhi said, "needs a real leader that can unite people."

October 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Following Hamas's unprecedented   on Israel more than a week ago, much of the international community rushed to   about the escalation in tensions.
However, as Israel continues to   and attack Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, several governments have started to turn critical of Israel's actions — some more directly than others.
Here is a list of countries that have called on Israel to stop its aggression and move towards a ceasefire.
Algeria
The Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed deep concern over Israel's attacks on Gaza, accusing it of violating international humanitarian law.
Algeria has also called for immediate international intervention to protect the Palestinian people, whose rights it has described as central to the resolution of the conflict.
African Union
The Chairperson of the African Union Moussa Faki Mahamat has highlighted the denial of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people as the main cause of the current tensions. The AU appealed to both parties to end military hostilities and return to the negotiating table.
Belize
Belize has decried the hostilities between Hamas and Israel and called for immediate de-escalation while supporting a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and demanding the right of return for Palestinians displaced from their ancestral homeland.
Brazil
Brazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Luiz Iecker Vieira said  on Friday that his country has "received with dismay the news that Israeli forces called for all civilians — more than one million — living in northern Gaza to leave within 24 hours".
Veira, who was speaking in New York after a United Nations Security Council meeting, referred to the UN's assessment that such a large-scale move of people could lead to "unprecedented levels of misery" for civilians while calling for an end to violence on both sides.
Colombia
Colombian President Gustavo Petro emphasised the need for Israel and Palestine to come to the negotiation table and work towards a two-state solution. He drew historical comparisons between the situation in Gaza and past atrocities.
In a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter, he said: "Gaza today appears as   or more so than the Warsaw ghetto after it was destroyed by Nazi barbarity in response to the Jewish and socialist insurrection in that concentration camp."
Cuba
Cuba has condemned the violence in Israel and Palestine, attributing it to the long-standing violation of Palestinian rights.
Indonesia
Indonesia has urged an immediate end to violence to prevent further casualties, also arguing that the occupation of Palestinian territories by Israel was the root cause of the conflict as the occupation.
Iraq
Iraq has likewise called the attacks on Gaza a continuation of the oppression of Palestinians under Israel's occupation.
Iran
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani has described Palestinian resistance as a natural reaction to Israel's provocations.
Ireland
Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has condemned Israel's actions of cutting off power, fuel supplies and water, calling it a   and collective punishment.
Kuwait
Kuwait's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed concern over the escalation in Gaza, calling on the international community to stop the violence, protect the Palestinian people, and end Israel's provocations. It has warned that the continuation of violence without deterrence would undermine peace efforts and the prospects of a two-state solution.
Morocco
Morocco, which is moving towards full diplomatic ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, has voiced deep concern over the situation in Gaza and called for an immediate cessation of violence and a return to calm. The country emphasised the importance of dialogue and negotiations as the way to reach a two-state solution.
In an Arab League session, Morocco's Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Bourita, emphasised Morocco's 'full and unwavering support' for Palestine.
Malaysia
Malaysia has called for an end to the violence in the  , highlighting the prolonged occupation and suffering of the Palestinian people, and the desecration of Al-Aqsa Mosque as the root cause of the conflict.
Maldives
The Maldivian government has expressed concern about the escalating violence in the Gaza Strip and reiterated its solidarity with the Palestinian people.
Its government has said that lasting peace in the Middle East can only be achieved through a two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.
Norway
Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt has criticised the   as unacceptable and emphasised that Israel's right to self-defence must adhere to international law.
"The establishment of a full blockade, including on access to electricity, water, food, and other goods that are indispensable for the survival of the civilian population in Gaza, is unacceptable,' Huitfeldt said in a statement.
'The scale of destruction in Gaza is enormous. A large number of civilians have been killed. Given a full blockade by Israel, closed border crossings, and continued Israeli attacks, I fear that the civilian population in Gaza will face even greater hardship in the days to come,' she added.
Oman
Oman's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed concern over the ongoing escalation between Palestinians and Israelis, emphasising the need for both parties to exercise restraint, and calling for international intervention to stop the escalation.
Stressing the importance of adhering to international law, Oman highlighted the strategic necessity of finding a just, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue based on the two-state solution.
Qatar
Qatar has called for all parties to de-escalate and exercise restraint amid the escalating situation in Gaza, holding Israel responsible for the escalation due to its violations of Palestinian rights, particularly incursions into Al-Aqsa Mosque.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the international community to compel Israel to respect international law and the historical rights of the Palestinian people and prevent further violence against Palestinian civilians. Qatar has reiterated its firm position in support of the Palestinian cause, including the establishment of an independent state based on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Russia
Russia stressed that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot be resolved by force but through political and diplomatic means. Russia called for an immediate ceasefire, renouncing violence, and a negotiation process with international community assistance to establish lasting peace in the Middle East.
President Vladimir Putin has emphasised the "creation of an independent Palestine state with East Jerusalem as its capital" to resolve the issue.
Moscow has also refused to list Hamas as a 'terrorist' organisation following similar steps taken by France and the European Union earlier this week.
Syria
Syria has praised the Palestinian resistance factions behind last the October 7 attack, while criticising Israel's occupation and siege.
South Africa
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday underscored  his country's historic support for the "just struggle" of Palestinians in a public statement, standing with a keffiyeh around his shoulders in front of people holding aloft small Palestinian flags.
"All of us standing here pledge our solidarity with the people of Palestine," he said.
He described Israel as an "oppressive regime" and pointed to what many human rights groups have described as Israel's apartheid-like policies towards Palestinians.
Venezuela
The Government of Venezuela voiced its anxiety concerning the situation in the Gaza Strip and called for the end of violence throughout Palestinian territory through direct dialogue and compliance with UN Security Council resolution 2334. Venezuela urged the United Nations to fulfil its role as a guarantor of international peace and legality.

'He threw up blood': Palestinian detainees face abuse in Israeli custody

November 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Ramallah, occupied West Bank – On the morning of October 8, one day after Hamas's attack, Israeli special forces units raided the cells of Gilboa prison and violently beat   held there.
"The revenge attack began that morning,' Salah Fateen Salah, a former prisoner who was released from Gilboa on October 24 after five years in prison, told Al Jazeera.
'They shouted through the speakers telling all the prisoners to get inside their rooms, kneel down on their knees, put their hands on their heads, and to face away from the door, so you have no idea what's happening behind you when they open the door," explained 23-year-old Salah.
'Then they came in and started beating people, several rooms at once, with their hands, feet and batons, including metal ones,' he said. 'They unleashed their dogs on us.
'They beat a prisoner who has diabetes and takes three injections a day. He was throwing up so much blood we were worried sick for two hours that he would be martyred from the amount of blood that he was throwing up," said Salah.
Israeli forces also 'cut open the forehead of another man who was my cellmate,' he said, noting 'there was blood all over the prison floors'.
The beatings, said Salah, went on for days. 'They have no humanity. Those who beat elderly and sick people have no humanity. The head of the prison himself was making death threats against us."
Deaths in custody
Since October 7, two Palestinian prisoners have died while in Israeli custody shortly after they were arrested, and at least dozens have been injured. Both men who died in custody were held without trial or charge.
Several videos have also emerged in recent weeks of Israeli soldiers beating, stepping on, abusing and humiliating detained Palestinians who have been blindfolded, stripped either partially or entirely, and have their hands cuffed. Many social media users said the scenes brought back memories of the torture by United States forces in Iraq's Abu Ghraib in 2003.
It's no surprise then, that the same government that tortured Iraqis in Abu Ghraib is funding the same tactics on Palestinians. This is disgusting.
CEASEFIRE NOW! END U.S. MILITARY FUNDING TO ISRAEL NOW!
- Jewish Voice for Peace (@jvplive) October 31, 2023
Recently released prisoners, as well as prisoner rights groups, lawyers' groups and official institutions, have all publicly said, and told Al Jazeera, they believe that any Palestinian in Israeli custody is currently at risk of death.
"The situation inside the prisons is horrific," said Amani Sarahneh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Prisoners Society.
"We are receiving information of daily mass beatings of the prisoners. They [Israeli authorities] are threatening to kill them," she told Al Jazeera, adding that "no one has been spared."
On October 23, Israeli authorities announced that 56-year-old Palestinian prisoner Omar Daraghmeh died in Megiddo prison "after feeling unwell and going to the prison clinic for tests".
Daraghmeh's son Nimr confirmed to Al Jazeera that his father did not have any medical conditions before his arrest only two weeks prior, on October 9, from his home in the city of Tubas in the northern occupied West Bank.
The initial medical report issued by the Israeli prison administration, Sarahneh said, noted that Daraghmeh was "suffering from internal bleeding, particularly in his stomach and intestines,' which the family believes was 'the result of beating'.
Omar Daraghmeh, a 56-year-old without underlying #medical  conditions, died in prison on October 11 - mere hours after telling his lawyer he felt well. Arafat Hamdan, a 25-year-old with diabetes, died in Ofer Prison on October 24, two days after his arrest.
- Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) (@PHRIsrael) October 26, 2023
On October 24, Arafat Hamdan, a 25-year-old with diabetes from the village of Beit Sira on the outskirts of Ramallah, was announced dead in Ofer prison two days after he was arrested.
Al Jazeera, Palestinian prisoner groups and his family received the same information on what transpired: Israeli forces beat Hamdan, refused him his medication, and placed him under the sun with a bag on his head for long hours before he died.
"This is what happened based on the testimonies from the people who were detained with him at Etzion, and what his family have heard, too," said Sarahneh, noting that Hamdan, as for the majority of people who are detained, was beaten in front of his family during his arrest.
Al Jazeera reached out to the Israeli prison services for comment on both cases but did not receive one in time for publication.
Naji Abbas, prisoners' case manager at Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), told Al Jazeera that autopsies were conducted on Tuesday for both Daraghmeh and Hamdan at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv by a doctor appointed by the Palestinian Authority (PA).
It is not clear when the institute's report will come out.
Double the detainees
Since Israel's bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip began on October 7, Israeli forces have also intensified their nightly raids into Palestinian homes, villages and cities in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
In the past 25 days, Israel has   in its custody, from 5,200 people to more than 10,000.
This includes at least 4,000 labourers from Gaza who were working in Israel and who have been detained mainly in military bases. Separately, Israel has also arrested 1,740 other Palestinians in overnight army raids  in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7.
Most of these prisoners are being held under laws and military orders that allow detention without trial or charge.
A 25-year-old former prisoner, who asked not to be named, told Al Jazeera that two of his uncles, both in their 50s, were beaten while they were arrested at their homes in the Dheisheh refugee camp in Bethlehem in the south of the occupied West Bank.
"They took my uncle Ahmad*, separated him from his family, while his wife and six children were inanother room listening to the sound of them beating him," he said.
Days after his uncles were arrested, he stumbled upon a widely shared video of three roughed up, blindfolded and handcuffed Palestinian men on the floor of an Israeli detention centre with soldiers mocking them, only to realise that one of them was his uncle.
Abbas, the case manager at PHRI, told Al Jazeera that his organisation is asking Israeli institutions including the army, the police and the intelligence, for answers to questions about rights violations arising from the videos of soldiers abusing Palestinian detainees.
Continuing crackdown
In addition to the severe beatings, Israeli prison authorities halted medical attention for Palestinian prisoners for at least the first week after October 7, including to those who had been beaten, according to rights groups. Family visits as well as routine lawyer visits were stopped, the groups said.
Where prisoners were previously entitled to between three and four hours outside their cells in the yard, that has now been cut to less than an hour. "They remain locked up in their rooms all day – even sick people, disabled, elderly," said Abbas.
Overcrowded cells now often house double the number of detainees they were built for, with many sleeping on the floor without mattresses.
Meanwhile, Israeli prison forces have also cut electricity and hot water, conducted cell searches, removed all electrical devices including TVs, radios, cooking slabs and kettles, and shut down the canteen which prisoners use to buy food and basic supplies such as toothpaste.
'All public facilities were shut down — the kitchen, the canteen, the laundry room where we wash our clothes,' said Salah, the released prisoner.
One prisoner, who remains behind bars, told his lawyer that the maltreatment of prisoners is continuing: In the facility where this prisoner is being held, Israeli prison authorities even removed the shower curtains, denying them privacy while bathing. The prisoners have since refused to shower.
*Some names have been changed to protect peoples' identities.

One month of Israel's war: What's happening to Palestinians outside Gaza?

November 7th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Ramallah, occupied West Bank - Over the past month, the world's attention has been almost exclusively focused on what is often described as the Israel-Hamas war.
  have been killed by the Israeli army in the besieged Gaza Strip since October 7 by heavy aerial and artillery bombardments – more than 4,000 children and 2,550 women.
Some 24,800 others, including 10,000 children, have been injured, and 1.5 million people – some 60 percent of the population – have been forcibly displaced from their homes hoping to escape death, with many of them killed while sheltering in hospitals, schools and refugee camps.
But aside from attacks on the Gaza Strip, Israel and Israeli settlers have simultaneously intensified attacks against Palestinians beyond the enclave.
Here's what to know about that:
Intensified killings
Under Israel's 56-year military occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Israeli forces have regularly opened fire at unarmed Palestinians during daily raids and confrontations.
Matters on the ground were already tense in those areas well before October 7. In fact, the United Nations had declared 2022 the "deadliest" year for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since 2006. Israeli forces had   170 Palestinians in those areas in 2022, including more than 30 children, while more than 9,000 others were injured.
The number of Palestinians killedin 2023 has already significantly surpassed last year's death toll.
Since January 1, Israeli forces and settlers have killed at least 371 people in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Nearly half of those – 163 people – were killed just in the past month. At least 43 of them were children.
More than 2,300 others have been wounded over the past month, including  , with more than half of them injured in protests against the bombardment of Gaza.
Settler attacks and forced displacement
Deadly attacks by Israeli citizens living in hundreds of fortified illegal   and outpostsin the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem have severely increased since October 7.
Some 700,000 settlers live in the midst of and around Palestinian neighbourhoods and cities under heavy protection. The vast majority of illegal Israeli settlements have been built either fully or partially on private Palestinian land.
Settlers, many of whom are armed, have shot and killed at least eight Palestinians in those areas over the past month. They have been raiding Palestinian villages on a daily basis, assaulting residents and their properties, and have injured at least 64 people in the same period.
Since October 7, the UN has   202 settler attacks against Palestinians, with 28 incidents resulting in Palestinian casualties, 141 incidents resulting in damage to property, and33 incidents leading to both casualties and property damage.
"This reflects a daily average of seven incidents, compared with three since the beginning of the year," the UN said . "Over one-third of these incidents included threats with firearms, including shootings". The UN noted that "in nearly half of all incidents, Israeli forces were either accompanying or actively supporting the attackers."
The increase in settler violence since October 7 has directly led to the forced displacement of at least 905 Palestinians from their homes such as in the  , and in   near Ramallah.
According to the UN , that figure comprises 111 households, and includes 356 children.
On October 13, several days after Hamas's attack, Israel's Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir began to distribute thousands of assault rifles to Israelis, with priority to settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, and to Israelis living alongside Palestinians in "mixed cities" inside Israel such as Lydda and Ramle.
The latest settler killing of a Palestinian took place on October 29, when settlers shot dead 40-year-old   while he was harvesting the olive trees on his land in the village of al-Sawiya south of Nablus city.
Earlier in October, settlers attacked the village of Qusra, also in Nablus, killing three residents. During their funeral the next day, settlers attacked the village once more, killing three more Palestinians, including a father and his son.
Arrests and conditions for prisoners
Another main major development since October 7 is the sharp increase in the number of Palestinians arrested by Israeli forces. In two weeks, Israel had   the number of Palestinians in its custody. Around 3,200 Palestinian labourers from Gaza who were arrested inside Israel early in the war were released by Israel last week.
Many of those who were already inside the prisons, or were newly detained, have been assaulted by Israeli forces, according to prisoner testimonies and rights groups. At least two prisoners lost their lives in Israeli custody shortly after they were arrested since October 7. A third, a Palestinian worker from Gaza who had cancer, was announced dead by Wafa news agency on Monday.
"The prisoners are undergoing the harshest beatings and torture in Israeli prisons at the moment," Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Prisoners Society, told Al Jazeera.
"More often than not, six or seven guards beat one prisoner all over his body, using sticks, handcuffs, their boots – whatever they have. Some of the prisoners have suffered broken bones and teeth as a result," he said.
"The arrest campaign is part of the Israeli aggression waged on the Palestinian people. These arrests are not specific to people who are suspected of being security threats. It is obvious that this is an act of revenge," said Fares.
Several videos have also emerged in recent weeks of Israeli soldiers beating, stepping on, abusing and humiliating detained Palestinians who have been blindfolded, handcuffed, and stripped of their clothing, either partially or entirely. Many social media users said the scenes brought back memories of the torture by United States forces in Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison in 2003.
Policies against Palestinians inside Israel
Palestinians in Israel, many of whom work and live alongside Israelis, are facing a crackdown over the remotest expressions of solidarity with Gaza, with residents arrested,   and suspended from universities.
"If someone posts a line from the Quran or a message praying for Gaza, they are accused of incitement and reported to police, often by their own colleagues," Fida Shehadeh, a former member of the Lydda municipality, told Al Jazeera. "People are afraid."
On October 19, the Israeli police chief,  , threatened to deport Palestinians inside Israel to Gaza for identifying with the rest of their people.
Shehadeh, who is currently part of an emergency coalition of lawyers in Lydda and Ramle, said at least 172 Palestinians inside Israel have been arrested since October 7, including Nazareth-based singer and popular icon Dalal Abu Amneh – over a Facebook post.
"They [Israel] introduced an amendment to the labour law to prevent Palestinians who have been fired from their jobs over social media posts from collecting their end-of-service funds," said Shehadeh.
The other main issue plaguing Palestinians inside Israel is the proliferation of weapons among Israeli civilians.
"We are now existing in an environment that is filled with weapons. I'm sitting in a play area with my nephew while speaking to you and there's an Israeli woman sitting with an M16 rifle," Shehadeh told Al Jazeera.
"Israeli authorities have set up rooms – through the police and the army – for Israelis to have easy access to weapons. You take your weapon and go – the state gives it to you and you have to return it by end of day," she explained.
According to Shehadeh, these rooms have "already been set up in all 'mixed cities' such as Lydda, and also in Nahariya and Netanya – places where Palestinians work."
Palestinian Authority
The government in the occupied West Bank has not had any influence in calling for the end of the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, Ramallah-based analyst Ismat Mansour said.
The   (PA) is unpopular amongst Palestinians, and widely seen as corrupt and a partner in collaboration with Israel on security matters, which includes arresting Palestinians for dissent or any resistance activities.
The PA has already indicated that it is discussing with the United States possible scenarios for a post-Hamas Gaza.
"The US is trying to create a new situation post-war thinking that Israel will be successful in eradicating Hamas from the Gaza Strip," Mansour said, referring to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's meeting with PA President Mahmoud Abbas on Sunday.
"It is banking on there being a political vacuum, and wants to get ahead of it in line with its own interests in the region."
Despite the PA on paper condemning the war in Gaza and calling for it to stop, its acquiescence to the US can only be seen as being complicit with what the US and Israel want, Mansour said.
However, the Israeli aggression, which is not against Hamas but against the entire Palestinian people, is not over yet, he argued.
"In the case that Hamas will no longer rule Gaza, that doesn't mean that Hamas as a movement will be gone. Any plans for the future of the Gaza Strip must take into account the presence of Hamas and its influence, and what role it can play," he noted, saying that Hamas as a movement cannot be crushed.
"The role of the PA is supposed to be defending the Palestinian people," Mansour said. "Unfortunately, it has only acted as a normalising partner with Israel and is content to be merely an observer, which is a shameful position."

'We only wanted to leave': One Palestinian family's attempt to flee Gaza

October 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Sabreen Abd Rabu, her husband and their three children had only recently arrived at the   on the southern border of the Gaza Strip when  .
The blast struck just a hundred metres away from where the family stood, carrying little more than their luggage and the clothes on their backs.
They were among the hundreds of Palestinians attempting to flee into Egypt when an   occurred.
"We only wanted to leave,' Sabreen, an art teacher and resident of   in southern Gaza, told Al Jazeera. 'Even escape seems to be denied for people like us, the Palestinians."
As the Israel-Hamas war stretches into its second week, bombs  on Gaza, a narrow strip of coastal land that is home to more than 2 million Palestinians.
The danger has prompted many families, like Sabreen's, to look abroad for safety. An   on Gaza has left basic supplies scarce, and the Israeli army ordered 1 million people   last week, ahead of an anticipated ground invasion.
But displaced residents are finding access to border crossings   — and perilous.

At the time the bomb exploded at the Rafah crossing, Sabreen's husband Ahmed had been arranging the paperwork for their travel. They had never left Gaza before, and they were focused on the journey ahead, rather than the danger about to rain down from above.
"The ground shook, and we were suddenly enveloped in unconsciousness amidst the swirling sand,' Sabreen said.
Both she and Ahmed fell to the ground. The seconds they spent lying flat felt like an eternity. Scrambling back to their feet, they began the frantic search for their children amid the smoke.
"I couldn't even tell if I was injured or not. All that mattered to me was ensuring the safety of my children. But even that simple task seemed impossible after the air strike," Sabreen recalled.
Chaos spread in the wake of the blast. Children and infants outnumbered adults, according to witnesses, and families rushed to get their paperwork completed, so they could escape the missile barrage by crossing into Egypt.
Ahmed noticed that some bystanders were slightly injured. But, he added, he was "thankful to God that no one was killed'. After the bombing, he and Sabreen said they were   from the border crossing.
"The authorities tried to [tell us] that it was for our safety and that they would reschedule our travel later. But we think we could have gone through,' Sabreen said.
"We were told to go back to Gaza, which means back to the horror and fear and death that we had thought of escaping," she continued, her voice brimming with desperation. "Whose fault is that? We did not even have the psychological strength to argue.'

It was a setback for their plans to cross into Egypt and, from there, travel to Istanbul, where Sabreen's brother lives.
"My brother had sent us tourism visas to lift us from the constant fear and struggle for safety," she said, "When he learned a war had just struck Gaza, he called me and said it is time to get out."
Now, Sabreen, Ahmed and the children are back where they started: in Khan Younis. The family is staying at the home of their relatives, where space is at a premium.
'We are over twenty people in the same apartment," Sabreen said, "holding onto each other's hands and praying for our safety, right where we are."
Their family has deep roots in Gaza. For three generations, the Abd Rabus had grown up living under the same roof, in the same city.
"Even if we could travel, our Palestinian identity would remain unwavering," she said. "We would eventually return to Gaza because it is our home, it is our everything.'
She sees the current conflict as part of a greater effort to expel the Palestinian people from their homeland.
"We understand that Israel, through various means, seeks to displace the Palestinian people from Gaza," Sabreen said. "However, our determination to live here, to exist here and to build our futures here remains unyielding.'
Despite the dire circumstances, Sabreen remains optimistic that her family's struggle will not be in vain.
"Today or a hundred years from now, the Palestinian people will endure," she said. "Resilient and persistent, we refuse to bow to the occupation's tactics of terror and oppression.'

Here isthesituation on  , November 1, 2023:
Latest developments
Palestinian fighters and Israeli forces are engaged in clashes south of the Zeitoun neighbourhood, southeast of Gaza City.
An Israeli ministry has drafted a wartime proposal to transfer the Gaza Strip's 2.3 million people to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office downplayed the report by the Ministry of Intelligence as a hypothetical exercise, a Hamas spokesperson rejected this displacement.
Egypt will allow 81 Palestinians in Gaza, who were severely wounded in the weeks of bombardment, to enter the country for complete treatment, according to the Palestinian border authorities in Gaza. The decision came after Egypt condemned Israel's   on the Jabalia refugee camp.
Human impact and fighting
Up to 400 people were   on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to Hamas. The Ministry of Health said at least 50 people were killed in the attack that triggered a global outrage.
Israel has expanded its ground operations in Gaza recently, with tanks and infantry engaged in battles with Palestinian fighters around the Gaza City in the northern section of the Strip, measuring 10km by 41km (6 miles by 25 miles).
Palestinian Health Ministry spokesperson warned that the main power generators at al-ShifaHospitalcomplex and the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza are hours away from running out of fuel and completely shutting down.
Diplomacy
Bolivia has   with Israel to condemn the Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip. Additionally, Minister of the Presidency Maria Nela Prada announced the country would send humanitarian aid to Gaza.
Two other Latin American countries – Colombia and Chile – have also recalled their ambassadors for consultations to condemn civilian deaths in Gaza and to call for a ceasefire. More than 8,500 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in relentless Israeli bombing since October 7.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Israel on Friday for meetings with members of the government and then make other stops in the region, according to the Department of State.
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates issued individual statements denouncing the strikes on the Jabalia camp.
Escalation in the West Bank
Magdy Zakaria Youssef Awad, 65, a physically impaired man, was killed in the occupied West Bank's eastern district of Tulkarem by Israeli forces, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
Israeli forces have been carrying out regular air raids in the occupied West Bank, including the Jenin refugee camp. Three other people were killed in the West Bank over the past 24 hours, including a 16-year-old.
Wafa reported that Israeli forces raided the house in Tulkarem of freed prisoner, Kassab Zaqout, assaulting and rearresting him.
The death toll in the West Bank has reached 127 since the outbreak of violence on October 7, according to the UN agency OCHA.

Palestinians in Lebanon disappointed that Hezbollah won't escalate

November 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Sabra and Shatila, Lebanon – A week after a much-anticipated speech about Israel's assault on Gaza that did not declare war on Israel, Hezbollah reiterated that message on Saturday.
While it would keep retaliating against Israeli attacks on south Lebanon, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said, the war with Israel would be long and victory would 'take years'.
His message fell short for many Palestinians in Sabra and Shatila, a Palestinian refugee camp that sprawls out across two Beirut neighbourhoods.
'I wanted him to open up the war completely,' said Abdallah*, 25, one of the Palestinians who gathered anxiously at a sidewalk cafe in Sabra and Shatila to watch the speech.
He is one of nearly  250,000 Palestinians languishing in impoverished refugee camps in Lebanon since they were expelled from their homeland during the creation of Israel in 1948.
They have watched, horrified, as Israel systematically and deliberately targeted civilian structures like refugee camps, schools, and hospitals in Gaza.

The attacks have killed more than 11,000 Palestinians – nearly half of them children – and forced hundreds of thousands to flee to the south of Gaza, most of them on foot and often being attacked by Israeli troops even as they fled.
'Hezbollah is fighting and they're trying, but we want them to make more happen,' said Abdallah.
Not enough pressure
Some Palestinians in Lebanon believe that Hezbollah should take the fight to Israel first.
Since Nasrallah's earlier speech on November 4, there has been, an uptick in violence between Hezbollah and Israel in south Lebanon. On November 5, an Israeli rocket killed one woman and three children.
According to an Israeli army spokesperson, Hezbollah   an Israeli – with no information about whether the victim was a soldier or civilian.
Just moments before Nasrallah's speech on November 11, Israel fired  a rocket at a Lebanese village roughly 40km (25 miles) from their shared border.
Then, after the speech, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned that Hezbollah was 'close to making a grave mistake', although it is not clear what he was referring to.
Majdi*, who lives in Shatila, said he is frustrated with Hezbollah.
He expected Hezbollah to assume a more significant role in helping Hamas because the group, he noted, has long posed as a leader of the so-called 'axis of resistance', which includes Iran, Hamas, and other Iran-backed armed groups in the region.
'Nasrallah will escalate against Israel from Lebanon a little bit, but he's not going to be a partner with Hamas in the big and decisive battle in Palestine. He said that himself,' Majdi told Al Jazeera.
Internal pressure
Nicholas Blanford, an expert on Hezbollah with the Atlantic Council think tank, told Al Jazeera that Nasrallah, who is backed by Iran, is clearly considering his domestic situation.
In his speech, Nasrallah said there were 'dissenting voices in Lebanon, but these voices are limited'.
Some Palestinians watching the speech in Sabra and Shatila believe Nasrallah was referring to Samir Geagea, a Christian politician who heads the Lebanese Forces party.
Geagea reportedly told a local television station that Lebanon did not need something 'adding to all the miseries of the Lebanese people' shortly after Hamas's surprise attack on Israel on October 7.
'Dragging Lebanon into a destructive war will do Hezbollah no favours,' Blanford said. 'But the buck stops with Tehran. If the Iranian calculus changes and they want Hezbollah to go [into Israel] full scale, then Nasrallah will have to obey, irrespective of the backlash.'
A significant escalation between Hezbollah and Israel could lead to civil strife in Lebanon and the scapegoating of Palestinians, said Abdallah. But he still wants Hezbollah to take more pressure off Palestinians in Gaza.

'The reason I want Hezbollah to escalate is because all I see is Israel killing children. I'm against killing children, regardless if they're Israeli or Palestinian,' he told Al Jazeera, moments before Nasrallah's speech was broadcast on television.
Managing expectations
Some Palestinians believe Hezbollah is doing more than enough to help Gaza and blame other Arab leaders such as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas for being complicit in Israel's atrocities.
They believe the former has kept the Rafah border crossing with Gaza mostly shut and that the latter has looked to benefit from Israel's war on Hamas.
'Egypt isn't letting in enough food into Gaza or opening its crossing to help Palestinians get out,' said Razan*.
Baha*, also from Shatila, said Nasrallah is at least fighting Israel to some degree.
He adds that Abbas is the biggest traitor to Palestinians for continuing his security cooperation with Israel in the West Bank – a product of the 1993 Oslo Accords – and for offering to play a role in administering Gaza if Israel defeats Hamas.
'Hezbollah can't do it alone,' Baha told Al Jazeera. 'But right now, we all like Nasrallah more than our own Palestinian leader [Abbas].'
* The surnames of these Palestinian interviewees have been withheld due to their concerns for their safety.

Biden condemns Israeli settler attacks in occupied West Bank

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
United States President   has called for an end to escalating attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
Settler violence against Palestinians has intensified since the Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 and Israel's continuing bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip.
Some Palestinians have been killed by settlers, according to Palestinian authorities. Rights groups say settlers have torched cars and attacked several small Bedouin communities, forcing them to evacuate to other areas.
Biden said that attacks by 'extremist settlers' must end.
'It has to stop. They have to be held accountable. It has to stop now,' Biden said on Wednesday.
Settler attacks had been   for months before the current round of fighting between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas, which governs Gaza.
That escalation of violence began on October 7 when Hamas carried out   on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, and captured around 220 others as hostages, according to Israeli authorities.
Since the attack, Israel has imposed a "complete siege" on Gaza and bombarded the territory, where Palestinian authorities say the   has killed at least 6,546 people and wounded more than 17,439.
In the occupied West Bank, tensions have soared as Israel carried out   and stepped up military raids, and settlers have carried out attacks on Palestinians, forcing some communities  .
The West Bank Protection Consortium, a coalition of nongovernment organisations and donor countries, including the European Union, has said that hundreds of Palestinians have been forcibly displaced by settler attacks.
Biden said settler attacks 'pour gasoline' on an already dangerous situation, but did not say what steps, if any, the US would take to pressure Israel to rein in the attacks, which sometimes take place in the presence of  .
Biden casts doubt on Gaza authorities' death toll
The US president also said he had doubts about the accuracy of the death toll from the ongoing fighting reported by Hamas authorities in Gaza.
"I'm sure innocents have been killed and it's the price of waging a war," Biden said.
Khaled Elgindy, a fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institute, said that comment showed that Biden seems unable to empathise with Palestinians.
'I've been saying for years that Biden seems utterly incapable of empathizing w/Palestinians,' Elgindy wrote in a social media post. 'Today he confirmed it.'

Israel 'preparing for ground invasion'
Biden also that he has not directly sought assurances from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel will hold off on an expected ground invasion into Gaza before hostages can be released.
"What I have indicated to him is that if that's possible, to get these folks out safely, that's what he should do. It's their decision," Biden told a news conference. "But I did not demand it. I pointed out to him, if it's real, it should be done."
Earlier on Wednesday, Netanyahu said the decision on when Israeli forces would go into Gaza would be taken by the government's special war cabinet, but he declined to provide any details on the timing or other information about the operation.
"We have already killed thousands of terrorists and this is only the beginning," Netanyahu said in a televised statement.
"Simultaneously, we are preparing for a ground invasion. I will not elaborate on when, how or how many. I will also not elaborate on the various calculations we are making, which the public is mostly unaware of and that is how things should be."

1) Al-Nakba
For Palestinians, 1948 marks the "Nakba" or "catastrophe", when hundreds of thousands were forced out of their homes. For Israelis, the same year marks the creation of their own state. This four-part series attempts to present an understanding of the events of the past that are still shaping the present.
Click   to watch parts 2 to 4 of this documentary.
2) The War in June 1967
The June 1967 war lasted only six days but its consequences are still felt across the region to this day. It redrew the landscape of the conflict, expanded Israel's territorial claims and confirmed its military dominance in the region.
This film examines the roots of the war as well as the six days of conflict and their consequences.
3) The War in October: What Happened in 1973?
The Egyptians call it the October War and the Israelis the Yom Kippur War – a war from which both Arabs and Israelis claimed to emerge victorious.
So what really happened during the three weeks in 1973 that brought the world to the brink of a nuclear confrontation?
Drawing on rare film archives and interviews with people who planned and fought in the battles, this three-part series uses graphic illustrations, maps and animated sequences to show themovements of forces in the many battlefields of the conflict.
Click   to watch parts 2 and 3 of this documentary.
4) The Price of Oslo
This two-part documentary traces the secret road to the Oslo Accords, telling the story of negotiations that took place in the political shadows and a search for common ground amid a region in turmoil. At the centre of it all was an unlikely mediator: the Scandinavian country of Norway.
Click   to watch part 2 of this documentary.
5) Jerusalem: Dividing Al-Aqsa
This film traces the history of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and its significance to both Muslims and Jews.
It also looks at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron - where Israel controls Palestinian access and has imposed access and prayer restrictions - and asks whether this is the shape of things to come at Al-Aqsa.
6) Palestine 1920: The Other Side of the Palestinian Story
'A land without a people, and a people without a land' is how the relationship between Palestine and the Jewish people was described by Christian writers in the 1800s. And the 20th-century history of the Middle East has largely been written through these eyes.
But this film from Al Jazeera Arabic looks at Palestine from a different angle. It hears from historians and witness accounts, and features archive documents that show Palestine as a thriving province of Greater Syria and the Ottoman Empire at the dawn of the 20th century.
7) Gaza, Sinai and the Wall
From 1948 to 1967, residents of Egyptian  and neighbouring  considered the area as a single territory.
But in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War,  captured Sinai and the Gaza Strip.
Twelve years later, Israel and  signed a peace treaty which returned control of Sinai to Egypt; but the Israeli occupation of Gaza continued. In 1982, a wall was built to separate the two territories - a wall which still stands today.
This film tells the story of the Palestinians whose lives were changed by that wall.
8) Israel's Automated Occupation: Hebron
This two-part series examines Israeli surveillance in Hebron and Jerusalem.
The first part explores AI-powered surveillance in Hebron and the previously unknown facial recognition system "Red Wolf", uncovered by Amnesty International and Breaking the Silence.
The second part discusses Israel's surveillance of Palestinians in Jerusalem and the secret Israeli unit responsible for spying on and blackmailing them.
Click   to watch part 2 of this documentary.
9) Weaponising Water in Palestine
Gaza's only freshwater source, the Coastal Aquifer, cannot meet demand and has been depleted by over-extraction and contaminated by sewage. Rising temperatures and sea levels are only making life more difficult, while in Israel, residents do not have to worry about their taps running dry.
This film explores how occupation and the climate crisis have made Palestinians some of the most water-insecure people in the world.
10) Rebel Architecture: The architecture of violence
Israeli architect Eyal Weizman explains how architecture plays a key role in Israel's occupation of Palestine and modern warfare.
'Architecture and the built environment is a kind of slow violence. The occupation is an environment that was conceived to strangulate Palestinian communities, villages and towns, to create an environment that would be unliveable for the people there,' says Weizman.

Blinken reiterates US opposition to Israel or Hamas running post-war Gaza

Gaza cannot be run by either Israel or Hamas once the continuing conflict is over, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said, reiterating the stance of the White House.
Speaking to reporters after G7 foreign ministers held talks in Japan on Wednesday, Blinken listed "key elements" necessary to create "durable peace and security," with the US appearing keen to open a conversation on post-conflict scenarios.
There should be "no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, not now, not after the war; no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism or other violent attacks; no reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends," he stressed.
The US official also warned against an "attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza" or any "reduction in the territory of Gaza".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu   on Monday that Israel would take control of security in Gaza after the war.
However, US officials said the following day that President Joe Biden does not support 'a reoccupation by Israeli forces".
Blinken doubled down on that message. He also reiterated Washington's view that Gaza could not be run by Hamas, the group that currently rules the enclave.
"That simply invites repetition of October 7," he said, referring to the group's deadly attack on Israel that prompted the retaliatory bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 10,000 people in the Palestinian territory.
"Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict … We don't see a reoccupation and what I've heard from Israeli leaders, is that they have no intent to reoccupy Gaza," he added.
'Palestinian affair'
On Tuesday, Hamas said in response to US statements that it could not be part of the ruling equation in the Gaza Strip that the enclave's governance is a 'pure Palestinian affair'.
'Governing Gaza or part of our land is a Palestinian affair, and no force will be able to change reality or impose its will,' Hamas spokesman Abdul-Latif al-Qanou said.
'Hamas is a national liberation movement and resides in every Palestinian home,' al-Qanou said. 'Hamas is an integral part of our people and has the right to resist the occupation in accordance with all laws and customs.'

Gaza war: Biden support plummets to 17 percent among Arab Americans

October 31st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - Arab American support for United States President Joe Biden has plummeted to an all-time low of 17 percent as he continues to back the  , according to a new survey.
The study, released on Tuesday by the Arab American Institute (AAI) think tank, showed a staggering 42-percent drop in support among Arab American communities since 2020, the year of Biden's election.
Respondents also overwhelmingly said they had a negative attitude   with his approval rating tumbling to 29 percent, an 18-percent drop since April.
James Zogby, AAI's president, described the findings as "dramatic".
"The dissatisfaction with President Biden is really quite significant," Zogby said during a virtual briefing. "His numbers are dangerously low, more so than I've ever seen for a Democratic candidate for president."
The study was conducted last week, surveying 500 Arab American respondents.
We did a special poll of #ArabAmericans  since latest outbreak of violence in Palestine/Israel. Consistent with many other voters, poll shows overwhelming opposition to response to crisis. Support for @POTUS  Biden has dropped from 59% in 2020 to 17% today. https://t.co/aD6pl1EaD2 pic.twitter.com/0pwbudYNRk
- Arab American Institute (@AAIUSA) October 31, 2023
The new data coincides with Biden's commitment to "rock-solid and unwavering support" for Israel, as it continues a military operation in Gaza that has killed more than 8,500 Palestinians since October 7.
The Democratic US president is running for reelection, and while the vote is not until November of next year, many Palestinian, Arab and   have pledged not to back him over his stance on the war.
Suehaila Amen — an Arab American activist in Michigan, a state that is home to a large Arab community — told Al Jazeera earlier this week that the growing anger towards the president will likely be felt at the ballot box in 2024.
"We are witnessing a massacre taking place before our very eyes, with the US leadership having absolutely no remorse or compassion or a shared sense of humanity for what's happening," Amen said.
The US provides Israel with more than $3.8bn in military funding each year, but since the war began, Biden has pledged to provide Israel with  , including ammunition and other weapons. The White House has also requested $14bn in additional assistance to Israel from Congress this month.
In addition, critics have said that the Biden administration has alienated Arab American voters by failing to mention — or even dismissing — the Palestinian plight.
"This is war. It is combat. It is bloody. It is ugly. And it's going to be messy, and innocent civilians are going to be hurt going forward," White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said last week.
  the number of Palestinians killed in the conflict, saying that he has "no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using". And his office has been accused of   calls for a ceasefire with anti-Semitism.
One example came on Monday, when White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded to a question about "anti-Israel" demonstrations by drawing a parallel to 2017's deadly white supremacist  , Virginia.
"What I can say is we've been very clear about this: When it comes to anti-Semitism, there is no place," she said, without explicitly mentioning  . "We have to make sure that we speak against it very loud and be very clear about that. Remember, when the president decided to run for president is what he saw in Charlottesville in 2017."
Since the start of the war in Gaza, other public opinion surveys have also shown dissatisfaction with Biden's handling of the crisis.
For example, while the US   to end the fighting, a poll from the progressive think tank Data for Progress showed that most US voters — including an overwhelming majority of Democrats — favour backing a ceasefire in Gaza.
Overall, 66 of respondents said the US should push for a ceasefire. That included 80 percent of Democrats, 57 percent of independents and 56 percent of Republicans. That poll surveyed 1,329 likely voters.

- Data for Progress (@DataProgress) October 20, 2023
Last week, a Gallup poll also showed that Biden's approval dropped 11 percentage points among voters from his own Democratic Party.
It went from 86 percent in September to 75 percent this month. The US president's overall job approval rating was 37 percent.
In a statement announcing the poll's findings, Gallup  noted the war in Gaza as a contributing factor. "Biden has faced criticism from some members of his party for aligning too closely with Israel and not doing enough for the Palestinians," it said.
Analysts have warned that Biden's staunch support for Israel could alienate progressive and young voters, hurting his re-election chances in 2024.
As for Arab Americans, Zogby said on Tuesday that Palestinian rights remain a top issue for them — something that the Biden administration appears to not understand.
"Palestine remains the wound in the heart that doesn't heal. It is as emotionally important to people of Arab descent as   was to Native Americans," he said, referring to the 1890 massacre of Indigenous people in South Dakota.
"That cannot be forgotten. This is a symbol of a hurt. And it's real, and people react viscerally to it."

The head of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency has warned of a "deliberate attempt to strangle" its operations in the Gaza Strip and said it risks shutting down all its humanitarian work because of a lack of fuel.
Israel has refused to allow fuel shipments to the enclave it has besieged, arguing they would be used by the Palestinian group Hamas for military purposes.
The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) supports more than 800,000 displaced people in Gaza. It was at risk of having to suspend its operations entirely, according to its commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini.
"I do believe there is a deliberate attempt to strangle our operation and paralyse the UNRWA operation," Lazzarini said on Thursday at a news conference in Geneva.
"For weeks on end, we have pleaded,  ," he said, adding that in the past few weeks, the agency was able to tap into the remaining fuel reserves in the territory.
'But now we are running out,' he said. "We run the risk of having to suspend the entire humanitarian operation."
Israel   into the Gaza Strip as part of a 'complete siege' on the area after Hamas fighters from Gaza launched an attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
Since the attack, Israel has bombarded the Palestinian territory, launched a ground offensive and severely restricted supplies of water, food and electricity. More than 11,600 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to Palestinian authorities, including more than 4,700 children.
The  to enter Gaza since Israel imposed the siege arrived on Wednesday.
UNRWA said it had received 23,000 litres (6,075 gallons) of fuel. However, Israeli authorities have restricted its use exclusively for the transport of aid delivered from Egypt.
Lazzarini said 160,000 litres (42,000 gallons) a day are needed just to run basic humanitarian operations.
"I do believe that it is outrageous that humanitarian agencies have been reduced to begging for fuel," he told reporters.
Lazzarini said humanitarian conditions have now severely deteriorated as 70 percent of the   has no access to clean water, and raw sewage has started flowing onto the streets.
Fuel is needed to operate water desalination plants, the sewage pumping system and bakeries.

Earlier on Thursday, Palestinian telecommunications companies Jawwal and Paltel announced their network went out of service in Gaza as 'all energy sources sustaining it' were depleted, plunging the enclave into a near-total communications blackout and seriously hampering the work of first responders and emergency services.
"It can provoke or accelerate [the breakdown of the] last remaining civil order we have in the Gaza Strip," Lazzarini said of the blackout, calling the   in Gaza "just staggering".
UNRWA said the telecommunications outage 'makes it impossible to manage or coordinate humanitarian aid convoys'. It said its cross-border aid operation at the   – the only one open for aid deliveries – would be suspended on Friday.
From our #Gaza  team @TomWhite :
There will NOT be a cross-border aid operation at the Rafah Crossing tomorrow.
The communications network in #Gaza  is down because there is NO fuel.
This makes it impossible to manage or coordinate humanitarian aid convoys. pic.twitter.com/Kaj8z0lE9f
- UNRWA (@UNRWA) November 16, 2023
Lazzarini said fuel was being used as a 'weapon of war'.
"Today what we are saying is if the fuel does not come in, people will start to die because of the lack of fuel," he said.

The Palestinian armed group Hamas has released 24 hostages held captive by the group in Gaza for almost seven weeks, according to Qatar's foreign ministry and the International Red Cross, hours after an Israel-Hamas truce mediated by Qatar came into effect.
Among the captives released were 13 Israelis, 10 Thai nationals and one Filipino citizen, Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry in Qatar, said on Friday.
The ICRC in Israel and the occupied territories said that it transported the group of hostages from Gaza to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.
"We are relieved to confirm the safe release of 24 hostages," the ICRC wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
"We have facilitated this release by transporting them from Gaza to the Rafah border, marking the real-life impact of our role as a neutral intermediary between the parties."
The release of the 24 captives — out of the roughly 240 taken hostage by Hamas during an assault on southern Israel on October 7 — comes as a deal between  , which includes a four-day truce and exchange of captives for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, takes effect.
Later on Friday, Qatar said 39 Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli jails were released as part of the deal.
The ICRC confirmed on Friday that its teams were facilitating the release and transfer of hostages held in Gaza and of Palestinian detainees.
"The deep pain that family members separated from their loved ones feel is indescribable. We are relieved that some will be reunited after long agony," said Fabrizio Carboni, the International Committee of the Red Cross's regional director for the Near and Middle East.
According to the deal mediated by Qatar, Hamas will release 50 women and children, from about 240 people   by the group during its assault on southern Israel on October 7.
In exchange, Israel will release a total of 150 Palestinian women and children held in  , whom Palestinians have long characterised as victims of an Israeli occupation that sweeps them into prisons with little pretence of due process.
The captives taken by Hamas on October 7 include Israeli soldiers and civilians, as well as people from dozens of foreign countries. In both Israel and abroad, the families of those held captive   for their release.
Qatar's al-Ansari said that the 10 Thai nationals and Filipino citizen were freed outside the framework of the truce deal.
Earlier on Friday, Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said 12 Thai nationals help captive in Gaza had been released.
"It has been confirmed by the security side and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that 12 Thai hostages are already released," he posted on X.
According to Thailand's foreign ministry, about 30,000 Thais were employed in Israel, primarily in the country's agricultural sector, at the time of the attack, in which at least 32 Thai workers were killed. Thais seeking work overseas often come to Israel under an arrangement in which they are paid minimum wage of about $2,000 a month.

November 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
French President Emmanuel Macron has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu there were "too many civilian losses" in Israel's war in Gaza, as Paris readied more humanitarian aid for the besieged enclave.
Israel has said it wants to destroy the Palestinian armed group after it killed about 1,200 people and took hundreds more   in a surprise assault on October 7.
More than 13,000 people in Gaza, some 70 percent of them women and children according to the United Nations, have been   in the air and land offensive.  , schools and refugee settlements have also come under sustained attack.
According to a statement from Macron's office on Sunday, the French president reminded Netanyahu of the "absolute necessity to distinguish terrorists from the population" and "the importance of achieving an immediate humanitarian truce leading to a ceasefire".
Macron also condemned violence against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, the statement said. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed there since Israel began its war in Gaza.
The French leader told Netanyahu about his "great concern over the escalation in violence against Palestinian civilians" in the occupied West Bank and called for calm.
Macron also spoke to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who is from the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank.
He told Abbas of "the need for the Palestinian Authority and all countries in the region to unequivocally and with the greatest firmness condemn the terrorist attack carried out by Hamas in Israel on October 7".
Earlier on Sunday, Macron announced new humanitarian assistance for Gaza where there are growing fears of starvation.
The president said France would send an aircraft with more than 10 tonnes of medical supplies at the start of the week, and will contribute to European Union medical aid flights on November 23 and 30.
It is also preparing a second hospital ship, the helicopter carrier Dixmude, which will arrive in Egypt in the coming days.
The French helicopter carrier – the Tonnerre, which has about 60 beds and two operating theatres – has already been deployed to the region.
The statement added that "France is mobilising all its available means to contribute to the evacuation of wounded and sick children requiring emergency care from the Gaza Strip to its hospitals".
Macron said later on X, formerly Twitter, that up to 50 children could be flown for treatment in hospitals in France "if useful and necessary".
Earlier this month, French planes delivered 54 tonnes ofaid for Gazavia Egypt.

Hamas says it has enough Israeli captives to free all Palestinian prisoners

October 7th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A senior Hamas leader has said that the group had captured enough Israeli soldiers during an   against Israel to make Israeli authorities free all Palestinian prisoners in its jails.
"We managed to kill and capture many Israeli soldiers. The fighting is still on," Saleh al-Arouri, deputy chief of Hamas's political bureau, told Al Jazeera on Saturday.
"Our detainees in [Israeli] prisons, their freedom is looming large. What we have in our hands will release all our prisoners. The longer fighting continues, the higher the number of prisoners will become," added al-Arouri, who said senior officers were among those captured, but did not provide any figures.
According to the latest figures by Addameer, a prisoners' rights NGO, nearly 5,200 Palestinians are in Israeli jails, including 33 women, 170 minors and more than 1,200 placed under administrative detention.
The Israeli army has acknowledged soldiers and commanders have been killed and prisoners of war have been taken. It has not given any figures.
Hamas, the group running the besieged Gaza Strip, launched the biggest operation on Israel in years on Saturday, killing dozens of people and wounding hundreds after fighters crossed into Israel under the cover of a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas social media accounts posted footage of what were said to be Israeli captives moved alive into the Gaza Strip.
The surprise operation from Gaza came on the heels of the killing of four Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, widespread Israeli settler attacks, especially in  , near Nablus and increased tensions at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem.
The Israeli military launched air raids on the Gaza Strip, killing at least 198 Palestinians and wounding hundreds of others, according to the enclave's ministry of health.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, al-Arouri said the group is engaged in a battle for freedom.
"This is not a [hit-and-run] operation; we started an all-out battle. We expect fighting to continue and the fighting front to expand. We have one prime target: our freedom and the freedom of our holy sites," he told Al Jazeera.
Al-Arouri said Palestinians have a right to freedom, to fight the Israeli occupation and to safeguard their holy sites.
"We will continue to fight until we are rewarded with victory, freedom and independence," he said.
As observers noted that a land invasion by Israel could be imminent, Hamas said it is ready for "the worst-case scenario".
"All scenarios are now possible and we are ready for an [Israeli] land invasion," he added.
Al-Arouri also said that Israel had been planning to launch an attack on the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is "at war", while Palestinian officials say ending the Israeli occupation of their territory is the only guarantee for "security, stability and peace" in the region.
The US, meanwhile, said it will work to ensure Israel "has what it needs to defend itself" and the UK, EU and Ukraine have condemned Hamas's operation in Israel.

Saudi Arabia puts Israel deal on ice amid war, engages with Iran: Report

October 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Saudi Arabia is putting United States-backed plans to normalise ties with Israel on ice, two sources familiar with Riyadh's thinking told Reuters news agency, signalling a rapid rethink of its foreign policy priorities   between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas.
The conflict has also pushed the kingdom to engage with Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman took his first phone call from Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi as Riyadh tries to prevent a broader surge in violence across the region.
The two sources told Reuters there would be a delay in the US-backed talks on normalisation with Israel which was a key step for the kingdom to secure what Riyadh considers the real prize of a US defence pact in exchange.
Until Iran-backed Hamas sparked a war on October 7 by launching a devastating attack on Israel, both Israeli and Saudi leaders had been saying they were moving steadily towards a deal that could have reshaped the Middle East.
Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and home to its two holiest sites, had until the latest conflict indicated it would not allow its pursuit of a US defence pact to be derailed even if Israel did not offer significant concessions to the Palestinians in their bid for statehood, sources had previously said.
But an approach that sidelined Palestinians would risk angering Arabs around the region, as Arab news outlets broadcast images of Palestinians killed in Israeli retaliatory air strikes.
Hamas fighters killed more than 1,300 Israelis in their October 7 attack and more than 1,952 Palestinians had been killed by Friday in Israel's continuing strikes on Gaza in response.
The first source familiar with Riyadh's thinking said talks could not be continued for now and the issue of Israeli concessions for the Palestinians would need to be a bigger priority when discussions resumed – a comment that indicates Riyadh has not abandoned the idea.
The Saudi government did not respond to Reuters' emailed requests for comment.
'Considered taboo'
The Saudi rethink highlights challenges facing Washington's efforts to deepen Israel's integration in a region where the Palestinian cause remains a major Arab concern.
"Normalisation was already considered taboo [in the Arab world] … this war only amplifies that," Saudi Arabia analyst Aziz Alghashian said.
Washington wants to build on the Abraham Accords in which some Gulf states, including the United Arab Emirates, normalised ties.
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told a White House briefing this week that the normalisation effort was "not on hold" but said the focus was on other immediate challenges.
The first source familiar with Saudi thinking said Washington had pressed Riyadh this week to condemn the Hamas attack but said Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan pushed back. A US source familiar with the issue confirmed this.
The regional conflict has also prompted the Saudi crown prince and Iran's president to speak for the first time after a Chinese-brokered initiative prompted the Gulf rivals to   in April.
A Saudi statement said the crown prince told Raisi "the kingdom is exerting maximum effort to engage with all international and regional parties to halt the ongoing escalation", underlining Riyadh's move to contain the crisis.
A senior Iranian official told Reuters the call, made by Raisi to the crown prince, aimed to support "Palestine and prevent the spread of war in the region".
"The call was good and promising," the official said.
A second Iranian official said the call lasted 45 minutes and had the blessing of Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei.
De-escalating tensions
The Saudi government did not provide further details on the call but in its statement said the crown prince stated the kingdom's "opposition to any form of civilian targeting and the loss of innocent lives" and expressed Riyadh's "unwavering stance in standing up for the Palestinian cause".
Saudi Arabia has been seeking to ease tensions elsewhere in the Middle East, including seeking to end a conflict in Yemen, where Riyadh has led a military coalition in a war against the Iran-aligned Houthis.
Asked about Raisi's call with the crown prince, a senior US State Department official said Washington was in "constant contact with Saudi leaders". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has held several calls with his Saudi counterpart.
The official said Washington was asking partners with channels to Hamas, Hezbollah – a Lebanese armed group aligned with Tehran that fought a war with Israel in 2006 – or Iran "to get Hamas to stand down from its attacks, to release hostages, keep Hezbollah out (and) keep Iran out of the fray".
The first source familiar with Saudi thinking said Gulf states, including those with Israeli ties, were worried Iran could be drawn into a conflict that would affect them.
Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran programme at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said the last week showed how the Saudi and Iranian visions for the region diverged.
"The Saudis are still convinced the region, and Saudi Arabia itself needs to shift toward regional cooperation and economic development. Iran seems to think the priority is to take the fight to the Israelis first," he said.

Israeli minister supports 'voluntary migration' of Palestinians in Gaza

Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich says he supports the 'voluntary migration' of Palestinians in Gaza, calling it the 'right humanitarian solution' for the besieged enclave and for the region.
Smotrich's comments come after US lawmakers Danny Danon, the former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, and Ram Ben-Barak, former deputy director of the intelligence agency Mossad, published a comment piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday suggesting moving some of Gaza's population to nations that will accept them.
'I welcome the initiative of members of KnessetRam Ben-Barakand Danny Danon on the voluntary immigration of Gaza Arabs to the countries of the world. This is the right humanitarian solution for the residents of Gaza and the entire region,' Smotrich wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
'A cell with a small area like the Gaza Strip, without natural resources and independent sources of livelihood, has no chance to exist independently, economically and politically, in such a high density for a long time.
'The reception of refugees by the countries of the world that really want their best interests, with the support and generous financial assistance of the international community, and within the state of Israel is the only solution that will bring to the end of the suffering and pain of Jews and Arabs alike.'
'The State of Israel will no longer be able to put up with the existence of an independent entity in Gaza,' he added.
In response to his comments, Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, said in a post on X that the minister 'revealed the real policy and intentions of the Israeli government'.
'  himself said in the beginning of the Israeli war on Gaza that all Gazans must evict their homes. Ethnic cleansing is a war crime and it is done by bombarding an unprotected civilian population.'
Smotrich revealed the real policy and intentions of the Israeli government. Netanyahu himself said in the beginning of the Israeli war on Gaza that all Gazans must evict their homes. Ethnic cleansing is a war crime and it is done by bombarding unprotected civilian population
- Mustafa Barghouti @Mustafa_Barghouti (@MustafaBarghou1) November 14, 2023
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu   previously lobbied European leaders to help him convince the Egyptian president to take in refugees from Gaza. Israel's Ministry of Intelligence had also outlined a proposal to 'evacuate' all Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt.
In March, Smotrich received  after saying the Palestinian people are 'an invention' of the past century, with Palestinian officials blasting his comments as proof of the 'racist' outlook of Israel's far-right government.
In their article on Monday, Danon and Ben-Barak said Europe had a long history of assisting refugees fleeing conflicts, and off of that example, 'countries around the world should offer a haven for Gaza residents who seek relocation'.
'Countries can accomplish this by creating well-structured and internationally coordinated relocation programs,' they wrote.
A majority of Palestinians were expelled from their homeland in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel — an event they refer to as the Nakba, or 'catastrophe'.
Most people in Gaza today are the children or grandchildren of those displaced during the Nakba. They now risk being permanently uprooted again, which is a war crime under international law.

October 26th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United Nations Security Council failed to adopt a resolution on the ongoing situation in Gaza after two competing draft resolutions were rejected by member states on Wednesday.
Russia and China vetoed a US-drafted resolution that called for 'humanitarian pauses' and Israel's right to defend itself. A second draft resolution sponsored by Russia, which called for a humanitarian ceasefire, failed to garner enough votes to pass. The United States was expected to veto the resolution had it garnered enough votes to put it on the path to approval.
The two resolutions   at the UN headquarters in New York after an intense open debate by members on 'the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question'.
This was the second UNSC draft resolution put to vote since the Israel-Palestine war started three weeks ago. The first one was held on October 18, when the US   calling for 'humanitarian pauses'. Twelve countries voted in favour.
A history of US vetoes protecting Israel
The US response to the UNSC resolutions amid this conflict is in line with its historical use of its veto power to block any resolutions that might be critical of Israel or call for Palestinian statehood.
Since 1945, a total of 36 UNSC draft resolutions related to Israel-Palestine have been vetoed by one of the five permanent members – the US, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France. Out of these, 34 were vetoed by the US and two by Russia and China.
The majority of these resolutions were drafted to provide a framework for peace in the decades-long Israel-Palestine conflict, including asking Israel to adhere to international laws, calling for self-determination for Palestinian statehood, or condemning Israel for the displacement of Palestinians or settlement building in occupied Palestinian territories.
(Al Jazeera)
The US has vetoed resolutions on Israel a total of 46 times, including over Israel's invasion of southern Lebanon as well as Israel's annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights, which remains under Israeli occupation. Washington   over the Golan Heights, reversing decades of US policy.
The 1972 draft resolution – the only time the US did not veto – was brief and generic, calling upon all sides to 'cease immediately all military operations and to exercise the greatest restraint in the interest of international peace and security'.
Key resolutions blocked by the US
The October 18, 2023 resolution calling for 'humanitarian pauses' and for Israel to rescind its evacuation order for northern Gaza was blocked. The US ambassador to the UN said: 'Yes, resolutions are important, and yes, this Council must speak out. But the actions we take must be informed by the facts on the ground and support direct diplomacy that can save lives.'
After the Great March of Return, in 2018, the UNSC drafted a resolution condemning 'the use of any excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force by the Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians' and calling for 'lasting, comprehensive peace' with 'two democratic States, Israel and Palestine'. The US vetoed the resolution, with then-US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley saying it presented 'a grossly one-sided view of what has taken place in Gaza in recent weeks'.
After the US recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in 2017, a draft resolution said 'actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void'. It demanded the status of Jerusalem to be determined in line with UN regulations. All of the 15 UNSC members voted in favour except the US, which vetoed it.
Following the second Intifada or uprising that started in 2000, a UNSC resolution expressed 'grave concern at the continuation of the tragic and violent events that have taken place since September 2000', condemned attacks against civilians and called for Israel 'to abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention'. Then-US Ambassador to the UN John Negroponte said the resolution intended to 'isolate politically one of the parties to the conflict through an attempt to throw the weight of the Council behind the other party'. Twelve countries voted in favour, but the US vetoed.

'Important but not enough': What does Israel-Hamas deal mean for US policy?

November 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - The agreement between Israel and Hamas to pause the fighting in Gaza and release dozens of captives highlights the power of diplomacy and creates an opening to end  , advocates in the United States say.
But they stress that the truce is not sufficient, with many pledging to continue pressuring the administration of US President Joe Biden to  .
"This is an important break in the fighting. It's important that these families are reunified," said Hassan El-Tayyab, legislative director for Middle East policy at the advocacy group Friends Committee on National Legislation.
"But it's not enough. We have to continue building momentum to reach a permanent ceasefire, a return of all the hostages, unfettered aid access and a solution for peace for Israelis and Palestinians."
The deal   release 50 women and children held in Gaza, and Israel free 150 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. The exchange will be accompanied by a four-day pause in the fighting and an increased delivery of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian territory.
The agreement, which was approved by the Israeli government late on Tuesday, is expected to go into effect on Thursday. It marks the first stop in the fighting since the war broke out.
Biden welcomes deal
Israel has pledged to continue its military campaign after the pause. But El-Tayyab stressed that "more war" is not the answer, and that there is no military solution to the crisis.
"The question is: Will we fall back to where we were for the past six weeks, with indiscriminate bombing and civilians dying and the hostages being held?" he told Al Jazeera.
"Or are we going to take a step forward towards more negotiations, an extended truce, to get everybody home and finally resolve some of the underlying issues that are creating the cycles of violence, which include   of Palestinians?"
President   welcomed the deal and thanked Qatar and Egypt for helping to broker it. He also applauded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement  on Wednesday.
"I appreciate the commitment that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government have made in supporting an extended pause to ensure this deal can be fully carried out and to ensure the provision of additional humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of innocent Palestinian families in Gaza," Biden said. He did not comment on the future of the conflict.
The Biden administration has been calling for "humanitarian pauses" in the war while firmly rejecting demands for a ceasefire, at least until Israel achieves its stated goal of eliminating Hamas.
A truce or a pause is a temporary halt of fighting for an agreed-upon period of time — in this case, four days. A ceasefire is an indefinite end to hostilities that often comes with a negotiated agreement between the warring parties.
Nancy Okail, president of the Center for International Policy, a US-based think tank, called the truce a "step in the right direction".
She said the pause could be used to   to Palestinians in Gaza, push for a lasting ceasefire and ensure the safety of humanitarian workers, medics and journalists.
"This would be important not just for the immediate objective of helping secure the release of the hostages but also to save lives and stop the bloodshed," Okail told Al Jazeera.
'Allow the truth to come out'
More than 14,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive in response to the October 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 Israelis.
Hamas also took more than 200 people captive from Israel. Thousands of Palestinians are in Israeli jails, including hundreds of children, many of whom are held in so-called   without formal charges.
The scale of the violence in Gaza has prompted many scholars and United Nations experts to warn of the risk of genocide.
The Israeli army has forcibly displaced most of the population in the north of the territory — more than one million residents — raising concerns about the possible   of Palestinians, especially if they are not allowed to return to their homes.
Okail said the halt in violence should extend to the West Bank, where more than 200 Palestinians have   by Israeli forces and settlers since October 7.
If the fighting resumes, Okail also explained that she would like to see the US take a firm stance against any war crimes, including the use of collective punishment, civilian hostages and indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas.
"The Biden administration should also draw a clear red line around the use of US-supplied arms and make clear that there will be consequences if those weapons are not used in accordance with international law," Okail added.
The White House and Pentagon have repeatedly said that they would not draw any "red lines" to restrict the Israeli operation in Gaza and how American arms are used.
Israel receives $3.8bn in US aid annually. Biden is seeking more than $14bn in   for Israel this year.
Leading rights groups like Amnesty International, however, have accused Israel of imposing apartheid on Palestinians. But the appeals for Biden to rein in Israeli abuses appear to be going unheard.
Politico reported  late on Tuesday that the Biden administration is concerned that the pause "would allow journalists broader access to Gaza and the opportunity to further illuminate the devastation there and turn public opinion on Israel".
Against that backdrop, El-Tayyab called for independent observers to assess the carnage of Gaza.
"We need to allow the truth to come out. If the truth leads the public to say: This is a war we don't want to be a part of, then we have to let the chips fall where they may," he told Al Jazeera.
'No backbone whatsoever'
Rights advocates have also expressed fear that renewed bombing after the truce might target southern Gaza, which has become   since the start of the war, as families flee bombings and other attacks.
But Biden's support for Israel is not expected to waver after the pause.
​​Juan Cole, professor of history at the University of Michigan, said Biden's green light for the war is one of the main reasons the Israeli campaign "has gone on for this unspeakably long period".
"My reading of the Netanyahu government is that they're incorrigible, that nothing would stand in their way if they want to start back up the destruction," Cole told Al Jazeera.
"And then   has shown himself to have no backbone whatsoever when trying to stand up to Netanyahu."
Cole noted that Netanyahu has been under pressure from the captives' families to accept the deal, despite opposition from his far-right political allies. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, for instance, called the agreement "immoral".
Despite the push in some right-wing circles for the relentless bombing to continue, Israel does not appear close to destroying Hamas. The Palestinian group continues to fight Israeli troops in northern Gaza, killing dozens of soldiers since the ground invasion began.
Hamas's top political and military leadership remains intact as well.
It's not clear how and if Israel can eliminate   and what would come after the group if it were destroyed. Hamas has controlled Gaza since 2007.
That's why many progressive activists in the US are urging a political solution to end the violence — one that goes beyond the current deal.
Usamah Andrabi, communications director at Justice Democrats, a progressive group, called for the US to end its unconditional support for the Israeli government that "continues to openly tell us its plans to annihilate   the Palestinian people".
Andrabi said the pause is a temporary but necessary reprieve from the "incessant bombing and destruction by the Israeli government", which will allow for the release of captives.
"But we cannot let up on our demands for a permanent ceasefire," Andrabi told Al Jazeera.
Sandra Tamari, the executive director of Adalah Justice Project, an advocacy group, echoed Andrabi's comments. She said the halt is simply a "pause of genocide".
"How can we settle for a pause to that kind of violence? We have to continue to push the US government to call for a complete ceasefire," Tamari told Al Jazeera.

What has been US President Biden's stance on Israel-Gaza war so far?

October 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
United States President Joe Biden has joined world leaders in expressing 'outrage' over a   in Gaza, which has been under non-stop bombing by Israel for the past 12 days.
"The United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients, medical staff and other innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy," Biden posted on X, formerly Twitter, before landing in Israel on Wednesday morning.
At a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Biden reiterated continued US support to Israel, Washington's closest ally in the Middle East, despite the horrific bombing of the hospital. The Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 3,300 Palestinians came in response to a deadly attack by the Hamas group on October 7.
So what has been Biden's stance on the Israel-Palestine war so far?
What did Biden say in Israel?
Biden told Netanyahu that the al-Ahli Arab Hospital bombing appears to have been committed by the 'other team, not you', implying Palestinian armed factions were behind it. Biden did not provide any evidence to back up his assessment.
Israel has blamed a misfired rocket launched by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an allegation that the group has denied.
Palestinian officials have said the bombing was carried out by Israel, and initial estimates point out that 500 people have been killed there.
I am outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted. Immediately upon hearing this news, I spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and have directed my national
- President Biden (@POTUS) October 17, 2023
"When the Americans said that their national security team would investigate the cause of the Gaza hospital explosion on Tuesday night, many thought there will be an extensive inquiry," Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Tel Aviv, said.
"But it appears that President Biden has already decided who is behind the deadly attack."
Biden did express deep outrage at what occurred.
The US president said on Wednesday that Washington would provide Israel with everything it needed to defend itself amid the continuing war in Gaza, adding that 31 Americans were among the more than 1,400 people killed inside Israel in the Hamas attack.
"This visit is a significant display of support for the Israelis. By asserting that a misfiring rocket caused the hospital carnage, Biden has effectively given Israel the green light to act as it sees fit," Al Jazeera's Fisher said.
What has been Biden's stance on Israel?
Since the October 7 Hamas attack, the US president's rhetoric has been focused on supporting Israel.
During his first speech on the day of the incident, and in numerous talks and statements that have followed, Biden has first and foremost focused on Israel's 'right to defend itself' against Hamas, which is designated as a 'terrorist' group by Israel and its Western allies.
'Let me be crystal clear, the United States stands with Israel,' Biden said on October 7. 'Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop.' He has repeated his unqualified support for Israel several times since.
On October 10, Biden signed a joint statement with his top European counterparts to condemn the killing of civilians and taking of captives by Hamas.
"We make clear that the terrorist actions of Hamas have no justifications, no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned," the joint statement said.
"All of us recognise the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and support equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike," it said, without calling for a ceasefire in Gaza where nearly 800 people were killed by then.
Has Biden called for a ceasefire?
Not really. He has stayed away from seeking accountability from the Israelis regarding the indiscriminate bombardments of civilians, hospitals and schools.
And instead, has continued to focus on Israel's security. His administration has   in support of Israel. The US fears regional armed groups such Iran-backed Hezbollah might open a second front for Israeli on the Israel-Lebanon border.
Biden has also avoided talking about the massive humanitarian toll of Israel's ongoing attacks on Gaza, which the United Nations and rights groups have expressed serious concern about.
The US president has also been silent on Israel cutting off water, electricity and internet in the besieged enclave of 2.3 million people. The Israeli order for 1.1 million Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza to make room for a looming ground offensive has also failed to draw Biden's attention.
Did the US president call for humanitarian aid?
But in the past week, his rhetoric has expanded to include the humanitarian aspect without explicitly discussing Israel's role.
'The US is working with the governments of Israel, Egypt, Jordan — and with the UN — to surge support to ease the humanitarian consequences of Hamas's attack, create conditions needed to resume the flow of assistance, and advocate for the upholding of the law of war,' his account wrote on X on October 14.
But the explosion at the hospital has already had diplomatic consequences for Biden. Jordan, which was also supposed to host Biden for a summit with the country's King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, has called off the meetings. Biden is no longer welcome in Amman at the moment.
Biden's comments on October 11 that he saw images of babies that were beheaded by Hamas during its assault, was walked back by the   The unfounded story of "beheaded babies" was widely circulated on social media and some US networks fuelling anti-Muslim sentiments.
Has Biden spoken out against Islamophobia?
Earlier this week, a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy was  , a 71-year-old man, in what is being seen as a hate crime.
Biden condemned the killing. "As Americans, we must come together and reject Islamophobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred. I have said repeatedly that I will not be silent in the face of hate," he posted on X.
The US leader has repeatedly said that 'there is no place for hate in America' amid reports of increasing hate crimes in the US based on religion. He has condemned both anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim sentiments rising on the back of the conflict.
"History has taught us again and again that antisemitism, Islamophobia, and all hate are connected," Biden tweeted before his trip to the US.
"We have to reject hate in every form."

PA forces fire tear gas at West Bank protesters after Gaza hospital strike

October 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Hundreds of protesters have rallied in the occupied West Bank after Palestinian officials said an Israeli air raid killed hundreds of people at a hospital in Gaza.
The strike on Gaza's Al-Ahli al-Arab Hospital, which officials said killed about 500 people, was the deadliest single incident in Gaza since Israel launched a brutal campaign of air raids on the Palestinian territory after a deadly Hamas gun rampage through Israeli communities.
The Israeli military denied responsibility for the air attack and said it was caused by a failed rocket launch by a Palestinian armed group.
Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the reports.
In the city of Ramallah,   (PA) security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse protesters on Tuesday.
"The people want the fall of the president," some demonstrators chanted. Some protesters voiced their support for Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza.
Witnesses reported protests in other cities across the West Bank, including Nablus, Tubas and Jenin, a northern city that was the focus of extensive Israeli military operations earlier this year.
The outbreak of West Bank protests highlights long-simmering Palestinian anger against PA President Mahmoud Abbas, whose forces have long faced criticism for coordinating with Israel on security in the territory.
Hussein al-Sheikh, a senior Palestinian official, has said that Abbas will return to the West Bank 'immediately'.
Abbas has also cancelled a planned meeting with United States President Joe Biden, who is scheduled to arrive in the region on Wednesday in a show of support for Israel after Hamas carried out a   on October 7 that killed at least 1,400 people, according to Israeli authorities.
Since the Hamas attack, Israel has pounded the besieged Gaza Strip in a relentless air bombardment that has killed more than 3,000 Palestinians, wounded more than 10,000 others and levelled entire residential neighbourhoods.
Tensions have   in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians and   more than 600 people.
The Palestinian health ministry has reported that 61 people have been killed and 1,250 injured in the occupied West Bank since October 7.

Spain's Ione Belarra: Israel must end 'genocide' of Palestinians in Gaza

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Madrid, Spain – In an interview with Al Jazeera, a Spanish minister has called on the international community to sanction Israel, which she accused of a "planned genocide" of Palestinians in Gaza.
 , the Spanish minister for social rights and leader of the far-left Podemos party, also condemned world leaders for an apparent double standard – saying while human rights abuses in Ukraine have been decried, there is a "deafening silence" on the victims of Israeli bombardment.
'The Israeli state must end this planned genocide against the Palestine people,' Belarra said on Wednesday.
'Why can we give lessons in human rights in other conflicts and not here when the world is watching in horror? The deaths of thousands of children, the mothers desperately shouting because they are witnessing the killing of their children.
"There is a deafening silence of so many countries and so many political leaders who could do something. I speak about what I know well, which is the  . It seems the display of hypocrisy which the European Commission is showing is unacceptable.'
Spain and other nations should break off diplomatic relations with Israel in protest of its assault on Gaza, she insisted.
On October 7, the Palestinian group Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, carried out an unprecedented attack in Israel, killing more than 1,000 Israelis and taking hundreds captive.
With the stated aim to crush Hamas, Israel began bombarding Gaza, one of the world's most densely populated areas, killing more than 10,000 people, including many children.
Spain's citizens have been caught on both sides of the crisis.
El Pais newspaper, citing diplomatic sources, has reported that the Spanish citizen Ivan Illarramendi, who was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, has died. He was living in a kibbutz.
Spain is also among the Western nations trying to evacuate some of its citizens from Gaza.
Europe 'losing opportunity' to take action
Soon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February last year, the European Union was quick to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin and his aides.
Belarra suggested the EU mirror its "fast action" in the case of against Israel.
'They reacted [over the Ukraine war].
"We are losing the opportunity. At the moment, we could do lots of things," she said, including economic sanctions on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who she described as a "war criminal", and his political circle.
The politicians responsible for "pushing the button" should be brought before the International Criminal Court and tried for approving bombing campaigns that target civilian populations – "a flagrant breach of human rights", she said.
'I am demanding my country and other countries break diplomatic relations with Israel. I think this would send the right political message which is we don't want to have anything to do with this war criminal like this leader,' she said.
'We have to act and we have to be more firm despite the fact [that Israel] is very powerful and has powerful friends.'
Belarra's party, Podemos, is the junior partner in Spain's acting left-wing coalition government, which is led by the Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Snchez.
Spain has demanded the release of more than 200 hostages taken during the Hamas attack and called for a truce. It is also calling for humanitarian aid to be delivered to Gaza, where food has become scare and health and water services are on the brink of collapse.
Jos Manuel Albares, the Spanish foreign minister, told Spanish television RTVE on Wednesday that Madrid will double aid for the civilian population of Gaza to $43m.
'More dignified position'
The war has polarised political parties across Europe, and seen thousands of protesters take to the streets across the continent to demand a ceasefire.
A series of pro-Palestinian marches have taken place in Madrid, Barcelona, and other Spanish cities in recent weeks without any official restrictions.
Spain has a large Muslim population of about two million people, according to government statistics. About 50,000 Jewish people also live in the country.
Spain's stance over public activism about the Israel-Hamas war has differed from neighbouring France, which has banned pro-Palestinian marches. Germany and the United Kingdom have also cracked down on pro-Palestinian activism.
Belarra condemned European governments, without naming them, for 'criminalising' the pro-Palestinian movement.
'The [Spanish] government is maintaining a more dignified position than other countries of the European community, which are criminalising the pro-Palestinian movement, banning demonstrations. What I want is that Spain does more, that Spain does all it can,' she said.
Ignacio Molina, a foreign policy expert at the Autonomous University of Madrid, said Spain is somewhat of an outlier in Europe for its position on Palestine, but stressed that Belarra's views differ from the government, whose line has been more balanced.
'Spain has a good relationship with Israel, but like Ireland and some other European countries, it is among the more sympathetic towards the Palestinian cause,' he told Al Jazeera.
'Spain only started diplomatic relations with Israel in 1986, but it has made sympathetic gestures towards Israel, like offering Spanish citizenship to Sephardic Jews.'
In 2015, the Spanish government announced Sephardic Jews, who were expelled from Spain in 1492, were to be offered citizenship as a way of atoning for the expulsion by Catholic monarchs.
On Tuesday, Spain honoured United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has been criticised by Israel over his remarks that the Hamas attacks 'did not happen in a vacuum'.

EU's Palestine envoy: Bloc lacks sympathy for victims of Israel's bombing

October 19th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Brussels, Belgium – After   were killed at a Gaza hospital this week, Abdalrahim Alfarra, the head of the Palestinian Mission to the European Union, Belgium and Luxembourg, had a dream.
"I had a dream that the president of the EU Council, the Parliament and the Commission would all be standing holding Palestinian flags on Wednesday morning, and holding a minute of silence in solidarity with the Palestinians massacred at the hospital, and over the past decades," he told Al Jazeera.
"But I was very disturbed when I woke up, realising it was just a dream. And it will only remain a dream."
After Hamas's unprecedented deadly assault in Israel, top EU officials held vigils in Brussels to remember the Israeli victims of the attacks, as   were draped in the white and blue of Israel's flag.
But Alfarra said there is little sympathy for the thousands of Palestinians who have died since, as Israel relentlessly bombards Gaza, the besieged Palestinian strip he hails from.
His daughter, mother, brothers and other relatives are in Gaza now, struggling to survive.
He holds the EU accountable for its "silence" over the "massacre" of Gazans.
The details around Tuesday's explosion at al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City are still being debated, with Israel and   trading blame for the horrific incident.
Alfarra said of the EU's position : "The silence has shocked me. It's silence also in the US. It's disturbing."
"When the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza was bombed on Tuesday night, leaders of the EU had gathered for their virtual summit where they were discussing their stance on the Israel-Hamas war. I expected that the summit would suddenly stop with leaders condemning this atrocious war crime. But that summit did not even have a statement about the bombing. Not even a word," he said.
The virtual EU summit on Tuesday, began with the 27-member bloc's leaders holding a minute of silence for all the victims who lost their lives in Israel and Palestine, and for victims of   in France and Belgium.
When news of the hospital bombing broke, the leaders continued their meeting and reiterated "full solidarity with the people of Israel", saying "Israel has the right to defend itself – always in line with humanitarian and international law".
A few hours later, EU leaders such as the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrelland French President Emmanuel Macron condemned  the hospital attack.
EU Council President Charles Michel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and others expressed their solidarity with the victims of the hospital attack – a day later.

While the mood at the Palestinian Mission in Brussels is ever-sombre, Alfarra spends his time trying to raise awareness among EU officials about the difficulties Palestinian civilians are experiencing.
"I've met everybody here. Every policymaker in the Council, the Commission and the External Action Service. I told them, 'You've cried for Israel and stood up for the attacks against Israel. But now it's time for you to stand up stop the war crimes in Gaza.'"
With the envoys of Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and the mission of the League of Arab States in Europe, Alfarra has joined a coordinated push to talk to the EU with "one voice", to ensure leaders in the West understand the immensely precarious predicament of the Palestinian people.
"We have seen a systematic shift in the EU position especially after talking to the EU Council President Charles Michel's office. It was also us who protested the European Commission's decision to   last week. We're thankful they back-tracked that decision and increased humanitarian aid to Palestine by pledging 75 million euros [$79m]," he noted.
"But the EU can display its real power in supporting Gaza by pressuring Israel to allow this humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. They need to ensure all the border crossings open and not just Gaza's   with Egypt," Alfarra said.
Alfarra said he was also concerned by the ripple effects of the war on communities in the West, and accused Israel of waging an information war.
On October 14, Wadea Al-Fayoume, a six-year-old boy, was killed by a man – the family's landlord – because he was Muslim and a Palestinian-American, according to US police officials.
"We need to talk about how the Israeli propaganda machine on Palestine led to the murder of the   in the US," he said.
"My biggest fear right now is how countries in the West are falling for the Israeli propaganda machine and staying silent on the war crimes in Gaza. They are also remaining silent on Gaza because they depend on Israel for information about the region. This is dangerous."
"The more the international silence, the more the likelihood of the complete erasure of the civilian population in Gaza. So leaders need to condemn the attacks on Palestinian people and stop this war."

At least 2,808 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip in a blistering air assault launched by Israel last week after Hamas carried out a bloody attack on Israel that left more than 1,400 people dead.
Israel has attacked Gaza for an 11th day in a row as the besieged Palestinian enclave faces a growing humanitarian catastrophe.
At least 57 people have also been killed in the occupied West Bank area.
An Israeli army spokesperson has renewed orders for Palestinians in northern Gaza - where some 1.1 million people live - to flee south, raising fears that an Israeli ground operation could be imminent.
Israel says as many as 300,000 Israeli troops are massed near Gaza and are readying for war with Hamas.

Israel says no Jerusalem base for Saudi envoy to Palestinian Authority

Israel has rejected the idea of a diplomatic base in Jerusalem for Saudi Arabia's envoy to the Palestinian Authority (PA), who recently presented his credentials to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's diplomatic adviser Majdi al-Khalidi.
Ambassador Nayef al-Sudairi, the kingdom's current ambassador to Jordan, was named as non-resident envoy to Palestine and consul general in Jerusalem on Saturday at the Palestinian embassy in Amman.
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told Tel Aviv radio station 103 FM on Sunday that the new ambassador, Nayef al-Sudairi, could meet representatives of the PA but would have no fixed presence.
'Will there be an official physically sitting in Jerusalem? This we will not allow,' Cohen said.
Normalisation in the background?
The file for the Palestinian territory has traditionally been handled by Saudi Arabia's embassy in Amman.
The Saudi move appeared to be in line with the longstanding and so-far fruitless Palestinian goal of founding a state in territories occupied by Israel in a 1967 war, with East Jerusalem as the capital.
Israel deems Jerusalem its own capital, a status recognised by the United States under then-President Donald Trump in 2017 but not by other world powers. Israeli authorities bar Palestinian diplomatic activity in the city.
Saudi Arabia, Islam's birthplace, has championed the Palestinian cause and shunned official ties with Israel, but Washington is seeking to promote what could be a historic Middle East deal that would normalise Israeli-Saudi relations.
Israel's hard-right government has played down any prospect of it giving significant ground to the Palestinians as part of a normalisation deal with Saudi Arabia.
Like most of the Arab League, Riyadh has previously conditioned recognition of Israel on the Palestinian statehood goal being addressed. Among the challenges to that goal is the schism between the internationally recognised PA and its rival Hamas.
Bassam al-Agha, the Palestinian ambassador to Riyadh, cast al-Sudairi's appointment as Saudi affirmation of Palestinian statehood and 'rejection of what had been announced by former US President Trump'.
'This means a continuation of Saudi Arabia's positions,' al-Agha told Voice of Palestine radio.
While Cohen said al-Sudairi's appointment had not been coordinated with Israel, he saw a possible link to the normalisation prospects.
"What is behind this development is that, against the backdrop of progress in the US talks with Saudi Arabia and Israel, the Saudis want to relay a message to the Palestinians that they have not forgotten them,' Cohen said.

Mural of killed journalist Shireen Abu Akleh inaugurated in Bethlehem

A mural in memory of Al Jazeera's slain journalist,  , has been inaugurated in the Palestinian city of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank.
The municipality of Bethlehem unveiled the mural on Wednesday, saying that it was a tribute to Abu Akleh and her reporting on the Palestinian cause.
The ceremony took place on al-Mahd Street in Bethlehem in the presence of Abu Akleh's relatives and colleagues, as well as local officials.
Speakers at the event stressed the need for justice for Abu Akleh, who was killed by an Israeli soldier on May 11, 2022, while she was reporting from Jenin. No one has been held accountable for her killing.
Walid al-Omari, the head of Al Jazeera's bureau in Ramallah, said the mural conveyed a moral message.
"We're thankful to the Bethlehem municipality for this work, and we'll continue to follow up on Shireen's case so that we can achieve justice," al-Omari said.

Abu Akleh's brother, Tony, echoed that message.
"This mural is in memory of Shireen, especially in the city of Bethlehem, from where her origins come," said Tony. He went on to explain the close relationship between Shireen Abu Akleh and the "city of Christ", as he described it.
"This mural is not only for Shireen, but rather in memory of every martyr who was killed at the hands of the Israeli occupation," Tony said.
For his part, Hanna Hanania, Bethlehem's mayor, said that Abu Akleh represented the city, as well as Jerusalem, where she was born and eventually laid to rest, and the Palestinian people as a whole because she is "a martyr of the truth" who conveyed the Palestinian cause to the world.
"It's our duty to immortalise her name in 'the city of peace', Bethlehem," Hanania said.

Nida Ibrahim, Al Jazeera's correspondent in the occupied West Bank, expressed her sadness when she first saw the mural. "For me, it was a bittersweet moment," she said.
"It's a reminder of the loss we endured after she was killed, both as her colleagues and as Palestinian journalists," Ibrahim said. "A reminder that justice has not been served and that the killer is probably on the beach right now or enjoying coffee or living their life."
"It's really touching to see Shireen's pictures and memorials in different places in Palestine and abroad," Ibrahim added. "It shows the deep impact she has on people, as someone who was passionate and deeply interested in the human part of the story."

"It's been almost 500 days – but she's still with us and her memory lives on and on."
The killing of the late Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American dual nation, garnered international attention, and at first, Israel attempted to falsely accuse Palestinian fighters of fatally shooting the veteran reporter, who had been at Al Jazeera since 1997, and was renowned across the Arab world.
Months after the killing, Israel acknowledged that   but dismissed the incident as unintentional. The Israeli government has not opened a criminal probe into the killing – but Al Jazeera has  .
Numerous media outlets, rights groups and witnesses have documented that there was no fighting in the immediate vicinity of where Abu Akleh was shot.

Could a warning by the ICC chief prosecutor deter war crimes in Gaza?

Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan of the International Criminal Court (ICC) must send a message that he is monitoring developments and must warn against carrying out potential war crimes as heavy bombardment of Gaza continues, human rights groups and legal experts say.
Khan broke his silence last week on the Israel-Gaza war, which began with an October 7 attack by the armed wing of the Palestinian group   on Israel, in an interview with Reuters, saying the ICC has jurisdiction  over possible war crimes carried out in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel.
However, analysts and rights groups said Khan should have explicitly warned Hamas and Israel against committing crimes by making it clear that they would be subject to investigation.
They added that Khan's voice may have the power to deter some war crimes and to send a message to both Palestinian and Israeli victims of this conflict that they will not be abandoned by the court.
"What I did not hear, and what I would have liked to hear, is a stronger statement [from Khan] that the office of the prosecutor is collecting evidence and is monitoring the situation," said Adil Haque, a law professor at Rutgers University in the United States.
Khan's office has already been   in the occupied Palestinian territory since 2021 – mainly from the Israeli war on Gaza in 2014. However, no formal statement about the ongoing war has been issued despite the office doing so in conflicts such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the atrocities carried out this year in Sudan's western province Darfur.
Since October 7, at least   and at least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed.
Accusations of wrongdoing on both sides
Human Rights Watch (HRW) verified  four videos from the Hamas attack where fighters killed people who appeared to be civilians and said these incidents 'should be investigated as war crimes' while Amnesty International examined  video evidence that also shows deliberate 'shooting at civilians and taking civilians as hostages'.
Israel has responded to Hamas's surprise attack by cutting off the supply of food, water, fuel and electricity into Gaza, which "will undoubtfully cost civilian lives and constitutes collective punishment", according  to the United Nations.
Israel has also launched relentless air attacks on the Gaza Strip,   and destroying neighbourhoods. An HRW report  also found that Israel has used white phosphorus, an incendiary weapon that can burn flesh down to the bone and set fire to all nearby structures. Its use magnifies the dangers for civilians in Gaza - one of the most densely populated regions in the world, said the report.
On October 17, an   in Gaza City – where thousands of Palestinians were seeking medical care and shelter from the ongoing bombardment – killing at least 500 people, according to Gaza's health ministry.
While Israel denies responsibility for the hospital attack, its actions in Gaza may already amount to war crimes under international humanitarian law, legal experts told Al Jazeera.
Balkees Jarrah, the associate director for HRW's International Justice Program, said a public statement is critical: 'It is important [Khan] signals his willingness to expand his investigation into new crimes that are being committed right now.'

Statements a deterrent
In the past, former ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda issued warnings that deterred Israel from committing war crimes, said Ahmed Abofoul, a legal researcher and advocacy officer at Al-Haq , a Palestinian human rights organisation based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
In 2018, Bensouda warned Israel not to forcefully evict a Palestinian community from  , a village in the occupied West Bank sandwiched between illegal Israeli settlements, saying such action could constitute a  .
In a statement, Bensouda said that she would continue to keep 'a close eye on the developments on the ground and will not hesitate to take any appropriate action'.
Israeli officials delayed the eviction out of fear that it could invite an  .
'This [example] unequivocally shows that such preventative statements [from the ICC chief prosecutor] can provide sufficient deterrence [to war crimes],' Abofoul told Al Jazeera.
When asked last week by the BBC if Israel's ongoing aerial offensive on Gaza was excessive and violated the boundaries of international humanitarian law, Khan responded that he could not make an assessment about fighting that was just 'a few days old'.
But Haque told Al Jazeera that there is more than enough evidence to start an investigation against the Israeli army for its actions in Gaza.
'There are strong indications that the Israeli army has intentionally directed attacks against civilians, including medics, and civilian objects such as entire apartment buildings, and the war crime of launching attacks knowing that they will cause excessive or disproportionate harm to civilians,' he said.
'Depending on the duration of the Israeli siege [on Gaza], and the effects on civilians, the war crime of starvation may be implicated as well,' Haque added.

Palestinian victims need to know 'justice will be provided'
Khan was quite vocal after Russia attacked Ukraine on February 24, 2022.
Four days after the invasion, he announced that his office would   committed on Ukrainian territory.
Abofoul, whose family is among the two million people trapped in Gaza, said Palestinians want the ICC to express an equal commitment to probing war crimes that Israel may be committing.
"Palestinian victims in Gaza need to know that these crimes [against them] won't go unnoticed and that justice will be provided to them. They need to feel seen by the court, or they will feel abandoned," he said, speaking from his home in the Netherlands.
Mark Kersten, an assistant professor in criminology and criminal justice at the University of the Fraser Valley in Canada, agreed.
'I think, for many people who have experienced atrocities in Israel-Palestine or elsewhere, it's really powerful when a court reminds the world that it is on their side,' he said. 'I think that is an extremely powerful symbolic gesture.'

Foreign interests
However, political pressure could compromise any impartial investigation, even if Khan does launch a probe, analysts said.
Khan's approach to investigations in Afghanistan - where his office decided to ' deprioritise ' crimes committed by US personnel to focus on the Taliban's abuses - established a worrying precedent, the analysts pointed out.
Khan's decision followed years of US pressure against the court to drop a probe against its soldiers. Former US President Donald Trump   and other ICC officials in 2020.
Powerful Western countries that finance a number of the ICC's proceedings could use that influence to pressure the court into not investigating Israel, said Srinivas Burra, an assistant professor in legal studies at South Asian University in New Delhi, India.
'[Western] political considerations may play a role in the ICC's whole process, which was evident in the context of Afghanistan,' he said.
Further complications may arise from Israel's legal relationship with the ICC.
Because Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute - the treaty that established the ICC in 2002 - Burra suggested it had no legal obligation to cooperate with its proceedings.
'It will be difficult to say conclusively that there will be fair cooperation [with the court] from Israel's side,' he told Al Jazeera.
'The least the court could do'
Going forward, Khan's words and actions on Israel and Palestine have the power to restore - or damage - the court's credibility worldwide, according to some observers.
'It's ultimately up to ICC officials to guard their own independence,' said Jarrah of HRW. 'But ICC member countries can and should help to create the space for that independence by being firm and consistent in their support for impartial justice across the court's docket.'
Haque believes Khan has leverage.
According to the Rutgers professor, Western states have specifically designated funds to facilitate an ICC probe of Russia's crimes in Ukraine. He suggested that Khan could 'simply reverse' this arrangement and insist that any funding goes to supporting the court as a whole, not particular investigations.
'That would create a dilemma for the West because if states withdraw funding to investigate Israel, then they would also be withdrawing money to investigate Russia,' Haque told Al Jazeera.
During Khan's interview with Reuters, he called for more funding for the court as a whole, including for the ongoing investigation in the occupied Palestinian territory.
'Palestine - like every other situation that we have - is underfunded and under-resourced and it is a challenge to state parties and the international community whether they wish to give us the tools to do the job,' Khan told Reuters.
Khan's press office declined to speak to Al Jazeera and would not comment on whether a probe would be launched into any possible war crimes committed during the current conflict.
For now, Palestinians like Abofoul want the court to acknowledge the abuses in Gaza, where more than 1,000 children have been killed by Israel's offensive since October 7, and try to mitigate the extent of war crimes by telling the warring parties they are being monitored.
"How can Palestinians trust and expect justice from a court that doesn't try to prevent perpetrators by words?' Abofoul asked.
'That's the least the court could do.'

Israel vows 'unrelenting' attacks as dozens reported killed in Gaza strikes

October 24th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel has promised "unrelenting' attacks to eliminate Hamas, as Palestinian authorities reported dozens of people killed in the latest air strikes on Gaza.
At least 28 people were killed overnight in strikes on several homes in a district near Rafah, southern Gaza, Palestinian officials and medical sources told Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum in Gaza.
At least 14 others were also killed after an explosion at a fuel station following an Israeli strike in Khan Younis in the south of the enclave, Palestinian authorities told Abu Azzoum.
There were conflicting reports about the death toll, with Palestinian media reporting that more than 50 people had been killed in the strikes.
Dozens of people were also killed or wounded in Israeli strikes on the al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza, Gaza's Health Ministry said.
Israel's military said it had targeted a Hamas staging ground in the refugee camp, without providing further details.
Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the latest casualty figures.
The latest strikes come after Gaza's Health Ministry said on Monday that Israel's bombardment of the enclave had killed more than 430 people during the previous 24 hours, taking the total death toll in the enclave to more than 5,000 people.
Israel has bombarded Gaza and imposed a near-total blockade for more than two weeks as it seeks to eliminate Hamas in response to the armed group's October 7 attacks inside the country, which Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
Israeli Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi on Tuesday signalled that Israel would not let up on its bombardment ahead of an expected ground invasion of the densely populated enclave.
'We want to bring Hamas to a state of full dismantling – its leaders, its military branch, and its working mechanisms. That is why we are striking, and eliminating high-ranking commanders and members, destroying infrastructure, and acting with great determination,' Halevi said in a statement.
'The path is a path of unrelenting attacks, damaging Hamas everywhere and in every way. We are well prepared for the ground operations in the south.'
Israeli forces also launched a new round of night raids in the occupied West Bank overnight, with heavily armed troops backed by armoured vehicles seen in at least two areas of the Palestinian territory.
Israel's escalating attacks come as the country faces growing calls for restraint amid warnings of a humanitarian catastrophe in the besieged enclave.
In a rare intervention on Monday, former United States President Barack Obama said that Israel's actions in Gaza could erode global trust in the country and 'harden Palestinian attitudes for generations' to come.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Monday said he supported a pause in the   and warned that the limited supply of aid entering the enclave was 'not enough', echoing earlier calls for a ceasefire by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
China, which has stepped up its diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, on Monday said it would do "whatever is conducive' to secure a ceasefire and restore peace.
UN officials have warned that 2.3 million residents in the enclave are on the brink of starvation and at risk of cholera and other serious diseases due to the collapse of water and sanitation services.
US President Joe Biden's administration has publicly rejected calls for a ceasefire at this time, arguing that Israel has a right to defend itself.
US officials, however, have pressed Israel to delay its expected ground invasion of Gaza in order to allow more shipments of aid and more time for the release of captives held by Hamas.
Hamas, which governs Gaza, on Monday released two captives, saying it had freed 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper for 'humanitarian reasons'.

UN chief says 'clear violations of international humanitarian law' in Gaza

United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has   for a ceasefire in Gaza and said that international law was being violated in the war between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas.
Israel has bombarded the besieged Gaza Strip relentlessly since October 7, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel, killling at least 1,400 people according to Israeli authorities.
After the attack, Israel cut off supplies of water, food, fuel and electricity to the enclave's 2.3 million residents, an act the UN has called a form of  . It also launched an assault on the territory, killing at least 5,791 people, according to authorities in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas.
More than one million people have been displaced, as Israel ordered residents of northern Gaza to evacuate to the south, but Israeli air raids   the territory.
Speaking before the 15-member UN Security Council on Tuesday, Guterres pleaded for civilians to be protected and warned that the fighting risked a wider   in the region.
"It is important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation," Guterres said.
"But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the   by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people," he said.
Guterres also criticised Israel without naming it, saying "protecting civilians does not mean ordering more than one million people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself."
The secretary-general's comments drew ire from Israel's UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan, who called the speech 'shocking'.
"His statement that 'the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum' expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder," Erdan posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. "It's truly sad that the head of an organisation that arose after the Holocaust holds such horrible views."
In his speech, Guterres called the attack by Hamas 'horrifying and unprecedented" and demanded the release of the roughly 200 people captured and   by Hamas.
Plea for emergency aid
Earlier, United Nations agencies called "on our knees" for emergency aid to be allowed unimpeded into Gaza, saying more than 20 times current deliveries were needed.
A small trickle of humanitarian aid has   since Saturday from the Egyptian side, but Guterres called such limited assistance 'a drop of aid in an ocean of need'.

Israeli security forces restricted young Palestinians from entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem for prayers on Friday and deployed in strength across the Old City and beyond to quell any unrest spilling over from the conflict in Gaza.
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops killed four Palestinians during raids, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA said. Two of the dead were identified by fighter groups as their members.
Large numbers of Israeli police kept guard around Al-Aqsa, a flashpoint and often the scene of clashes, as Palestinians gathered for Friday prayers, reports said. At one point, the police fired tear gas at the Palestinians, according to Reuters.
In  , the Israeli military said that during arrest operations, its troops came under attack in   and fired back, killing two men.
The Islamic Jihad group confirmed one of the men belonged to the group, and Hamas said one of its fighters was killed in the Jenin fighting.
WAFA said another two Palestinians were killed, one in Jenin and one in the town of Qalqilya, saying their deaths took the number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank since the   broke out to 110.
Earlier in the day, Israeli forces destroyed a memorial in Jenin for the slain   and razed the street where she was fatally shot by an Israeli soldier.
The military said that in Qalqilya, troops came under fire while shutting down a shop whose owner was accused of incitement of violence. They returned fire, hitting at least one person, a military statement said.

'350 people protesting and chanting for Gaza'
Protests in solidarity with the people of Gaza also took place in   in the West Bank. The protest began at the Ibn Rushd roundabout in the centre of town, with demonstrators denouncing Israeli actions and expressing support for Palestinian resistance.
One protester, who spoke to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, said the Israeli army suppressed the demonstration using drones.
'There were about 350 people there protesting and chanting for Gaza," the protester said. "The occupation forces first sent out a surveillance drone that took pictures of the people who were there. About half an hour later, a larger drone came around and dropped gas bombs on the people protesting,' the person added.
Political forces called for a strike and mourning tomorrow in the Hebron Governorate and its cities on Saturday.
In Nablus, video footage being circulated by the Jenin News outlet, and verified by Sanad, shows a group of demonstrators being dispersed by what is said to be Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces. Sanad is Al Jazeera's fact-checking and verification unit.
As the protesters ran from clouds of what looked like tear gas, they could be heard chanting "Spies! Spies!" in reference to the PA's forces.
In Ramallah, social media videos, corroborated by Sanad, showed a massive demonstration in solidarity with the residents of Gaza, predominantly led by young men. This protest followed the Israeli army spokesman's   into the Gaza Strip.

In the capital of neighbouring Jordan, thousands of people took to the streets to denounce Israel and voice support for the Palestinians. Many waved the green, red, white and black Palestinian flag.
"We are with Palestinians and with Gazans. We also came to stress that we are standing behind the resistance until the end," said participant Mahmoud Aqalan.
Another protester, Hassan Sultan, said: "It is our brothers who are being killed in Gaza. This is the least we could do – to make our position known to the world."

Israel bombs al-Maghazi refugee camp, killing dozens, Gaza officials say

November 5th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel's military has bombed al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza, killing more than 30 people, Palestinian officials have said.
The victims of the air raid on Saturday were taken to al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah, the Ministry of Health in the Hamas-run enclave said in a statement.
Palestinian news agency Wafa earlier reported that the bombing killed 51 people, mostly women and children.
Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the number of casualties from the bombing, which comes days after air raids on the Jabalia and Bureij refugee camps that Palestinian officials say killed more than 200 people.
Israel's military did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment.
However, a military spokesperson told the AFP news agency it was investigating whether their forces had been operating in the area at the time.
The latest attacks came after the United States on Saturday rejected calls by Arab countries for an immediate ceasefire in the monthlong conflict.
At a news conference with his Jordanian and Egyptian counterparts in Amman, US Secretary of State Blinken said a full ceasefire would 'leave Hamas in place to regroup and repeat attacks'.
US President Joe Biden's administration has instead proposed localised 'humanitarian pauses' to facilitate the delivery of aid into Gaza and efforts to secure the release of captives held by Hamas.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected a temporary cessation in the war unless it involves the release of the more than 240 Israelis and foreigners believed to have been taken captive by the Palestinian armed group.
Blinken is on Sunday set to continue his tour of the Middle East – his second since the Israel-Hamas war began – with a two-day visit to Turkey.
At least 9,488 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its campaign to eliminate Hamas, according to Palestinian officials.
At least 1,430 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage during Hamas's surprise attack on southern Israel on October 7, according to Israeli officials.

Washington Post cartoon slammed as 'racist, vile', ignites controversy

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A cartoon in the Washington Post's opinion section has triggered controversy and sparked anger over its "racist" and "orientalist" depiction of Arabs and Palestinians.
Titled, Human Shields, it depicts a man in a dark, striped suit, which has Hamas in bold white letters emblazoned on it, for the Palestinian group.
The man's eyebrows are arched, his nose is comically large. He has four children strapped to his body, including a baby positioned on his head. A woman – veiled and docile – and meant to represent Palestinian women, cowers behind him.
The man is lifting a finger and the thought cloud above him reads: "How dare Israel attack civilians?" According to the cartoon, published on November 6, he is Hamas.
The title as well as the depiction of children and a woman tied to him, appear to reference allegations by Israel, which are often repeated by Western leaders and echoed by many mainstream media outlets, that Hamas uses human shields.
Next to the man, woman and children, who are flanked by a Palestinian flag, is a partial portrait of the Dome of the Rock in occupied East Jerusalem and beneath is an oil lamp.
The cartoon was published as more than 10,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, including 4,000 children, have been killed in Israeli military attacks since the war started on October 7.
Two days after publication, the outrage on social media, as well as the Washington Post's website was growing.
On X, formerly Twitter, a user called the image "beyond vile, bigoted and dehumanising".
Others said the dehumanisation was reminiscent of anti-Semitic cartoons that depicted Jews in a negative light.
"I can't get over how this looks exactly like a traditional antisemitic character, just with a few modified features", posted one user, while another wrote: "Notably this is exactly how they used to depict Jews in European newspapers in the 1930s."
On the Post's website, one reader commented: "Shame on Washington Post for using racist tropes that are currently being used to justify a genocide where majority killed are children. Dehumanizing any peoples paves a way for injustices to occur. Unfortunate to see The Washington Post fuel that racist fire. This cartoon and the fact that it was published is appalling."
The cartoon is reminiscent of those featured in the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo which were derogatory to the Prophet Muhammad.
Protests have erupted across the Arab and Muslim worlds over these images in past years.
The cartoonist, Michael Ramirez, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, has attacked Palestinians before. In another cartoon, he plays on the slogan "Black Lives Matter", to make it "Terrorist Lives Matter", implying that the support that Black people in the United States have shown for Palestinians is tantamount to siding with Hamas.

Thousands of people have rallied in countries across the Middle East and North Africa to protest against a   in the Gaza Strip that killed nearly 500 people, according to Palestinian officials in the besieged enclave.
Following calls for a 'day of rage', people in Lebanon, Jordan, Yemen, Tunisia and the occupied West Bank took to the streets on Wednesday to denounce the hit on al-Ahli Arab Hospital and express their solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

Hamas, the group running the besieged Gaza Strip, has blamed Israel for the strike on the hospital. Israel has denied responsibility, claiming that a misdirected rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad was responsible. The group has rejected Israel's accusation.
On Wednesday, thousands of people gathered outside the US and Israeli embassies in Amman, the capital of Jordan. Islamic parties in the country called for a general strike while the Jordanian government declared three days of mourning.
In the Lebanese capital, Beirut, protesters clashed with security forces who used water cannons to disperse crowds close to the US embassy.
In Tunis, demonstrators gathered at the French embassy in the Tunisian capital, shouting slogans such as 'The French and Americans are allies of Zionists'.

Meanwhile, in Ramallah, demonstrators again turned out in a show of solidarity with the people of Gaza enduring Israel's heaviest bombardment in the wake of an unprecedented attack by Hamas inside Israel on October 7.
The protest came after people took to the streets on Tuesday night and were confronted by Palestinian security forces.
Overnight, demonstrations also took place in Turkey, Morocco, Libya and Iran.

United States President Joe Biden has called for 'accelerating' humanitarian assistance to Gaza in phone calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the White House said.
Biden spoke with the two leaders separately on Sunday and they discussed different aspects of the conflict in Palestine as Israel continues to pound Gaza, according to the White House.
To Netanyahu, Biden said Israel has 'every right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism' but he added that this needs to happen 'in a manner consistent with   that prioritises protection of civilians'.
Biden also 'underscored the need to immediately and significantly increase the flow of humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of civilians in Gaza', the White House said.
More than 8,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed by Israeli air attacks since it began hitting the besieged enclave after a surprise attack by Hamas on October 7 killed about 1,400 Israelis.
Gaza earlier this week experienced a near-total communication blackout but some internet and mobile connection has since been restored. The enclave is also running dangerously low on fuel, food, water and medicine.
Israel has also  , which have gradually intensified in the past few days. Fighting is ongoing on the ground with Palestinian armed groups including Hamas.
On Sunday, the Israeli military also said that its call two weeks ago for Palestinians to evacuate northern Gaza – which the United Nations and rights groups have heavily criticised – is now 'urgent'.
According to the White House, Biden and Netanyahu on Sunday also discussed efforts to secure the release of captives taken by Hamas and other groups.
Israel said on Sunday it has confirmed 239 captives are being held in Gaza.
During the call with the Egyptian president, Biden and el-Sisi 'committed to the significant acceleration and increase of assistance flowing into Gaza beginning today and then continuously', the White House said.
Humanitarian aid has trickled into Gaza through the Rafah crossing run by Egypt, the only crossing not controlled by Israel. However, the UN and others have said the current amount of aid is   in answering the needs of the 2.3 million Palestinians in the enclave.
As Egypt remains concerned about the fate of Palestinians who may wish to flee Gaza, the White House said that 'ensuring that Palestinians in Gaza are not displaced to Egypt or any other nation' was also on the agenda.
Sisi, whose Egypt is already home to millions of refugees including Palestinians, has repeatedly said that Palestinians should not move away from their ancestral lands in order for them to be able to achieve a longstanding dream of nationhood.

Turkey's Erdogan calls Israeli siege and bombing of Gaza a 'massacre'

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has condemned Israel's blockade and bombing of the  , calling it a 'massacre'.
Speaking to the members of his ruling AK Party in parliament on Wednesday, Erdogan said even war had a "morality" but the flare-up since the weekend had "very severely" violated that.
"Preventing people meeting their most fundamental needs and bombing housing where civilians live – in short, conducting a conflict using every sort of shameful method – is not a war, it's a massacre," he said, referring to Israel cutting off electricity and water to Gaza and destroying infrastructure.
"We openly oppose the killing of civilians on Israeli territories. Likewise, we can never accept the massacre of defenceless innocents in Gaza by indiscriminate, constant bombardments," Erdogan said.
At least 1,055 Palestinians have been killed and thousands wounded in   since Saturday, when the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched an unprecedented raid inside Israel. At least 1,200 Israelis have also been killed and more than 100 taken hostage in the ongoing conflict.
Israel has put Gaza under "total siege" to stop food and fuel from reaching the enclave of 2.3 million people, many poor and dependent on aid. The Gaza administration on Wednesday said electricity went out after the only power station stopped working.
Erdogan said Israel's repressive policies towards the Palestinians lay at the  . 'Israel should not forget that if it acts like an organisation, not as a state, it will eventually come to be seen like one,' he said.
(Al Jazeera)
Erdogan criticised Israel's "disproportionate" attacks on Gaza as "devoid of any ethical foundation", and called on the world not to "blindly" take one side. Leaving the underlying issue unresolved would lead to new, more violent conflicts, he warned.
"We call on countries in the Americas, Europe, and other regions to take up a position between the parties that is fair, just, and based on humanitarian balances. Everyone should refrain from acts that will wholly punish the Palestinian people, like blocking humanitarian aid," he said.
Turkey, which has backed Palestinians in the past and hosted members of Hamas, has been working to   with Israel after years of animosity. Unlike the European Union and the United States, Turkey does not consider Hamas a "terrorist" organisation.
Ankara has offered to mediate in the ongoing conflict, with Erdogan and his foreign minister holding calls with regional powers, the US and others. However, Israel's envoy to Ankara said it was too early to discuss mediation.

Q&A: Former UN official Craig Mokhiber on Gaza and genocide
Newstex Blogs

November 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Craig Mokhiber, a top United Nations human rights official who stepped down at the weekend over the organisation's response to the war in Gaza, has called on the UN to attach the same standards to Israel as it does when assessing human rights violations in other countries around the world.
Mokhiber, who was the director of the New York office of the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, wrote in his October 28 resignation letter that   were 'textbook genocide', and accused the UN of again "failing" to act, referring to previous genocides in Bosnia, Rwanda, and  .
Mokhiber, an international human rights lawyer, had been with the UN since 1992 and worked previously as a human rights adviser in Afghanistan and the occupied Palestinian territories.
At least 8,805 Palestinians have been   in Gaza since October 7 after the armed group Hamas launched a surprise assault on Israel, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 200 people captive.
'The current wholesale slaughter of the Palestinian people, rooted in an ethno-nationalist colonial-settler ideology, in continuation of decades of their systematic persecution and purging, based entirely upon their status as Arabs … leaves no room for doubt,' Mokhiber said in his letter to the UN human rights chief, Volker Turk.
Al Jazeera's correspondent at the UN, Gabriel Elizondo, sat down with Mokhiber in New York.
He asked him about his assessment of the situation in Gaza and the chances of a two-state solution.
The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Al Jazeera: Why did you come to conclusion that the situation in Gaza amounts to a genocide?
Craig Mohkiber: Usually the most difficult part of proving genocide is intent because there has to be an intention to destroy in whole, or in part, a particular group. In this case, the intent by Israeli leaders has been so explicitly stated and publicly stated – by the prime minister, by the president, by senior cabinet ministers, by military leaders – that that is an easy case to make. It's on the public record.
It's important that we start using the language that the law sets out, just as you know, in recent times, every major international human rights organisation, Israeli human rights organisations, Palestinian human rights organisations, United Nations human rights mechanisms, independent mechanisms have found that the situation in Israel Palestine amounts to the crime of apartheid.
The UN needs to get used to addressing these particular violations, just as we have in other situations.
Al Jazeera: When we asked the secretary-general and his office about genocide, he won't use that term. He says a previous secretary-general said that that is for courts to decide. Do you think that the secretary-general should start using the term 'genocide' when it comes to what we're seeing in Gaza?
Mokhiber: If we can allege that we see war crimes, crimes against humanity, as we have often done, there's no reason to exclude, where we see very strong evidence, the possibility of genocide being committed, and I think you're going to be hearing that term more and more in connection with what we're witnessing in Gaza.
But institutions, of course, have to go through the necessary steps before they can make that pronouncement. As of today, I am an independent citizen, not carrying the institution on my shoulders. And I feel quite confident as a human rights lawyer in saying that what I see unfolding in Gaza and beyond is genocide.
Al Jazeera: [US President] Joe Biden has recently said that after this conflict is over, we need to get back to a two-state solution. In your letter, you say the mantra of a two-state solution has become, and I quote, an open joke in the corridors of the United Nations where we are sitting right now. Is it really an open joke in the corridors of the United Nations?
Mokhiber: Yes, and it has been for quite a long time, if you ask somebody in their official capacity about the two states, and they will repeat that phrase over and over again as the official position of the United Nations. Indeed, that is the official position of the United States. But nobody who follows these circumstances either from the political side or from the human rights side believes that a two-state solution is possible anymore.
There's nothing left for a Palestinian state that would be sustainable or just or were possible in any respect, and everyone knows that.
And secondly, that solution never dealt with the problem of the fundamental human rights of Palestinians. So for example, it would leave them as second-class citizens without full human rights inside what is now Israel proper.
And so when people are not talking from official talking points, you hear increasingly about a one-state solution.
And what that means is beginning to advocate for the principle of equality of human rights instead of these old political taglines, that would mean a state in which we'll have equal rights for Christians, Muslims and Jews, based upon human rights and based upon the rule of law. It is what we call for in every other circumstance around the world. And the question is, why is the United Nations not going for that in Israel and Palestine?

Israel, Hezbollah exchange fire raising regional tensions

Israel has exchanged fire with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, raising the prospect of a broader regional conflict on Sunday, a day after an unprecedented   on southern Israel by Hamas that killed at least 250 Israelis.
More than 300 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli bombardments of the besieged Gaza enclave in the wake of the large-scale Hamas attack that took Israel by surprise. The Palestinian enclave has effectively been under an Israeli land, sea and air blockade since 2007.
Hamas and other Palestinian factions have been calling for the blockade to end and have organised protests at the fence that separates the territory from Israel.
Hezbollah, a powerful armed group backed by Iran, said it had launched guided rockets and artillery onto three posts in Shebaa Farms "in solidarity" with the Palestinian people. Shebaa Farms, which is claimed by Lebanon, was captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.
'On the path to liberate the remaining part of our occupied Lebanese land and in solidarity with the victorious Palestinian resistance and the steadfast Palestinian people, the groups of the martyr commander Hajj Imad Moghniyeh in the Islamic Resistance carried out an attack this Sunday, October 08, 2023, targeting 3 Zionist occupation sites in the occupied Lebanese Shebaa Farms region,' Hezbollah said in a statement.
The Israeli military said on Sunday it fired artillery into an area of Lebanon from where cross-border mortar fire was launched. Israel's military said one of its drones struck a Hezbollah post in the area of Har Dov, an area in Shebaa Farms.
Israel said its forces 'are now attacking with artillery fire the area in Lebanon from where shooting was carried out a few minutes ago into Israeli territory'. The Israeli forces said they were 'prepared for all scenarios, and will continue to protect the security of the residents of the State of Israel'.
Tel Aviv has held the Shebaa Farms, a 39-square-km (15-square-mile) patch of land, since 1967. Both Syria and Lebanon claim the Shebaa Farms are Lebanese.
There was no comment from the Lebanese authorities on the incident.
The United Nations peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency.
On Saturday, it said it had enhanced its presence in southern Lebanon following developments in Israel and Gaza.
Hezbollah, which effectively controls southern Lebanon, said on Saturday it was in "direct contact" with leaders of Palestinian "resistance" groups. The group said it saw Palestinian attacks on Israel as a "decisive response to Israel's continued occupation and a message to those seeking normalisation with Israel".

Here is the   on Wednesday, October 18, 2023:
Fighting
At least   have been killed in an Israeli air attack on the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in the besieged Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has condemned the targeting of the hospital in Gaza as a 'hideous war massacre' that cannot be tolerated.
"The entire world should know: it was barbaric terrorists in Gaza that attacked the hospital in Gaza, and not the IDF," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, referring to the Israeli army.
Daoud Shehab, a spokesman for Islamic Jihad, told Reuters: "This is a lie and fabrication, it is completely incorrect. The occupation is trying to cover for the horrifying crime and massacre they committed against civilians."
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has just now called for an 'immediate' ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas.
He also said that attacks by Hamas did not justify the  ' of the Palestinian people.
At least 37 more people have been killed in separate air raids targeting two neighbourhoods at a refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to officials.
The Israeli army has identified two more soldiers who died since the war started on October 7.
Diplomacy and protests
Jordan cancelled a summit it was to host in Amman on Wednesday with US President Joe Biden and the Egyptian and Palestinian leaders to discuss  , Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said.
"I am outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted,"  , said in a statement.
"The United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients, medical staff and other innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy."
The hospital blast drew condemnation across the Arab world, and protests were staged at Israel's embassies in Turkey and Jordan and near the US embassy in Lebanon, where security forces fired tear gas towards demonstrators.
Palestinian security forcesin Ramallah fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse protesters throwing rocks and chanting against President Mahmoud Abbas as popular anger boiled over after the deadly Gaza hospital attack.
Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group denounced what it said was Israel's deadly attack on the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, which is run by the Anglican Church, and called for "a day of unprecedented anger" against Israel and Biden's visit.
The United Nations Security Council will now vote on Wednesday on a Brazilian-drafted resolution that calls for humanitarian pauses in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas to allow humanitarian aid access to the Gaza Strip.
The US State Department will continue to offer government-sponsored charter flights to Europe from Tel Aviv to help Americans leave Israel through at least Sunday.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited a marked rise in anti-Semitism in Canada after Hamas attacked Israel and Israel's subsequent deadly air strikes in Gaza.

Palestinian state 'most reliable' solution to conflict with Israel: Russia

October 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said that creating a Palestinian state was the "most reliable" solution for peace in Israel and that fighting alone would not ensure security.
Lavrov spoke on Monday during a news conference with the head of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, who visited Russia after Hamas, the Palestinian group that rules Gaza, launched   on Saturday.
Creating a "Palestinian state that would live side by side with Israel … is the most reliable path to solve [the conflict]", Lavrov said.
"We cannot agree with those who say that security can only be ensured through a fight with terrorism."
He said Moscow was "deeply concerned that hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians have died and that the Gaza Sector has been declared a target for Israeli retaliation".
Lavrov said Russia – in the middle of its almost 20-month-long Ukraine offensive – had "serious questions" about Western policy on Israel.
"They say that [fighting] should be stopped immediately, that Israel should destroy the terrorists," Lavrov said.
"But this was done before … and never after the situation calmed down did they come to the fact that the main reason [for the conflict] needs to be eliminated," he said.
"The Palestinian problem should not be delayed further."

Lavrov earlier said that Russia and the Arab League would work to "stop the bloodshed" in Israel and Gaza.
Aboul Gheit, meanwhile, said he condemned "the violence, but from all sides".
"We demand the creation of political prospects and a fair resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict," he said.
The Kremlin said on Monday it feared a foreign player could enter the conflict after the US moved warships closer to its ally Israel.
"The risk of third forces becoming involved in this conflict is high," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by the TASS news agency.
"It is very important to find ways as soon as possible to move towards some kind of negotiation process in order to reduce this escalation and move away from a military solution," he said.

US President Biden says 'chances are real' for extending Israel-Gaza truce

United States President Joe Biden has said there is a 'real' chance that a four-day pause in Israel's war on Gaza could be extended.
'I think the chances are real,' he told reporters on Friday, while also refusing to speculate on how long the war that started on October 7 after a surprise Hamas attack inside Israel could last.
'My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can,' Biden said, while reiterating his support for Israel.
He stressed that 'eliminating' Hamas remains a 'legitimate' mission for Israel.
He only said he has 'encouraged' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  .
About 15,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed so far in Israeli bombardments following the Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel.
Under the terms of the truce, which came into effect early on Friday, 50 women and children held in Gaza are to be released over four days, in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children who are among thousands imprisoned in Israeli jails.
On Friday, 39 Palestinians were released in the occupied West Bank in exchange for Hamas releasing 24 captives , including 13 Israelis. More are expected to be released on Saturday afternoon.
After the release of the first Hamas-held captives, Biden said: "It's only a start, but so far it's gone well."
Both Israel and Hamas have promised that they will continue to fight, but Israel has signalled it is open to extending the truce if more captives are released at a rate of 10 per day – something Biden said he hoped would come to pass.
Hamas has said the non-civilian Israelis it is holding will only be exchanged for the thousands of Palestinians who are   in harsh conditions, many of them held without charge.
About 200 trucks with humanitarian aid also made their way into the besieged enclave as part of the truce on Friday, with the first deliveries into northern Gaza since the start of the war arriving on Saturday.
But the level of destruction remains high both in the north and in the south of the Gaza Strip, and the United Nations confirmed on Friday that Israel significantly ramped up its attacks in Gaza before the truce came into effect.

'Relief' in war-torn enclave as truce takes effect in Israel-Gaza war

A Qatar-mediated four-day truce has taken effect in Israel's war on Gaza. The first pause after seven weeks of bombardment has been met with relief by Palestinians.
During the humanitarian break in the fighting, which began at 7am (05:00 GMT) on Friday, 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and 50 captives held by the Hamas armed group in Gaza are due 
The first releases, which will see 39 Palestinians and 13 Israelis freed, are expected on Friday afternoon.
In the hours preceding the start of the truce, Israeli bombing intensified across the Gaza Strip, with attacks in Rafah and the city of Khan Younis in the south, as well as constant artillery shelling in the north of the enclave.
Almog Boker, a correspondent for the Israeli station Channel 13, has posted a video online showing Israeli soldiers celebrating from afar as a number of buildings were destroyed in the northern Gaza Strip in the last hour before the start of the truce.
בשעה האחרונה שלפני הפסקת האש, כוחות צהל השמידו תוואי מנהרות תת קרקעיות ומספר פירי מנהרות במרחב בית החולים שיפאא'. כך זה נראה ונשמע: pic.twitter.com/FHabuf2C6r
- almog boker (@bokeralmog) November 24, 2023
The first pause in the fighting was met with huge relief by Palestinians, who were rejoicing to be safe from Israeli bombardment for the first time in weeks, Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Khan Younis, southern Gaza.
"This is the first time that we have not heard Israeli drones since the beginning of this round of fighting," he said. "People sense that there is a glimmer of hope that this short-term pause will pave the way for a longer ceasefire."
Badly needed aid
Under the deal, brokered by Qatar, badly needed aid will be allowed into Gaza. The enclave has been under a total Israeli blockade since the war was triggered by Hamas's attack on October 7.
Egypt said 130,000 litres of diesel and four trucks of gas will be delivered daily to Gaza over the four days. Overall, 200 trucks carrying aid are set to enter Gaza daily.
Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed, reporting from the Rafah border crossing, said that two trucks carrying petrol and one transporting gas have already crossed into Gaza from Egypt.
"They are located in the parking for trucks inside Gaza and will soon be transferred to the stations," she said.
Additional aid would start flowing into Gaza and the first captives, including elderly women, would be freed at 4pm (14:00 GMT), said Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari in Doha. The total number of hostages to be freed by Hamas will rise to 50 over the four days.
Monitoring truce
Qatar will monitor the truce in real time for possible violations, reported Al Jazeera's James Bays from Doha.
"Qatar has an operations room here in Doha where they are going to get real-time information from Gaza. They have direct links with the Israeli military, with Hamas," he said.
"The idea is that if there is any sort of violation, that because of those direct links, they are going to try and nip it in the bud and make sure that this truce can continue, that this process can continue for the four days," he added.
Fighting raged on in the hours leading up to the truce, with officials inside the Hamas-ruled enclave saying a hospital in Gaza City was among the targets bombed.
Both sides also signalled the pause would be temporary before fighting resumes.
The Indonesian Hospital was reeling under relentless bombing, operating without light and filled with bedridden old people and children too weak to be moved, Gaza health officials said.
Munir al-Bursh, the Gaza health ministry director, told Al Jazeera that a wounded woman was killed and three others injured.
Israel launched its devastating invasion of Gaza after gunmen from Hamas burst across the border fence on October 7, killing 1,200 people and seizing about 240 captives, according to Israeli tallies.
Since then, Israel has rained bombs on the besieged enclave, killing more than 14,000 people in Gaza, about 40 percent of them children, according to Palestinian health authorities.
'I want to go home'
As soon as the fighting paused, thousands of displaced Palestinians have set out to check on their homes in central and southern areas of the enclave reports Al Jazeera's Wael Dahdouh from Khan Younis.
'One man said, 'I want to go home and even if it is destroyed, I want to stay there. I want to die there',' the correspondent reported.
'One woman with a child said, 'I pray that these days will get longer and longer, to just feel safe for a day or two'.'
However, the Israeli military said its forces will be stationed at the truce lines and will not allow Palestinians to head to northern Gaza.

Abbas tells UN peace only possible when Palestinians get full rights

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has told the United Nations General Assembly that Middle East peace will not be achievable until the Palestinians are granted full rights.
"Those who think that peace can prevail in the Middle East without the Palestinian people enjoying their full, legitimate national rights would be mistaken," Abbas told the UN's annual gathering on Thursday.
The veteran 87-year-old leader made a new appeal to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to call an international conference on creating a Palestinian state.
A UN conference "may be the last opportunity to salvage the two-state solution and to prevent the situation from deteriorating more seriously and threatening the security and stability of our region and the entire world", Abbas said.
Saudi-Israeli normalisation
Abbas's address came as the United States appeared to make progress in brokering a  .
The US, historically the peace broker between the two sides, has all but given up on serious negotiations with Israeli Prime Minister  's hard-right government, which has pushed forward with illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Israeli-Saudi normalisation would dramatically redraw the Middle East by formally bringing together two major US partners and longtime adversaries.
Netanyahu met US President Joe Biden on Wednesday on the sidelines of the annual General Assembly in New York, and on the same day, an interview was aired with Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in which he said that the process of normalisation was getting "closer".
The normalisation talks are the centrepiece of complex negotiations that also include discussions of US security guarantees and civilian nuclear help that Riyadh has sought, as well as possible Israeli concessions to the Palestinians.

Israel-Gaza war 'devastating' Palestine economy, UN warns

November 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The socioeconomic "shock" of the Israel-Gaza war will force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into poverty, a United Nations report  on the conflict's possible long-term effects on Gaza and the occupied West Bank warned.
As the war passed the one-month mark this week, poverty had increased by 20 percent and gross domestic product declined by 4.2 percent, according to the report released by the UN Development Programme and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA).
The level of economic impact outstrips that of the conflicts Syria and Ukraine, or any previous Israel-Palestine war, the agencies said.
At least 10,800 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and more than two-thirds of the 2.3 million population have fled their homes since Israel blockaded the enclave and unleashed a campaign of air strikes and a ground assault. At least 182 Palestinians have been killed and more than 2,250 injured as violence spreads across the West Bank.
Should the war persist for a second month, the UN projects that Palestinian GDP, which previously totalled $20.4bn annually, will drop by $1.7bn, or 8.4 percent.
The economy is likely to shrink by 12 percent, with losses of $2.5bn and more than 660,000 people pushed into poverty, if the conflict stretches into a third month, the report projects.
UN Development Programme Assistant Secretary-General Abdallah al-Dardari told a news conference that a 12 percent GDP loss at the end of the year would be "massive and unprecedented".
By comparison, he said, the Syrian economy used to lose 1 percent of its GDP per month at the height of its conflict, and it took a year and a half of fighting for Ukraine to lose 30 percent of its GDP, an average of about 1.6 percent a month.
At the beginning of 2023, the Palestinian territories - the West Bank and Gaza - were considered a lower middle-income economy with a poverty level of $6 per day per person, UN ESCWA Executive Secretary Rola Dashti said.
In January, Gaza was already grappling with high unemployment of about 46 percent, three and a half times higher than the West Bank's 13 percent, the report said. Four weeks of war have destroyed some 390,000 jobs.
"As the war hits the one-month mark, 61 percent of employment in Gaza, equivalent to 182,000 jobs, is estimated to have been lost," it said.
'Unimaginable' destruction
About 24 percent of employment in the West Bank has also been lost, equivalent to 208,000 jobs, according to the report.
Al-Dardari pointed to massive economic disruption in the occupied territory's agriculture and tourism sectors. In addition, he said, there are major disruptions to trade, to the transfer of money from Israel to the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, and a lack of investment.
Dashti, from the ESCWA, called the level of destruction in Gaza "unimaginable and unprecedented".
"As of November 3, it is estimated that 35,000 housing units have been totally demolished and about 220,000 units are partially damaged," she said. The report said at least 45 percent of Gaza's housing units have been destroyed or damaged.
If this persists, the majority of Gaza residents will have no homes, and even if the fighting ended now there will be massive long-term displacement, "with all its humanitarian economic development and security consequences," al-Dardari said.
Satellite images show that in the governorates of north Gaza and Gaza City, more than 36 percent of greenhouses were destroyed or damaged, and more than 1,000 fields have been damaged, the report says.
"We have to recognise that the consequence of what is happening right now is literally a development crisis for years to come," UNDP administrator Achim Steiner told AFP news agency.
"In our most conservative scenario, this conflict is likely to set back development (in the Palestinian territories) by well over a decade," he added.
In the most pessimistic outlook, the human development index – which measures life expectancy, education and standard of living – could roll back to 2007 levels, the UN assessment said.

Israeli forces raided the Askar refugee camp in the occupied West Bank city of Nablus and demolished the home of a Palestinian man who was allegedly involved in killing two Israeli settlers last February.
According to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, Israeli forces surrounded the third-floor home of Abdelfattah Kharousheh overnight on Tuesday and blew it up six hours after the raid.
The army had accused Kharousheh of   Halel Menachem Yaniv and his brother Yagel Yaakov Yaniv, in February as they drove through the occupied West Bank town of Huwara.

Before the demolition, Israeli soldiers forced at least 60 Palestinians – including 20 children – who lived next to the home of the Kharousheh family to leave their houses and briefly detained them inside a local mosque, according to Wafa.

The latest raid sparked heavy confrontations between the Israeli army and the camp's residents. The Palestinian Red Crescent said they dealt with 185 cases of tear gas suffocation, and that six Palestinians were wounded, including one by live ammunition.
In a statement, the Israeli military said several "violent riots were instigated which included rock hurling and tyre burning".
"In addition, explosive devices were hurled, and live fire was shot at the forces, who responded with riot dispersal means."
A few weeks earlier, Israeli forces took measurements of Kharousheh's imprisoned son's house in preparation for its demolition, on charges of helping his father in the operation.
Speaking to local media, Kharousheh's wife said the demolition of the family home "will not break our resolve".
"We are steadfast here despite all that the [Israeli] occupation does," she said.
Askar refugee camp is one of the most overcrowded camps in the West Bank, with at least 30,000 Palestinians living on 0.12sq km (0.05sq miles).
Israel regularly demolishes the homes of Palestinians it accuses of deadly attacks on Israelis, arguing that such measures act as a deterrent.
Human rights activists say the policy amounts to collective punishment, as it can render non-fighters, including children, homeless.
In a statement on Tuesday, Hamas said the Israeli tactic of demolishing homes is "a policy of impotence that has proven its failure to quell the resistance and affect the morale of the resistance fighters and their struggling families".
Since early last year, deadly violence has rocked the northern West Bank, in conjunction with the rise of Palestinian armed groups and an increase of Israeli military operations and near-nightly raids on Palestinian towns and cities.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed this year, with the United Nations warning that 2023 is on track to be the deadliest year for Palestinians since it began recording deaths.

Members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) should impose an oil embargo and other sanctions on Israel and expel all Israeli ambassadors over a deadly attack on al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, according to Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian.
Amirabdollahian's remarks came in a statement on Wednesday amid an emergency OIC meeting in the Saudi city of Jeddah to discuss the escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
'The foreign minister calls for an immediate and complete embargo on Israel by Islamic countries, including oil sanctions, in addition to expelling Israeli ambassadors if relations with the Zionist regime have been established,' the ministry said.
Amirabdollahian also called for the formation of a team of Islamic lawyers to document potential war crimes committed by Israel in Gaza.
Iran has no diplomatic relations with Israel.
On Tuesday night, an Israeli air raid on a hospital in Gaza killed about 500 people, according to Palestinians, in one of the worst attacks since the violence began on October 7.
Gaza's Health Ministry spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qudra, said on Wednesday that hundreds were killed and rescue workers were still removing bodies from the rubble.
Pro-Palestinian protests erupted throughout the Middle East and North Africa following the attack and were staged at Israeli embassies in Jordan as well as Turkey and near the US embassy in Lebanon.
Demonstrations also took place in Iran, Morocco, Tunisia, Yemen and Iraq.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas cancelled a summit with his US counterpart and said the hospital blast was a 'hideous war massacre' and that 'Israel has crossed on red lines'.

But Israel's military has denied responsibility for the attack and claimed a misfired Palestinian rocket hit the hospital.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, 'The entire world should know: it was barbaric terrorists in Gaza that attacked the hospital in Gaza, not the IDF [Israeli forces].'
'Those who brutally murdered our children also murder their own children,' he said.
Health authorities in Gaza have said at least 3,300 people have died during the 11-day conflict, and a further 13,000 people have been wounded.
In Israel, the death toll stands at 1,400, with 4,475 injured.

German police raid Islamic centre over alleged ties to Iran, Hezbollah

Police in Germany have conducted raids at 54 sites across the country as part of an investigation into an Islamic centre for alleged links to Iran and the Tehran -backed group   .
The Ministry of the Interior said Thursday's operation primarily targeted the Islamic Centre of Hamburg (IZH) as well as five affiliate groups as hundreds of police conducted raids in seven German states.
"I want to make clear that we are acting against Islamists, not against a religion or another state," Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said.
"We have the Islamist scene in our sights," she said.
"Especially now, when many Jews feel particularly threatened, we do not tolerate Islamist propaganda or anti-Semitic and anti-Israel hate speech," she added.
The raids were carried out as Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities around the world say they are experiencing an   and intimidation as the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas intensifies.
Faeser said the IZH has long been monitored by the domestic intelligence agency. The ministry said the centre supported the 'revolutionary concept' championed by  , which may be a violation of Germany's constitutional order.
No arrests were made, and the government said the raids were focused on gathering evidence for its investigation into support for Hezbollah.
Last month, the IZH said it 'condemns every form of violence and extremism and has always advocated peace, tolerance and interreligious dialogue'.
The IZH runs a mosque in Hamburg. The ministry said intelligence indicates it exerts significant influence or full control over some other mosques and groups.
Germany banned Hezbollah in 2020. Any symbols of the group are banned, and its assets were confiscated. This month, the government announced a   of Hamas activities. It considers both "terrorist" organisations.
The German branch of Samidoun, known as the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, was also banned with Faeser saying it "supports and glorifies" groups including Hamas.
Hezbollah, which has ties to Hamas and receives weapons from Iran, has been exchanging fire with Israeli forces at the   since the war broke out on October 7.
German authorities have prohibited   in what they said are efforts to prevent public anti-Semitism and curb disorder.
Supporters of Palestine said they feel blocked from publicly expressing support or concern for people in Gaza without risking arrest, their jobs or immigration status.
While the authorities have said they are addressing anxieties about rising anti-Semitism, some of their actions have been criticised for penalising solidarity with Palestinians, and activists critical of Israel's war in Gaza have described an increasingly restrictive atmosphere.
  have been fired for social media posts about the conflict. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier recently drew criticism when he stated that German Arabs should take steps to   from Hamas.

Israeli minister dismisses US 'terror' label after deadly settler attack

August 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A member of Israel's far-right government has dismissed the United States' description of the killing of a Palestinian in an attack by Israeli settlers as a "terror attack".
"I wouldn't advise treating the US definition as a precise professional definition. At the end of the day, they are not drawing on intelligence, but on media reports," Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter was quoted by local media outlets as saying on Tuesday.
"Everything gets poured into media reports – things that are correct, things that are wrong, tendentious and other things. In the end of the day, what is important as far as we are concerned is what happened there," Dichter, a former head of the Shin Bet internal security service,told Israel's Army Radio.
Qusai Jamal Maatan, 19, was   in Burqa east of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Friday, as armed settlers stormed the village and sparked fighting with residents.
"We strongly condemn yesterday's terror attack by Israeli extremist settlers that killed a 19-year old Palestinian," the US State Department said in a statement late on Saturday, urging "full accountability and justice".
State Department spokesman Matthew Miller made clear on Monday that the word choice was not an accident.
"The thinking is that it was a terror attack, and we are concerned about it, and that's why we called it that," he told reporters.
"We have also been clear that accountability and justice should be pursued with equal rigour in all cases of violent extremism, whoever the perpetrators are," he said.
Miller noted that Israel detained two settlers, which he called "appropriate action'.
Israeli media reported that one of two suspects was a former aide to a lawmaker from the far-right Jewish Power party, whose leader Itamar Ben-Gvir is public security minister. Ben-Gvir,  , has previously called for the displacement of Palestinians.
According to Palestinians, the settlers were part of a group that threw rocks, torched cars and, when confronted by villagers, shot Maatan and wounded several others.
Initial findings by Israel's military cast the incident as a confrontation that escalated. A defence lawyer said the settlers acted in self-defence.
In its arraignment, a transcript of which was obtained by Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the state accused the settlers of "deliberate or depraved-indifference homicide" with a racist motivation.
Ben-Gvir said on social media that Palestinian stone throwers in Burqa "tried to murder Jews" and that he expected them to be fully investigated.
Spike in violence
  against Palestinians and their property are a regular occurrence. From physical attacks to arson and vandalism, many of these incidents often take place under the  .
Between 600,000 and 750,000 Israeli settlers live in more than 250 illegal settlements and outposts across the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are illegal under international law.
Fighting between Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank intensified early last year when Israel launched near-nightly raids into Palestinian areas.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed this year in the occupied Palestinian territories and the besieged Gaza Strip, with the majority of these fatalities recorded in the West Bank.
The figures indicate that 2023 is already the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since the United Nations began keeping track of fatalities in 2005.
The UN has warned of a dramatic spike in violence since Israel's right-wing government took office late last year in a coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
US President Joe Biden's administration has repeatedly criticised actions and statements from the coalition government while stopping short of countermeasures that could trigger public spats with Netanyahu.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Middle East war. The Palestinians want the territory as part of a future state. US-mediated negotiations with Israel to that end stalled almost a decade ago.
Meanwhile, Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has once again refused to allocate funds to Palestinians.
On Tuesday, Smotrichsaid Netanyahu supported his decision to freeze funds that are meant to be allocated to Arab municipalities and educational programmes in occupied East Jerusalem.
The funds amount to 200 million shekels ($53.7m).
On Sunday, Interior Minister Moshe Arbel demanded the release of 315 million shekels ($84.6m) that had previously been promised to Arab municipalities as part of development programmes, Haaretz reported.
The government's current   solidifies the ruling coalition's religious and pro-settlement policies.
Tens of millions of dollars have already been set aside for extreme pro-settler parties as well as settlement expansion projects.
In remarks to local media, Smotrichsaid: 'I refuse to fund incitement and terrorism.'

In Gaza, 'we hate the night for what Israel does to us'

October 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza Strip – When I was a kid, big, rumbling Israeli bulldozers rolled into our neighbourhood one day and flattened all the houses. Just like that.
The grownups were sad, but they did not seem surprised.
We moved from shelters to borrowed houses for years until we finally managed to find a home of our own in Fokhari, east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.
We're close to the Rafah crossing into Egypt and to the separation fence. It has been turbulent, but at least we haven't had to move so often.
A stained day
When I woke up on Saturday, it was to the sound of rockets being fired. We were pretty sure they were Palestinian rockets being fired into our occupied lands outside Gaza. Lands that our grandparents were forced out of 75 years ago during the Nakba, lands some of us have never been allowed to step onto.
They went on for hours. It wasn't clear what the reason was though. Was it retaliation because Israel assassinated a Hamas leader? They do that sometimes, assassinate people in the ruling party of Gaza.
Were the rockets a response to what was happening in   for the past week, the settler incursions and violence against Muslims trying to pray there?
It could have been anything, Israel does so much to Palestine and the Palestinians.

Then the mosque loudspeakers came on people started sending around news and pictures on their phones. A large group of resistance fighters had snuck out of Gaza, 'infiltrating' our own occupied lands.
The scenes were horrific, they resembled so many we had seen before from Gaza. But this time, the people lying dead on the ground were not Palestinians. Any and all deaths are traumatic.
It was surreal, like a horror film, staining the day.
Looking at our occupied lands
Palestinians poured out of their homes and into the streets – there was confusion in the air.
They shouted as the rockets fired by the resistance streaked overhead – any show of strength, of being able to stand up to the occupier soothed them a little, made a lifetime devoid of hope seem a little more bearable.
To know that Palestinian youth had entered Palestinian lands – lands that had always been so difficult to reach, if not impossible – and were fighting the occupier, face to face. And at the same time, to know that this occupier, supported by the occupier's powerful, rich friends, will now turn around and annihilate as many Palestinians as it can. What an internal conflict.
When Mohammed Deif, commander-in-chief of Hamas's armed wing, theIzz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, spoke, he told the world they were implementing a  , an actual deployment of ground forces.
The speech did not dissipate the fear and anxiety that hovers over any news of resistance acts. How many of Gaza's people would die this time?
He said the fence Israel had built to pen us in was now open, that people could go and enter their lands. Hundreds, thousands, of people, headed out of Khan Yunis to the fence.

Some were young, barely more than teenagers, while some were elderly people who had dreamt of returning to this occupied land since 1948.
The first moments were of intense joy documented on their mobile phones to share with the world. But eventually, everyone had to go home.
Mothers weep helplessly for their children
Warplanes began to prowl the skies above Gaza. Retaliation.
I heard the planes fire at people in the border areas.
Bodies began to arrive at the European Hospital by our house. News reports spoke of dozens wounded. The Ministry of Health announced there were 100 killed, and the number steadily increased.
The voices of the martyrs' families, full of pain and loss, filled the air. More than 50 had died in Khan Yunis.
Loss is so very painful.
These people had dreams, their families had a future they imagined for them, but now there is only great sorrow.
Mothers' tears for their children flowed in abundance as if to quench the land thirsty for their children.

Gaza's painful night
During the early hours of that night, Israel began annihilating families and destroying homes.
The extermination started in the south of the Gaza Strip. Nineteen members of the Abu Qouta family were killed in Rafah. A young family was massacred in Beit Hanoon further north – 18 people gone: men, women, children.
The missiles, large and heavy, send strong vibrations through the ground, light up the sky with an intense red colour, and perforate our eardrums with such loud explosions.
They drove scores of people who live in the border areas to take refuge in UNRWA schools, hoping that they would be safe. But in my experience, Israel does not care about such things.

Displacement and rage
It wasn't unusual to see people killed when I was a kid. "Martyrs!" The men would shout, scant comfort to the mothers who were screaming in horrified pain over the children snatched so cruelly from them. I was seven years old, marvelling at the level of emotion in the street.
Ten years later, I had to give up on being a high school student because we had to flee, displaced as we ran from the Israeli army's ground incursion of 2008.
The nights were the hardest, that's when you can't sleep and stay up, feverishly reading the news or waiting to hear anything.
Whole families stay in one room, so they can survive together or die together. It's a difficult thought to process, but this is what we feel in Gaza, especially during the nights.
As soon as we realised the next assault was coming, people rushed out to buy supplies for a few days, but no shops had enough stock to fulfil the demand. Electricity, internet and water are almost completely cut off.
We pray all the time. We never know when one of us may die as the Israeli army targets more and more homes. This morning, I woke up choking from something the missiles were carrying. There are claims of incendiary white phosphorous being used in the missiles. I don't know.
My friend lost her husband, another friend lost her brother, and the principal of my primary school lost her nephew.
I see horrific posts on Facebook. I can't console anyone – I can only cry.
We all need consolation during this assault, especially during the night.
We hate the night, not for what it is, but for what Israel does to us during its long, dark hours.
Translated from the Arabic.

On Egypt-Gaza border, blocked aid waits to reach Palestinians

'Open the Rafah crossing point!' This is, among other things, what several hundred demonstrators chanted while gathered on the evening of Wednesday, October 18 in front of the headquarters of the journalists' union in the centre of Cairo.
As if their cries had been heard, at the same time, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that 'Israel will not prevent humanitarian aid from Egypt as long as it concerns food, water and medicines for the civilian population in the south of the Gaza Strip' – aid coming through the   that the besieged Palestinian enclave shares with Egypt.
A wind of relief swept through the demonstrators as they continued singing. But for one of the journalists who wished to remain anonymous, this is only the first step.
'The opening of the crossing was from the beginning a humanitarian necessity. What happened in Gaza and what is still happening is a humanitarian crime and collective punishment rejected by all international conventions. Now the decision we need is that the UN Security Council imposes a ceasefire,' he said.
Humanitarian aid will not arrive in Gaza until at least Friday, October 20, even if the gates open sooner. On October 19, Egyptian workers were seen repairing the damage caused by four consecutive   in one week on the infrastructure of the Palestinian side - along the only entry point into Gaza that Israel does not control.
The Rafah crossing has effectively been closed since Israel began bombarding the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, and imposed a total blockade on food, water, fuel and electricity in retaliation from Hamas's surprise attack on October 7.
At least 1,400 people were killed in Israel, while more than 3,700 Palestinians have been killed by ongoing Israeli air strikes in Gaza. International aid was piling up on the Egyptian side of the border, particularly at El Arish International Airport. More than a hundred trucks loaded with humanitarian supplies are waiting for their transfer near the Rafah crossing point.
The opening of the crossing point has been demanded for many days by the Egyptian authorities and many Arab countries. Twice last week, a rumour of an agreement circulated, suggesting its imminent opening. But nothing happened.
'Until now, the Israeli government has not taken a position on opening the Rafah crossing from the Gaza side to allow the entrance of assistance and exit of citizens of third countries,' declared Egypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry on October 16.
It was ultimately through the mediation of United States President  , who visited Israel on October 18, that Israel finally agreed to the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Initially, 20 trucks will cross, Biden noted on the plane taking him back to Washington, DC. 'We are going to get people out,' Biden said.
More than 500 foreign nationals or dual-national Palestinians, massed on the other side of the border, have been awaiting their evacuation for almost a week. They include several Palestinian Americans.
Yet, in Cairo, concern persists over the prospect of forced population displacements imposed by Israel spilling over into Egyptian territory.
On several occasions since the October 7 attack, Israeli officials have suggested setting up refugee camps in Sinai to accommodate civilians from Gaza.
That would be crossing a 'red line', Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has said, opposing "the liquidation of the Palestinian issue through military instruments, or any attempts to forcibly displace the Palestinians from their land, or for this to happen at the expense of countries in the region'.
It's a sentiment that the journalists' union echoed.
'Neither Negev, nor Sinai, Palestine is ours,' protesters from the union chanted on Wednesday evening.
Fatma Khafagy, a member of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party, still wants to believe in dialogue. 'The Arab countries must be able to bring Netanyahu to the political arena, not that of war, and bring about a two-state solution," she said. "Palestine belongs to the Palestinians and they must be able to stay there.'
For many Palestinians living in Cairo, the idea that a new mass displacement of Palestinians — as happened in 1948 during the creation of Israel — could occur is more fantasy than a real risk.
'The people of Gaza are heroes and if they have to die, they will die on their land," Mahmoud Waleed, originally from Rafah in the Gaza Strip, says with a look of pride. Since the start of the conflict on October 7, Waleed, who works in a furniture factory, has himself tried three times to return to Gaza — in vain.
The Egyptian army prohibits entry into North Sinai. So Mahmoud tries to help his compatriots who are victims of Israeli fire in the enclave. With several friends from the Palestinian community in Cairo, they launched an appeal for donations which was successful.
'We managed to fill the trunks of about seven cars with food, blankets, clothes and medicines,' explained the 34-year-old. All this was transported to the border area on October 17 with the help of the Egyptian Red Crescent.
But others are more worried about how far Israel might go in its attack on Gaza.
'There is an Israeli plan of ethnic cleansing, that is what they are pushing towards,' said Nada, a human rights activist from Ramallah in her 30s.
'Most of them [Palestinian people] do not want to leave Gaza. We must remember that a large percentage of them are already refugees and they do not want to be displaced again.'

There was intense fighting reported around Gaza's Indonesian Hospital on Monday.
Israeli   the hospital in northern Gaza after artillery fire killed at least 12 Palestinians in the complex.
Here is what's to know:
What is happening at Gaza's Indonesian Hospital?
A shell struck the second floor of the Indonesian Hospital, killing at least 12 people, according to a medical worker inside the facility and the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
Ashraf al-Qudra, Gaza's Health Ministry spokesperson, told Al Jazeera that '  .'
'The Indonesian Hospital staff are insisting they will stay to treat the wounded. There are about 700 people, including medical staff and injured people, inside the hospital,' he said.
Indonesia's Foreign Ministry said it had lost contact with three Indonesian volunteers at the hospital who are part of the group that set up the facility in 2016 with the country's funding.
Marwan Abdallah, a medical worker at the Indonesian Hospital, said that Israeli tanks were operating less than 200 metres (656 feet) from the hospital, and that Israeli snipers could be seen on the roofs of nearby buildings.
Another medical worker told Al Jazeera that the shelling is intense and indiscriminate on the hospital building, at the entrance and at the windows. According to the medic, everyone in the hospital has gathered at the centre of the main building.
Where is the Indonesian Hospital?
 , a city of about 90,000 people in north Gaza, the hospital sits on some 16,000 square metres (172,200 square feet) of land donated by the government of Gaza in 2011.
The   has been sheltering hundreds of displaced people who sought asylum there. It's also close to the Jabalia refugee camp.
The area around the hospital has been struck multiple times by Israeli forces, with at least two civilians killed in those strikes between October 7 and October 28, according to Human Rights Watch.
The hospital cost almost $8m to build. It was funded by donations from Indonesian citizens in conjunction with groups including the Indonesian Red Cross Society and the Muhammadiyah Society, one of Indonesia's largest Muslim organisations.

What has Israel said?
Israel has long accused Hamas of using hospitals and other civilian sites to establish command posts and hide weapons.
The army has previously said that it believes the Indonesian Hospital was built on a Hamas tunnel system, in allegations that mirror those that Israel has made against al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Al-Shifa, the Gaza Strip's main hospital,   after coming under Israeli bombardment.
Why is Israel targeting Palestinian hospitals?
Six weeks into its war on Gaza,   on hospitals have emerged almost as a motif of the conflict. At least 21 of Gaza's 35 hospitals – including the Strip's solo cancer centre – are completely out of service, and others have been damaged and are short of medicines and essential supplies.
Commentator Taghreed El-Khodary said that Israel 'convinced' the world that al-Shifa Hospital was the headquarters of Hamas because it was the easiest route for them to invade Gaza.
'They know it is the safest part to go and impose a kind of military headquarters for them in Gaza City. They couldn't come from the east. Now this is what they're doing, going to the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya to also impose another headquarters for them to attack and kill more civilians,' El-Khodary  .
According to Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Doha-based Middle East Council on Global Affairs, this is a  .
'Attacking hospitals tells the population that nowhere for [Palestinians] is safe,' Rahman told Al Jazeera, adding that Israel acts with 'total impunity'.
Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the act of making Palestinians feel unsafe in every facility in the Gaza Strip is to quell any form of resistance.
'This is part of a long-standing pattern of harassment of medical staff and services, in which Israel demonstrates to Palestinians that no one and no space is safe,' Mustafa told Al Jazeera.

'Shadowbanning': Are social media giants censoring pro-Palestine voices?

October 24th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
At the end of last week, Thomas Maddens, a filmmaker and activist based in Belgium, noticed something strange. A video about Palestine that he posted to TikTok with the word 'genocide' suddenly stopped getting engagement on the platform after an initial spike.
'I thought I would have got millions of views,' Maddens told Al Jazeera, 'but the engagement had stopped.'
Maddens is one of the hundreds of social media users who are accusing the world's largest social media platforms – Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube and TikTok – of censoring accounts or actively reducing the reach of pro-Palestine content, a practice known as shadowbanning.
Authors, activists, journalists, filmmakers and regular users around the world have said posts containing hashtags like 'FreePalestine' and 'IStandWithPalestine' as well as messages expressing support for civilian Palestinians killed by Israeli forces are being hidden by the platforms.

Some users have also accused Instagram, owned by Meta, of arbitrarily taking down posts that simply mention Palestine for violating 'community guidelines'. Others said their Instagram Stories were hidden for sharing information about protests in support of Palestine in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. Some also reportedly complained about the word "terrorist" appearing near their Instagram biographies.
In a post on X on October 15, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone blamed the reduced reach of posts on a bug.
'This bug affected accounts equally around the globe and had nothing to do with the subject matter of the content – and we fixed it as quickly as possible,' Stone wrote.
When asked about the accusations of shadowbanning, Stone pointed Al Jazeera to a blog post that Meta published highlighting its latest efforts in tackling misinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war. The post said users who don't agree with the company's moderation decisions may appeal.
The BBC reported that Meta apologised for adding the word terrorist to pro-Palestinian accounts, saying the problem that 'briefly caused inappropriate Arabic translations" has been fixed.
A TikTok spokesperson told Al Jazeera that the company 'does not moderate or remove content based on political sensitivities', adding that the platform removes 'content that violates community guidelines, which apply equally to all content on TikTok'.
YouTube and X did not respond to Al Jazeera's requests for comment.
Civil rights groups aren't buying the platforms' denials.
This month, 48 organisations, including 7amleh, the Arab Centre for Social Media Advancement, which advocates for digital rights of Palestinian and Arab civil society, issued a statement urging tech companies to respect Palestinian digital rights during the ongoing war.
'We are [concerned] about significant and disproportionate censorship of Palestinian voices through content takedowns and hiding hashtags, amongst other violations,' the statement said. 'These restrictions on activists, civil society and human rights defenders represent a grave threat to freedom of expression and access to information, freedom of assembly, and political participation.'

Jalal Abukhater, 7amleh's advocacy manager, told Al Jazeera that the organisation had documented 238 cases of pro-Palestinian censorship, mostly on Facebook and Instagram. These included content takedowns and account restrictions.
'There is a disproportionate effort that targets Palestine-related content,' Abukhater told Al Jazeera in an interview. 'In contrast, the official Israeli narrative, as excessively violent as it could get, has got more of a free reign because Meta considers it to be coming from "official" entities, including from the Israeli military and government officials.'
'Getting censored'
A 26-year-old marketing manager from Brussels who asked to remain anonymous to protect her identity, noticed that engagement she received on Instagram Stories dipped sharply when she posted about Palestine from her personal account. 'I have around 800 followers, and I usually get 200 views for a story,' she told Al Jazeera. 'But when I started posting about Palestine, I noticed my views getting lower.'
The woman said she was concerned because her story didn't contain graphic images or include hate speech. '[They were] about understanding that Palestinian people are human and deserve to live freely in peace in the region,' she said. 'Why is that getting censored?'

Another Instagram user, a 29-year-old mechanical engineer from India who also requested anonymity, noticed her Instagram Stories about protests in Los Angeles and California's Bay Area had zero views even after an hour. 'That was unusual,' she said. She then posted a selfie, which got the usual engagement she usually gets, she said.
Other users had similar experiences and took to the social media platforms themselves to complain. 'After posting an Instagram story about the war in Gaza yesterday, my account was shadowbanned,' Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Azmat Khan posted on X. 'Many colleagues and journalists [sic] friends have reported the same. It's an extraordinary threat to the flow of information and credible journalism about an unprecedented war.'
Pakistani author Fatima Bhutto also said Instagram was shadowbanning her and limiting comments and story views. 'I am learning so much about how democracies and big tech work together to suppress information during illegal wars they are unable to manufacture consent for,' she posted on X. In a video she posted to Instagram, she said her posts weren't showing up in her followers' feeds on the platform.
Khan and Bhutto did not respond to requests for comment from Al Jazeera.
Ameer Al-Khatahtbeg, the 25-year-old founder and editor-in-chief of Muslim, a news website that focuses on Muslim issues, noticed that posts from the publication reached significantly fewer people on Instagram over the past few days, plummeting from 1.2 million before the start of the war, to just over 160,000 a week into the war.
'The most major form of censorship that is being implemented is towards any account mentioning keywords such as 'Palestine', 'Gaza', 'Hamas', even 'Al Quds' & 'Jerusalem' in Instagram stories and posts alongside hashtags such as #FreePalestine, and #IStandWithPalestine,' Al-Khatahtbeg told Al Jazeera. 'These posts aren't reaching Instagram's Explore page and are showing up on people's main feed days later.'
Muslim wasn't the only publication that accused social media platforms of censorship. Days after Hamas first attacked Israel, Mondoweiss, a pro-Palestine news outlet based in the United States, said TikTok banned its account and only restored it hours later after an online outcry. The Palestine-based Quds News Network posted on X that its Facebook page was suspended by Meta.
This isn't the first time that social media platforms have been accused of censoring Palestinian voices.
An independent report  commissioned by Meta after Israel's war on Gaza in 2021 and made public a year later found that the company had negatively affected the human rights of Palestinian users in areas such as "freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, political participation, and non-discrimination".
According to findings by 7amleh shared with Al Jazeera, Facebook received 913 appeals from Israel's government to restrict or remove content on its platform from January to June 2020. Facebook consented to 81 percent of these requests.
'This isn't new. Palestinians have faced censorship from Meta before and are experiencing it again,' Al-Khatahtbeg told Al Jazeera. A Meta spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
'Tricking the algorithm'
Some people who said they experienced censorship on social media have been resorting to workarounds.
When posting to Instagram for instance, a Palestinian activist who did not want to be named for his safety told Al Jazeera that they 'started breaking up' words. 'When I wrote 'Palestine' or 'ethnic cleansing' or 'apartheid', I'd break the word with dots or slashes. I'd replace the letter 'A' with '@'. This is how I started tricking the algorithm.'
Mohammad Darwish, 31, the founder of a Bydotpy, a blockchain company based in Cairo, Egypt, created a website called 'Free Palestine.bydotpy' that automates the same process. Typing 'Gaza' into his website, for instance, automatically changes it to 'ğaza', which users can then copy and paste into the social media app of their choice.
'I don't like anyone controlling me, and during tensions in Sheikh Jarrah, a Palestinian neighbourhood in East Jerusalem, I experienced a lot of restrictions,' Darwish told Al Jazeera, adding that Facebook also warned him about spreading 'hate speech' back then.

'As a community of developers, we have a principle that 'there is nothing that cannot be done with code.' So I developed this tool, which has two versions, one for the Arabic language and the other for the English language,' he said.
'The function of the tool is to change the form of sentences to make it difficult for artificial intelligence and Facebook algorithms to understand the meaning of the text,' he added.
Shortly after noticing user complaints about social media censorship of pro-Palestine content, Florida-based law firm called Muslim Legal that focuses on helping American Muslims, set up a page on its website where anyone who had faced such censorship could share their experience. At the time of publishing, Muslim Legal had received more than 450 submissions.
'We noticed pages that were simply speaking out for justice for Palestinians were being simply shut down and banned without warning,' Hassan Shibly, the firm's founder, told Al Jazeera in an interview. 'We were also seeing people restricted for innocent comments."
Shibly is now trying to take these complaints to the platforms to try to resolve them.
'The use of social media by the community is so essential,' he said. 'It's one of the ways we can push back against Islamophobic narratives. It's one of the ways we can expose the war crimes that are happening. And it's one of the tools we have to dismantle the propaganda and misinformation that is being used to justify the ethnic cleansing happening in Palestine by the Israelis.'
Need for transparency
In August, the European Union passed the Digital Services Act (DSA), seeking to tame Big Tech. Under this regulation, social media platforms are required to comply with rules that ensure digital security and also safeguard users' freedom of expression.
'Platforms need to be very transparent and clear on what content is permitted under their terms and consistently and diligently enforce their own policies,' an EU spokesperson told Al Jazeera in a statement. 'This is particularly relevant when it comes to violent and terrorist content.'
Crucially, the DSA also mandates transparency around shadowbanning and other kinds of content moderation.
'When an account gets restricted, the user must be informed,' the spokesperson said and added that users had the right to appeal the decision.
Some experts, however, expressed doubts on the effectiveness of the DSA in the current situation.
'In principle, the DSA covers shadowbanning,' Andrea Renda, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies, told Al Jazeera, 'but in practice, it is going to be harder to prosecute this behaviour compared to the spread of misinformation on these platforms.'
Ultimately, censorship of Palestinian content hurts journalists, civil society and human rights defenders during a time of crisis, Abukhater said. 'It especially prevents Palestinians from establishing context surrounding the events affecting their lives during this moment.
"It is crucial for companies to recognise their role at this vital moment and recognise that maintaining a steady flow of information to and from Palestine is absolutely essential to save lives and mitigate the human rights impact the censorship could have had.'

Beirut, Lebanon - The Lebanese armed group   and Israel's military have exchanged artillery fire and other attacks across their shared border over the last week, escalating fears that a   could erupt.
The violence comes amid the ongoing   and   of the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian territory at the heart of the Israeli-Hamas conflict.
Israel   on Hamas on October 8, one day after the Palestinian group launched a   from Gaza that killed an estimated 1,400 Israelis. In the wake of Israel's aerial bombing of Gaza, Palestinian deaths have soared to  .
The violence has spurred the Iran-backed Hezbollah to say it would stand '  ' with the Palestinian people. Its subsequent   — and Israel's   — have reawakened memories of a   between the two forces that has been relatively dormant since 2006.
As tensions threaten to reignite, here's what you need to know about the history of the Lebanese-Israeli conflict.

Pre-1948: Before the establishment of the state of Israel, Lebanon debated what kind of relationship it would have with the Zionists in Palestine, according to Makram Rabah, a history lecturer with the American University of Beirut.
  gained independence from France in 1943. Certain nationalists in the newly formed republic believed in an alliance of minorities that would see a Christian-Lebanese nation align with the Zionists.
But Lebanon's founding fathers — primarily Riad al-Solh and Bechara el-Khoury — felt they could not have a relationship with Israel and maintain good relations with neighbouring Arab states, according to Rabah.
1948: The state of Israel   on May 14. The next day, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon declared war on Israel. Lebanon had the smallest army of the Arab nations.
The Israeli forces repelled the Arab fighters and temporarily occupied part of south Lebanon. An armistice was signed on March 23, 1949, and Israeli troops withdrew to the internationally recognised border.

1965: The emergence of  , a Palestinian nationalist group, as a powerful force in the region coincided with renewed border skirmishes.
'The Lebanese-Israeli border was quiet until around 1965 when the Fatah movement started launching low-intensity attacks on Israeli positions,' Hilal Khashan, a professor of political science at the American University of Beirut, told Al Jazeera.
The Lebanese army attempted to counter Fatah's operations, but public opinion was split.
Many in the country's Muslim community and in the secular or pan-Arabist left sympathised with the Palestinian cause. However, Lebanon's nationalist right — predominantly made up of major Maronite parties, representing a largely Christian base — did not want to be implicated in a conflict they felt did not concern them.
1967: Tensions between Israel and surrounding Arab states escalated into the   on June 5.
But  , 'Arab militaries were soundly defeated by the Israelis,' Khashan said. As a result of Israel's victory, Palestinians were expelled from Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in what became known as the '  ' or  .
Lebanon's military involvement in the Six-Day War was minimal, but the repercussions were significant. Thousands of Palestinian refugees fled to Lebanon, and violence was incited against Lebanon's Jewish population, leading many to emigrate.
A year later, Yasser Arafat's Fatah took control of the   (PLO), a broad coalition representing the Palestinian people.
'Palestinians now started to launch operations against Israel with the 14 groups under the umbrella of the PLO,' Khashan said.

1969: On November 2, delegations led by PLO leader Arafat and Lebanese army General Emile Bustani signed the Cairo Accord.
The agreement transferred control over 16 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon to the Palestinian Armed Struggle Command, an entity created by the PLO.
'The Cairo Accord gave the PLO official recognition to launch operations from Lebanon into occupied Palestine,' Rabah said.
1970: Palestinian fighters led a failed uprising in Jordan, resulting in their expulsion by King Hussein in September. The event would be called Black September.
In the aftermath, the PLO relocated its main headquarters from Jordan to the Lebanese capital Beirut and its military headquarters to south Lebanon.
1973: On the night of April 9 and continuing into the early hours of April 10, Israeli special forces took speedboats and landed on Lebanese beaches. They assassinated three PLO leaders. Part of Israel's Operation Wrath of God, the raid became known in Arabic as the Verdun Massacre.

1978: Lebanon-based Palestinian fighters continued to conduct cross-border raids, and in March, Israel invaded Lebanon, advancing as far as the Litani River.
In response, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 425, which called for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces. It also established the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which still operates to this day.
At the time, Israelis armed and financed the South Lebanese Army, composed of Lebanese Christians. Palestinian groups, meanwhile, were backed by Syria.
1979: A peace agreement between Egypt and Israel — stemming from the previous year's Camp David Accords — shifts the balance of power in the Middle East.
'Arab states came to the conclusion that they couldn't attack Israel without Egypt,' Khashan said.

1982: On June 6, 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon under the pretence of stopping PLO raids across its border. The Israeli forces, however, progressed as far north as the capital Beirut, laying siege to the largely pro-Palestinian West Beirut.
The invasion led to the eventual departure of the PLO from Lebanon under the supervision of a multinational peacekeeping force on September 1.
Israel's invasion of Lebanon would also help spark the creation of Hezbollah, with the backing of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. 'Iran claimed responsibility for the Palestinian [cause] at a time when Arab countries had abandoned it,' Khashan said.
Meanwhile, on September 14, Lebanese Forces (LF) leader and President-elect Bashir Gemayel was assassinated by a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. Two days later, with cover from the Israeli military, fellow LF leader Elie Hobeika rallied right-wing Christian forces which killed hundreds, if not thousands, of Palestinians and Lebanese Shias.
This is now known as the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Although the full number of casualties remains uncertain, some estimates put the death toll between 2,000 to 3,500.
1985: Israel withdrew to the Litani River in south Lebanon and created what it called a security zone there. The Israeli occupation of the southern region continued until 2000.

1993: Israel launched what it called Operation Accountability in Lebanon after Hezbollah operations killed at least five Israeli soldiers. Also known as the Seven-Day War, the conflict resulted in thousands of buildings bombed, with 118 Lebanese civilians killed and 500 more wounded.
1996: Casualties on both sides of the Lebanon-Israel border gave rise to Operation Grapes of Wrath on April 11. Israel bombarded Lebanon with shells and air raids, resulting in the Qana Massacre of more than 100 Lebanese people, including at least 37 children.
2000: On May 24, Israel declared it would withdraw its forces to the Blue Line, its UN-designated border. The decision effectively ended the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon. The Lebanese people celebrate May 25 as a national holiday.
'There was a widespread opposition in Israel' to the occupation in Lebanon, Khashan explained.
However, as Israeli forces retreated, many members of the South Lebanese Army joined them in exiting Lebanon.

2006: In an operation into Israeli territory, Hezbollah killed three soldiers and captured two. Hezbollah demanded the release of Lebanese prisoners in exchange for the Israeli soldiers. But as Hezbollah sent rockets and Israel responded with airstrikes, the July War broke out and lasted 34 days.
Approximately 1,200 Lebanese people died and 4,400 were wounded, mostly civilians. Israel, meanwhile, reported 158 deaths, most of them soldiers.
'2006 wasn't as much a war between Lebanon and Israel as much as it was between Hezbollah and the latter,' Rabah said.
2023: Until recently, the border had been relatively quiet. Occasional rockets or drones crossed from Lebanon into Israel without leading to serious escalation, while Israel violated Lebanese airspace more than 22,000 times from 2007 to 2022.
But that relative stability changed in the last week. As Israel and Hezbollah trade attacks, deaths have started to mount. Among the casualties are a Lebanese journalist for Reuters named  , an elderly Lebanese couple and one Israeli civilian.

UN says Gaza Health Ministry death tolls in previous wars 'credible'
Newstex Blogs

October 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United Nations has said the figures provided by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza have proven consistently credible in the past, after US President Joe Biden   on the death toll provided by local authorities.
Speaking with reporters on Friday, the UN agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) chief, Philippe Lazzarini, said that few have doubted the credibility of the figures in previous wars.
"In the past, the five, six cycles of conflict in the Gaza Strip, these figures were considered as credible and no one ever really challenged these figures," Lazzarini told reporters in Jerusalem.
The Health Ministry, which utilises data from morgues and   to reach its figures, released a 212-page document on Thursday with names and identity numbers of those killed.
Lazzarini's comments come days after Biden said he had 'no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed' amid Israel's   of Gaza.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, US National Security Council spokesperson   said the 'so-called' Gaza Health Ministry was 'a front for Hamas', the Palestinian armed group which governs Gaza.
Biden's comments have drawn criticism from Palestinian rights advocates, as Israel carries out relentless air raids on Gaza after   to food, water, electricity, and fuel for the enclave's more than 2.3 million residents.
'To dispute those figures was really, really just putting both feet in with Israel on this, in yet another way that dehumanises Palestinians,' Yara Asi, a Palestinian American public health expert at the University of Central Florida, previously told Al Jazeera.
The Health Ministry on Friday said at least 7,326 Palestinians have been killed and more than 18,000 wounded since Israel began bombarding Gaza after the October 7 attack of Hamas fighters on southern Israel. More than 1,400 people were killed in the attack, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel later imposed a "complete siege" on Gaza and its bombing campaign has left entire   reduced to rubble and hundreds of thousands of people displaced.
Humanitarian groups, international organisations including the UN, news organisations, and branches of the US government have cited Health Ministry figures and generally found them reliable across several previous rounds of fighting in Gaza.
Previous death tolls have also held up to scrutiny when subjected to independent investigations. A report by the news outlet Huffington Post found  that the Biden administration's State Department has consistently relied on them over the last two weeks, raising few concerns about their accuracy.
'The numbers may not be perfectly accurate on a minute-to-minute basis,' Michael Ryan, of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Programme, told The Associated Press news agency. 'But they largely reflect the level of death and injury.'
Following   at the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza last week, which Israel and the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) have blamed on each other, health authorities said about 500 people had been killed.
The figure was later revised downwards to 471. According to the Reuters news agency, an unclassified US intelligence report estimated that the "number of deaths is probably at the low end of the 100-to-300 spectrum".

Why does Israel target Palestinian hospitals? Psyops, say analysts

November 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli tanks close in on a Palestinian hospital. Doctors and medical staff are warned that they must leave — with or without patients in need. Artillery assaults follow, even if thousands of people are still inside.
On Monday, it was the turn of the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, Gaza. At least 12 people have been killed in Israeli attacks on the facility, even as armoured vehicles edge closer and closer to the hospital.
But it was only the latest medical centre to face the wrath of the Israeli army.
Six weeks into its war on Gaza, Israel's attacks on hospitals have emerged almost as a motif of the conflict, even though  ,   and   have not been spared either. At least 21 of Gaza's 35 hospitals — including the strip's solo cancer centre — are completely out of service, and others have been damaged and are short of medicines and essential supplies.
On Sunday,   from al-Shifa Hospital to Rafah in the south of the Gaza Strip after weeks of being fed formula mixed with contaminated water, without incubators that shut off from a lack of fuel caused by Israel's near-complete siege on the enclave since the October 7 Hamas attack. At least eight babies had already died.
Israeli forces have, in effect, occupied al-Shifa since last week after bombarding parts of the hospital. As with Gaza's other hospitals, al-Shifa was sheltering thousands of civilians displaced by Israeli bombing, in addition to patients and medics.
On Friday, Israel's military extended its approach in Gaza to the occupied West Bank, where armoured vehicles  . The Ibn Sina Hospital, one of the largest in the West Bank, was raided. And in early November, Israeli forces arrested some patients and their attendants from an  .
But why does Israel target Palestinian hospitals given that this also brings significant criticism from leading human rights organisations, which have  ?
Let them know: 'Nowhere is safe'
Officially, Israel insists that it is targeting facilities that house Hamas fighters or infrastructure.
Israel  , for instance. But Hamas has denied that claim, and days after taking control of the facility, Israel has been unable to provide strong evidence to back its assertions.
The real reason Israel targets hospitals is different, according to Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Doha-based Middle East Council on Global Affairs. It is a form of psychological warfare, he said.
'Attacking hospitals tells the population that nowhere for [Palestinians] is safe,' Rahman told Al Jazeera, adding that Israel acts with 'total impunity'.
Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at the InternationalCrisis Group, said the act of making Palestinians feel unsafe in every facility in the strip is to quell any form of resistance.
'This is part of a longstanding pattern of harassment of medical staff and services, in which Israel demonstrates to Palestinians that no one and no space is safe,' Mustafa told Al Jazeera.
'It is a systematic attempt to intimidate local populations and undermine their will to resist,' she added.
Throughout the war, Israel has targeted a number of ambulances and medical facilities in the West Bank and Gaza, claiming that Palestinian fighters use them to move around and shelter, without providing evidence for these claims, the analyst said.
Green light from the US
Israel also targets civilian buildings like hospitals because it can get away with it, said Trita Parsi, the executive vice president at the Washington-headquartered Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
'The only scrutiny and the only imposed limits that matter are the ones that come from the United States,' Parsi told Al Jazeera.
'Israel's calculation is that international outcry doesn't matter as long as the   on Israeli actions,' he added.
In the absence of this pressure from the US, combined with the 'most extremist' and right-wing government Israel has ever had, 'Israelis are taking the opportunity to do things they otherwise could not do', Parsi explained.
Still, as the war wages on, the US may be compelled to urge its ally to dial down the ferocity of its attacks, as its image wears down around the world.
'The US's global standing and credibility is plummeting as a result of its green light for Israeli actions of this kind,' said Parsi.
'It's possible [this may not] continue for much longer, because the damage this is doing to the United States is simply not tolerable.'

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A humanitarian aid convoy has come under fire in Gaza City, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Two trucks were damaged and a driver lightly wounded as the ICRC convoy, which was carrying "lifesaving medical supplies to health facilities including to Al Quds hospital of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society," was hit by fire, the medical NGO said on Tuesday.
The ICRC said it was "deeply troubled" about the incident and reminded the warring "parties of their obligation under international humanitarian law to respect and protect humanitarian workers at all times".
The statement did not identify the source of the fire on the convoy, which consisted of five trucks and two ICRC vehicles.
We are deeply troubled that our humanitarian convoy in Gaza City came under fire today. It was carrying lifesaving medical supplies to health facilities, including Al Quds @PalestineRCS  hospital.
Under IHL, humanitarian workers must be protected.

— ICRC in Israel & OT (@ICRC_ilot) November 7, 2023
Following the incident, the convoy altered its route to reach al-Shifa Hospital, where it delivered the medical supplies, the ICRC said.
The convoy then accompanied six ambulances with critically wounded patients to the Rafah crossing from Gaza to Egypt.
'These are not the conditions under which humanitarian personnel can work,' said William Schomburg, head of theICRCsub-delegation in Gaza.
'Ensuring that vital aid can reach medical facilities is a legal obligation under international humanitarian law."
ICRC, a neutral organisation based in Geneva, has escorted patients and transported freed captives out of Gaza.
Since October 7, the Israeli bombardment has killed more than 10,000 Palestinians, about 40 percent of them children, according to counts by Gaza's health officials.
Nearly two-thirds of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are internally displaced, according to United Nations figures, with thousands seeking refuge at hospitals, including in makeshift canvas shelters in their car parks.
Hospitals across the enclave have come under fire, with many struggling to continue operating amid shortages of fuel and medical supplies.
The UN says Gaza's health, sanitation, water and food services are nearing 'breaking point'.

Iran warns Israel of regional escalation if Gaza ground offensive launched

Tehran, Iran – Iran has warned Israel of regional escalation if the Israeli military enters Gaza for a ground invasion as the war with Hamas enters its second week.
"If the measures aimed at immediately stopping the Israeli attacks that are killing children in the Gaza Strip end in a deadlock, it is highly probable that many other fronts will be opened. This option is not ruled out and this is becoming increasingly more probable," Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told Al Jazeera on Sunday.
"If the Zionist entity [Israel] decides to enter Gaza, the resistance leaders will turn it into a graveyard of the occupation soldiers," he added.
Since the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched an   inside the Israeli territory on October 7, Israeli air strikes have killed more than 2,670 people – a quarter of them children – and wounded nearly 10,000 others in Gaza, where a catastrophic humanitarian crisis is unfolding.
The United Nations estimates one million people – nearly   – have been forced from their homes, as the Israeli military prepares for an expected ground invasion.
At least 1,400 people, including 289 soldiers and some foreign nationals, have been killed on the Israeli side, officials said on Sunday.
Tehran has rejected claims it was directly involved in the Hamas assault on Israel last weekend.
Amir-Abdollahian on Saturday met with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Qatar, where they discussed the Gaza crisis "and agreed to continue cooperation", Hamas said in a statement.
Also on Saturday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said all Islamic   to come to the aid of the Palestinians.
With God's grace, this movement that has started in #Palestine  will advance and result in a complete victory for the Palestinians.

Iran has also engaged in a diplomatic offensive in an effort to stop the Israeli attacks on Gaza.
Amir-Abdollahian also visited Iraq, Lebanon and Syria, where he met President Bashar al-Assad after Israel bombed the airports in Aleppo and Damascus.
Earlier on Sunday, the Iranian minister met Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Doha.
'If the attacks of the Zionist regime against civilians and the defenceless people of Gaza persist, no one can guarantee that the situation will be under control and the scope of the fighting won't expand,' he told Qatar's emir, who also earlier held a telephone conversation with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.

Amir-Abdollahian reiterated Tehran's call for an urgent meeting of the foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Gaza.
Regional power Saudi Arabia has reportedly put its   on hold, with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday   with the Iranian president on the Israel-Hamas war – their first phone call since restoring diplomatic ties.
Meanwhile, Israel is also preparing for the possibility that the war may expand to multiple fronts. It said it bombed the airports in Syria to stop potential Iranian mobilisation efforts there.
On Sunday, Israel declared its border with Lebanon a closed military zone as clashes with Hezbollah continued.
(Al Jazeera)
On Saturday, the US-based news website Axios reported that Iran has warned Israel through the UN that it does not want the Gaza conflict to escalate, but will have to respond if Israeli strikes continue.
Iran has not officially commented on the Axios report.
How Iranian media covered the Gaza war
The Iranian media have extensively covered the recent developments, especially the losses suffered by Israel since the Hamas attacks last week.
In the first few days of the war, several Iranian newspapers used an image of Palestinians standing on top of a captured Israeli tank and waving the Palestinian flag as their front page cover.
'Mortal wound' – said a headline in 'Iran', the official newspaper of the government, which in its op-ed said scenes created by Hamas in the occupied territories 'seemed apocalyptic' and showed 'cowardly Zionists running away'.
Kayhan, the ultraconservative newspaper whose editor-in-chief is directly appointed by Ayatollah Khamenei, said four 'catastrophes' await Israel if it decides to go ahead with a ground assault on Gaza: sustaining heavy casualties due to the complexities of urban warfare; risking the lives of dozens of Israelis taken captive by Hamas; facing mounting pressure from the international community; and growing 'regional isolation' as  .
Khorasan, another conservative newspaper, went with 'The Unprecedented Humiliation of the 'Losing Horse'' as its main headline earlier this week – a reference to comments made by Khamenei, who warned that any country that decides to normalise relations with Israel will engage in a 'losing gamble'.
'As the Europeans say, they are betting on the losing horse,' Khamenei had said.
But highlighting the big hit inside Israeli territory and how it retaliated by targeting civilians in Gaza was not limited to conservative newspapers only. More moderate and reformist media outlets also raised similar issues in their coverage of the conflict.
'Israel's Black Saturday' was the headline in the reformist Shargh, while Etemad detailed how Hamas had 'attacked the heart of occupied Palestine'.
Etemad also underlined the 2.2 million Gazans in danger and Israel's 'impossible' order for over one million to flee northern Gaza as it cut off their water, electricity and internet. The newspaper also condemned   in Gaza and Lebanon.
'The political condition inside Israel is quickly turning against [Israeli PM] Benjamin Netanyahu and the ruling coalition due to hit the Zionist regime took from the resistance forces,' it wrote.

A humanitarian pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas will extend by two days, mediator Qatar and Hamas have said, hours before an initial   in Gaza was set to expire.
"The State of Qatar announces that, as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip," Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari said on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday.
Qatar, the United States and Egypt have engaged in intense negotiations to establish and prolong the truce in Gaza, which mediators had said was designed to be broadened and expanded.
Over the course of the initial truce a total 50 civilian hostages, women and children, were expected to be freed by Hamas.
In exchange, 150 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel were to be released and more humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza.
According to Ghazi Hamad, from the Hamas political bureau, an extension of the four-day truce was always a possibility.
"It [the possibility of an extension] was written in the agreement, that if Hamas gives more hostages, there will be more days of the ceasefire," he told Al Jazeera.
"We have now agreed to release more hostages and extend the agreement for two days. This is good news for our people, especially the people of Gaza.
"I hope we can extend it until we reach the end of this war. We want to end the war. We are in a temporary ceasefire but we are trying to extend it. There is lots of support from Qatar, Egypt and many Western governments to end this catastrophe," he added.
During the first three days of the truce, 39 Israeli hostages were freed by the armed group in exchange for 117 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails as part of the deal between the two sides.
As a result of parallel negotiations led by the Gulf state, 17 Thais, one Filipino and one dual Russian-Israeli national have also been released by Hamas.
Hamas fighters seized around 240 hostages when they stormed from Gaza into southern Israel on October 7 and killed more than 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials.
Afte the attack, Israel launched a relentless bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza, killing more than 15,000 people, including more than 5,000 children, according to Palestinian officials.
Reporting from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Al Jazeera's Nida Ibrahim said families across the occupied Palestinian territories were relieved by the extension.
"This is a source of relief for many families, not just the families of prisoners, but also other people in the occupied West Bank who are watching in horror images coming out of the besieged Gaza Strip.
"We are not just referring to the killings and children who've lost their lives, but also to the people who have been displaced, to the wounded, to the many hunger and in a very difficult situation.
"We are also talking about families of prisoners. So far we do not have a list," she adding that accordingto a Hamas official, it will see the release of at least four more Palestinian prisoners."

More than 200 Palestinians, nearly 30 Israelis killed so far this year: UN

August 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
More than 200 Palestinians and nearly 30 Israelis have been killed so far this year in the occupied West Bank and Israel - a level of violence surpassing last year's entire death toll and the highest number of fatalities since 2005, the United Nations Middle East envoy has said.
Tor Wennesland, UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, told the UN Security Council on Monday that   is being fuelled by growing despair about the future among Palestinians and a lack of progress towards achieving an independent state.
'Palestinians and Israelis are killed and injured in near-daily violence - including just hours before this briefing when another fatal shooting attack killed an Israeli in the West Bank,' he told the Security Council, speaking from Jerusalem.
"The lack of progress towards a political horizon that addressed the core issues driving the conflict has left a dangerous and volatile vacuum,  ," Wennesland told the Security Council.
While Israelis and Palestinians have taken some actions towards stabilising the current situation, Wennesland said unilateral steps have 
He pointed to the unabated expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, Israel's demolition of Palestinian homes, operations by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank areas under Palestinian administrative and police control, and attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian villages.
Wennesland also cited Palestinian "militant activity", and he said that the current situation is compounded by "the fragility" of the Palestinian Authority's financial situation as well as severe funding shortages faced by UN agencies including the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
"While we must urgently focus on addressing the most critical issues and on de-escalating the situation on the ground, we cannot ignore the need to restore a political horizon," he said.
'The Council members were clear today that the violence must stop. I urge leaders to act now to calm the situation. This spiral of violence is leading nowhere but to more bloodshed,' Wennesland said on social media.
2/ The Council members were clear today that the violence must stop. I urge leaders to act now to calm the situation. This spiral of violence is leading nowhere but to more bloodshed. #Israel #Palestine
- Tor Wennesland (@TWennesland) August 21, 2023
 
United States Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield, who chaired the meeting on Monday, called for immediate steps to reduce the escalating violence and reiterated her government's support for a two-state solution.
Russia's deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy told the council that long-term stagnation of the peace process was "compounded by the ongoing illegal unilateral actions of Israel to create irreversible facts on the ground', and described the "unprecedented pace" of Israel's illegal settlement expansion as a huge threat.
France's UN political coordinator Isis Jaraud-Darnault also condemned "the Israeli colonisation of the Palestinian territories" that Palestinians want for their future state, and the continuing Israeli demolitions of Palestinian homes and infrastructure, including a school in the occupied West Bank's Ramallah region on August 17 and which was financed by European donors including France.
Darnault, who also condemned violence against Israelis, told the council that the UN and regional actors have an essential role to play in restoring "a credible political horizon" as a step towards ending the violence.
"The normalisation of relations between Israel and several states in the region contributes to stability and security,' she said.
'But this dynamic will remain incomplete as long as it is not accompanied by a resumption of the political process towards a solution that meets the legitimate aspirations of both Palestinians and Israelis."

'Freedom convoy' to US military base in Turkey calls for Gaza ceasefire

Istanbul, Turkey — A "freedom convoy for Palestine" is on its way from Istanbul to a United States military base in southern Turkey in solidarity with the people of Gaza as Israel wages war on the besieged enclave.
Cars and vans displaying Palestinian and some Turkish flags departed from Istanbul's Ataturk Olympic Stadium on Friday morning and headed to the city of Adana, where the Incirlik Air Base is located.
The Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH), the Turkish non-profit that organised the event, said hundreds of vehicles were driving towards Turkey's capital, Ankara, on Friday afternoon with many more protesters expected to join as the convoy stops in cities along the way, covering nearly 1,000km (620 miles).
Convoys departing from three other Turkish cities - Kahramanmaras, Kayseri and Van - were also expected on Sunday to reach Adana, where the demonstrators plan to encircle the Incirlik Air Base to protest against US support for Israel and to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
The US and Turkish air forces are the primary users of the airbase, which has been used to fly combat missions over Iraq during the first Gulf War and launch air strikes on Afghanistan. The base has also been used by the US-led coalition fighting ISIL (ISIS).

A white bus with a banner that read "Freedom convoy for Palestine" stood out among dozens of vehicles that set off from Istanbul, joined by local pro-Palestine groups and some international activists.
Protesters, including families with children, gathered in a large parking lot where they held placards with slogans such as "We are all Palestinian" and "You can't be silent."
'People were very enthusiastic to go to the American airbase," Mary Annette Wright, a 77-year-old retired US army colonel and former US diplomat who was at the demonstration, told Al Jazeera.
Turkey has taken a firm position critical of Israel's actions. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan   in late October over what he described as an "inhumane" war on Gaza. Addressing a large   last week, Erdogan also called Israel an "occupier".
Wright, who resigned from her post over the war in Iraq in 2003, is part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, a solidarity movement that has launched several campaigns to raise awareness and challenge Israel's blockade of Gaza, which has now lasted more than 16 years and has been tightened into a 'total siege' since the war began on October 7, meaning Israel has stopped deliveries of food, fuel, water and medical supplies.
'[There are] people from Canada, Norway, Sweden, the UK, Spain, Italy, Malaysia, South Africa [in the convoy headed to Adana],' Wright said.
'We are heartbroken'
The NGO behind the convoy is one of the main organisers of the 2010 'Gaza freedom flotilla', an attempt by six civilian ships, including the flagship Mavi Marmara, to break Israel's blockade and bring aid into Gaza.
Ten activists died in an Israeli raid on the Mavi Marmara, which carried mostly Turks, causing a rift in Turkey-Israel relations that the two sides had only recently started to mend.
"In 2018, I was responsible for a ship from Norway to Palestine,' said  Norwegian sociologist Gerd von der Lippe, who joined the convoy, referring to another flotilla that headed to Gaza that year.
'At that time, I stayed in an Israeli prison alongside 22 other people. I am happy and proud to be a part of the work done for Gaza.'

'Anyone who has some humanity should join this convoy,' Mustafa Ozbek, a spokesperson for the IHH, told Al Jazeera as the convoy made its way to Ankara.
'We're driving down the highway right now, and we expect to be joined by more people in Ankara,' he added. 'People from different countries have joined as well.'
People in Turkey have been protesting in large numbers against the war in Gaza since it began.
The war has so far killed more than 9,000 Palestinians as Israel conducts a continuous air bombardment on the enclave and pushes forward with a ground assault in the northern part of Gaza.   have died in Gaza since the war began than in all conflicts around the world in each of the past four years, according to the charity Save the Children. More than 1,400 people in Israel have lost their lives, mostly in October 7 attacks by Hamas on southern Israel, which began the war.
'We are heartbroken because of what is happening in Gaza,' protester Yusuf Gungor said. 'Our brothers and sisters need to know that they are not alone.'

What is Hezbollah? A look at the Lebanese armed group backing Hamas

October 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The deadly skirmishes on Israel's northern border with Lebanon have raised the prospect of a broader conflict in the Middle East, as the Hezbollah armed group has fired artillery and rockets in solidarity with Palestinians.
As Israel pummels the Gaza Strip with air strikes in the wake of   armed group, fear of another front in the north is growing with an  . On Monday, the Iran-backed group   after three of its members were killed in Israeli bombardments.
Here is what we know about Hezbollah:
What is Hezbollah?
Hezbollah, meaning 'Party of God', is an Iran-backed Shia armed and political group that was formed in 1985 to fight Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon.
It emerged from the armed groups formed by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in the wake of Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. The group, which finds its support among Shia Muslims, is one of Israel's biggest foes in the region.
In 2021, leader Hassan Nasrallah claimed Hezbollah had 100,000 fighters. The group boasts precision rockets and says it can hit all parts of Israel.
The United States estimates Iran has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars annually to Hezbollah in recent years.
The group, headed by Nasrallah since 1992, is one of the most influential political blocs in Lebanon's sectarian political system, commanding the support of a large section of the Shia population. The group is often dubbed "a state within a state" due to its vast network of political and military set up in a country divided along sectarian lines.
Why was Hezbollah formed and what are its aims?
Hezbollah's fighters carried on a sustained campaign against Israeli forces in Lebanon and launched attacks on Israeli civilians in other countries.
Israeli forces withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon in 2000 after nearly 20 years of deadly fighting, prompting Hezbollah to proclaim itself the first Arab army ever to force Israel to cede control of territory.
Israel continues to occupy Syria's Golan Heights and Palestinian territories it captured in the 1967 War. Hamas has been fighting against Israeli occupation and the expansion of illegal settlements on Palestinian lands.
Hezbollah released its manifesto  after its formation, highlighting its ideology and objectives, which included defeating Israel and expelling Western colonialist entities from the Middle East.
Has Hezbollah clashed with Israel before?
In a cross-border raid in July 2006, Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers, which it hoped would secure a prisoner swap deal with their Israeli counterparts. Israel responded militarily, resulting in a 34-day war also called the July War.
The conflict ended inconclusively as neither side was able to prevail militarily, but it resulted in the killing of more than 1,100 Lebanese and 165 Israelis .
But Nasrallah has said on multiple occasions that the 2006 war was a success for Hezbollah, noting it withstood Israel's larger and stronger forces.
An Israeli government inquiry   that the 2006 war was an unsuccessful and 'missed opportunity.'
How is Hezbollah different from Hamas?
Hezbollah and Hamas are separate entities but share the common objective of armed resistance against Israel.
While Hezbollah is a Lebanese organisation, Hamas is a Palestinian group that was formed in Gaza in 1987 after the beginning of the first Intifada, an uprising against Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. Hamas politically controls the Gaza Strip after winning elections in 2006.
After Saturday's Hamas attack on Israel, Hezbollah released a   saying it was closely following the situation and was in direct contact with the leadership of the Palestinian resistance.
The statement added it was a 'decisive response to Israel's continued occupation and a message to  ", referring to the Arab countries seeking to normalise ties with Israel.
Leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas also met in   to discuss the normalisation of the relationship between Israel and Arab countries.
Will Israel fight a war on two fronts?
Three members of Hezbollah   during an Israeli bombardment on Monday after a cross-border raid claimed by the   armed group.
Hezbollah said that those killed had been 'martyred as a result of the Zionist aggression in south Lebanon. As a response, the group fired a barrage of rockets into Israel.
Analysts   that Palestinian factions in Lebanon are eager to open a second front if Hezbollah initiates an attack.
Hence, it is possible that Lebanon could become involved in an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, backed by Palestinian factions.
While Hezbollah fired artillery in an Israeli-controlled area claimed by Lebanon on Sunday, the group has avoided deeper participation so far. This could change if Israel were to launch a ground offensive in Gaza, some  .
What are the other Palestinian groups in Lebanon?
Palestinian groups in Lebanon include Hamas, the secular party Fatah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).
Some of these members are based in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon including Ein el-Hilweh and Burj al-Barajneh.
Is Hezbollah a 'terrorist' organisation?
The United States and other Western countries consider Hezbollah a "terrorist organisation". US-allied Gulf states including Saudi Arabia also consider the group to be a "terrorist" group.
The European Union classifies Hezbollah's military wing as a "terrorist group", but not its political wing.
What is the group's role in Lebanon?
Hezbollah has ministers in government and lawmakers in parliament.
Parties in Lebanon who oppose the group accuse it of driving Lebanon into conflict.
The group became more politically prominent after Syria, Hezbollah's close ally, withdrew from Lebanon following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005.
Hariri, a Sunni politician, symbolised Saudi influence in Lebanese politics.
In 2016, the Hezbollah-endorsed Christian politician   became president. Two years later, Hezbollah and its allies won a majority in the country's first general election in nine years.
In the 2022 elections, Hezbollah's political bloc lost its majority but the group continues to hold sway in the country's politics.

Q&A: Australian senator Mehreen Faruqi says she won't 'shut up' on Gaza

November 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Australian senator Mehreen Faruqi has been leading protests in the national parliament calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict.
As deputy leader of the Australian Greens, Faruqi says that she is bringing the "peoples' protests into parliament".
With 11 senators, the Greens form part of the cross-bench in Australia's upper house but the party's calls for a ceasefire have been opposed by Australia's centre-left Labor government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
Albanese's government has made little change to its position since   from a United Nations General Assembly vote calling for a humanitarian truce last month.
Al Jazeera spoke to Faruqi about support for a ceasefire in Australia and what potential she sees for a change in the Australian government's position.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Al Jazeera: The Greens have called for a ceasefire vote in the Australian Senate. What is currently preventing a vote from happening?
Mehreen Faruqi: The Greens did push for a vote in the Senate calling for a ceasefire but both the Labor government and the Liberal-National opposition joined up to oppose it. This shows how blatantly they are ignoring the atrocities committed in Gaza.
The morally bankrupt major parties would like us to remain silent so their cowardice is not exposed. But the Australian Greens and I will not shut up and sit quietly in parliament while the government comes up with pathetic spin on serious questions about justice for Palestine.
Al Jazeera: You and your Greens colleagues have held protests in the Australian Senate, include a boycott of question time - what led you to take these actions?
Mehreen Faruqi: I proudly led the Greens protest in the Senate calling for a ceasefire and boycotting question time. I know we speak for so many in the community.
Today, the @Greens  proudly brought the people's protest into Parliament as we boycotted Question Time after Labor refused to call for a ceasefire yet again.
Like millions of Australians, we're shocked, horrified & angered by Israel's massacre of almost 10,000 people in Gaza. pic.twitter.com/eJPZcoXndN
- Mehreen Faruqi (@MehreenFaruqi) November 6, 2023
I will unapologetically continue to use my parliamentary platform to call for a ceasefire, an end to the occupation of Palestine and for Palestinians' right to self-determination.
To me, there is no point in being here in Parliament if we remain silent in times of such grave injustice. We must get louder and louder.
Al Jazeera: Do you think that the Australian government's position on a humanitarian truce is reflective of the Australian people?
Mehreen Faruqi: Not joining a vast   in calling for a truce was an utterly disgraceful and shameful position for the Australian government to take.
Calling for a   is the absolute bare minimum and they can't even do that.
Tens of thousands of people have   every weekend since the attacks on Gaza began, demanding peace in the region and demanding the Australian government call on Israel for a ceasefire.

The decision to ignore thousands upon thousands of Palestinian and allied voices shows the Australian government's complete disregard for the very people who put faith in them when they elected them.
People will not forget this betrayal. History will not look back kindly on the actions of the government.
Al Jazeera: To what extent is the Australian government involved in Israel's war in Gaza? Is it possible that members of the Australian government could potentially be held liable for this involvement?
Mehreen Faruqi: Australia has one of the most   in the world, but we know hundreds of military shipments have been exported to Israel over the last few years.
As far as I am concerned, our country has a hand in the bloody massacre of   people and counting.
Israel is committing   and subjecting Palestinians to  . The Australian government should immediately stop military exports to Israel.
But more importantly, Australia is one of a small group of Western countries that continue to shield Israel from any accountability, not just over this invasion of Gaza but the entire   of the occupation of Palestine.
It is no surprise that Israel behaves so monstrously when it knows governments of countries like Australia will back them, no matter how brutal and oppressive they are.
Al Jazeera: The Greens hold 11 seats in the Australian Senate. What can the Greens do from this position in regards to Australia's participation in this conflict?
Mehreen Faruqi: The Greens are bringing the voices of the majority of people calling for justice and peace in Australia into parliament. This is powerful in many ways. It shows the community there is someone in the highest office in the country who hears them and has the guts to take a principled stand. They know someone is with them. It also keeps the pressure on the government to call for a ceasefire and an end to Israel's illegal occupation of Palestine.
Like millions of people around the world, I am horrified by the lack of accountability for Israel. Not calling for a ceasefire while   are being massacred in Gaza is heartless and shameful. Our government might be complicit but people are on the side of justice for Palestine.
I'm marching shoulder to shoulder with tens of thousands of people on the streets across Australia and speaking at these protests.
It was time to bring these peoples' protests into parliament so the government would be forced to respond to their calls one way or another.

BRICS condemns Israel war on Gaza in signal to the West

November 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Leaders of major emerging economies called  for an end to Israel's war on Gaza on Tuesday, and for a cessation of hostilities on both sides to ease the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.
In a virtual summit chaired by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, the BRICS grouping denounced attacks on civilians in Palestine and Israel, calling them 'war crimes.'
'We condemned any kind of individual or mass forcible transfer and deportation of Palestinians from their own land,' a chair's summary read. The group, which did not issue a joint declaration, also 'reiterated that the forced transfer and deportation of Palestinians, whether inside Gaza or to neighbouring countries, constitute grave breaches of the Geneva conventions and war crimes and violations under International Humanitarian Law.'
The BRICS is made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, all major emerging economies looking for a greater say in a global order long dominated by theUnited States and its Western allies. These countries are often viewed as leaders of what is referred to in international policy speak as the "Global South".
But it wasn't just these five countries that spoke on the war on Tuesday. Earlier this year, the BRICS had   and add Egypt, Ethiopia, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iran as members from 2024. The leaders of these six countries also participated in the meeting called by South Africa. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres joined the summit too.
The chair's summary — in essence a gist of the mood in the room — highlights growing calls from the Global South to end the war on the Gaza Strip. The conflict began after an October 7 attack on Israeli communities by the armed group Hamas that saw 1,200 people killed and 240 others taken hostage. In response, Israel has incessantly shelled Gaza, targeting hospitals, schools and refugee camps and killing more than 13,000 people, many of them children, in violation of international laws.
Since then, millions of people across Africa, Asia and the Middle East have marched for a 'Free Palestine' and called for a ceasefire. Experts in Africa and elsewhere have accused the United States, United Kingdom and European Union of hypocrisy for claiming to be bastions of democracy and human rights while supporting Israel's war in Gaza.
A 'growing assertiveness'
While the chair's summary appeared 'mild and somewhat balanced' according to Steven Gruzd, an analyst at the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA), some countries were more combative in their presentations.
In his opening statement at the meeting, the current BRICS chair, President Ramaphosa of South Africa, said that Israel's actions 'are in clear violation of international law' and that the 'collective punishment of Palestinian civilians by Israel 'is a war crime … tantamount to genocide'. Ramaphosa also said Hamas had 'violated international law and must be held accountable'.
India's stance was comparatively softer, with Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar saying there was 'a need for restraint and immediate humanitarian support', as well as 'peaceful resolution through dialogue and diplomacy'.
Many of the member states, including Russia and Brazil, have previously criticised Israel's non-stop bombardment and now, ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. China, for its part, this week  , officials and organisations seeking a ceasefire, including the Palestinian Authority (PA).
India, though, has not been as vocal and has in fact   on pro-Palestine marches at home, seemingly siding with Israel and its biggest benefactor, the US, in what is seen as a split within the BRICS itself.
But that split did not seem glaring at Tuesday's summit, which experts say is a first-of-its-kind meeting for a group that has previously focused on economic issues.
'I am not sure I recall a similar extraordinary summit being called,' Gruzd told Al Jazeera. 'It does reflect on the growing assertiveness and confidence of the BRICS grouping, not waiting for the West. BRICS has generally shied away from political and security issues; this meeting goes against that trend.'
Together, BRICS countries represent 40 percent of the world population and a quarter of the global economy.
President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran – Israel's archenemy – said Palestinians should hold a referendum  to determine their fate.
Still, many BRICS nations — not just India — have established ties with Israel that they will be wary of severing.
China has huge investments in Israel, Gruzd notes, while India has even deeper historic ties with the country and enjoys military and technological partnerships with it. But with a fiery Iran set to join the group, India might not be able to influence how a new BRICS+ will react to Israel, Gruzd said.
South Africa, currently the smallest BRICS country, and one that itself experienced oppressive apartheid rule for more than four decades, sees its own struggle reflected in that of the Palestinians and has consistently been one of the loudest calls for a ceasefire, said analysts.
At the same time, it has long been Israel's largest trade partner in Africa. On Tuesday, that relationship appeared to have reached a turning point.
Parliament members voted to shut down the Israeli embassy in Pretoria, signifying a turning point in the crisis. Diplomats from the country had already been recalled from Israel on November 6. Israel recalled its ambassador to South Africa, Eliav Belotserkovsky, for 'consultations' on Monday in response to Pretoria's growing hostility.
Alongside Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros and Djibouti last week, South Africa also submitted a referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate whether war crimes have been committed in Gaza.
A turning point?
On Monday, South African Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni applied further pressure, calling for an ICC warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, adding that it would be a 'total failure' if the court did not investigate the leader.
Earlier this year, South Africa had managed to   Russia not to send President Vladimir Putin to the annual BRICS Summit in August because of an ICC arrest warrant issued against him for war crimes committed in Ukraine. If Putin had attended the summit in South Africa, the country, an ICC signatory, would have been obligated to arrest him.
Tuesday's BRICS stance, instigated by South Africa, might push more countries to be vocal in denouncing the war, said Muhammed Desai of Africa4Palestine, an advocacy group.
'South Africa is a significant economic and political powerhouse on the African continent as well as a country with one of the most embassies and high commissions in the world,' Desai said. 'Thus, its stance and position does have clout within the diplomatic arena.'
But the coalition's political weight is not significant enough to have any real impact on the direction of Israel's war, others say. 'Frankly, I do not think they have much leverage on Israel directly,' said Gruzd of SAIIA. 'I also do not think it will have much effect on the West, besides adding to voices calling for a ceasefire.'
Their leverage is, however, growing. Dozens of nations have applied or shown interest in joining BRICS, a major reason for the expansion earlier this year, as countries seek to reduce their dependence on the US-led Western financial system.
Russia, which will hold the group's presidency in 2024, is expected to push to use local currencies for international trade payments, as opposed to the dominant US dollar.
That platform, some say, is necessary for the voice of the Global South to be heard. 'Within the global world order, BRICS offers another voice,' Desai of Africa4Palestine said, and 'that is necessary to counter the current Western hegemonic view'.

Lebanon warns army may intervene if Palestinian faction clashes continue

August 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati has threatened to send in the Lebanese army to the country's largest Palestinian refugee camp, where   has killed more than a dozen people, wounded many more and displaced thousands.
In a phone call, Mikati urged the President of the Palestinian Authority (PA) Mahmoud Abbas to ensure   at the Ein el-Hilweh camp cease.
Mikati called the clashes a 'flagrant violation of Lebanese sovereignty' and said that it was unacceptable for the groups to 'terrorise the Lebanese, especially the people of the south who have embraced the Palestinians for many years', according to a statement released by his office.
The fighting near the southern port city of Sidon has been going on since Sunday, but there was some calm on Thursday.
Abbas's Fatah party has accused the armed groups Jund al-Sham and Shabab al-Muslim of gunning down a Fatah military general, Abu Ashraf al-Armoushi, in the camp.
People have fled to nearby mosques and schools to escape the violence.
'We are tired of all of this,' said Mohamed Sabakh, an Ein el-Hilweh resident staying in one such mosque with his family. 'We have children.'
Even outside the camp, stores and roads are closed, trapping people, Sabakh also said.
Dorothee Klaus, director of the United Nations refugee agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, in Lebanon said Thursday that 600 people displaced from the camp are staying in two of the agency's schools, in Sidon and in another nearby camp, Mieh Mieh.
'We have not been able to enter the camp and deliver much-needed assistance,' she said, adding that nearly 360 of UNRWA's staff live there, some still trapped and one injured in the clashes.
A ceasefire agreement reached Monday was broken by the armed groups when they attacked one of Fatah's centres in the camp, part of a 'project to destroy the camp and transform the camp into a camp of militants, possibly a camp of terrorists', said Maher Shabaita, head of Fatah in the Sidon region.
Palestinian factions in Ein el-Hilweh have formed an investigative committee to figure out who was responsible for al-Armoushi's killing, and will hand them over to the Lebanese judiciary for trial, he said.
Ein el-Hilweh is one of 12 camps established in Lebanon in 1948 for Palestinian refugees after Israel was created.
Following a 1969 agreement between Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Lebanese army largely avoids entering the camps, but some Lebanese officials have called for the army to take control of them in the wake of the recent clashes.
Ein el-Hilweh, home to about 50,000 people, has seen many bouts of violence over the decades, both interfactional fighting, as well as between Palestinian factions and Lebanese forces.

Glasgow, Scotland – The atmosphere at Celtic Park on European nights needs few added extras, the electricity in the air on such occasions is enough to light up the Glasgow skyline several times over.
But as 60,000 Celtic fans flocked to the famous arena last Wednesday evening for the Champions League tie against Atletico Madrid, it was not just anticipation for the game powering the pre-match energy.
As kickoff neared, the stadium transformed into a  , every stand awash with the colours of Palestine in a show of solidarity with those in Gaza under  .
A few days before, when Celtic fans displayed Palestinian flags at a domestic away fixture, television networks were accused of purposefully avoiding the display. They had no such option this time. The display was beamed around the world, and quickly shared millions of times on social media.
The main flag bearers, literally and figuratively, are   – an "ultras" group formed in 2006, renowned for their Irish Republicanism and unflinching support for the Palestinian cause.
It's a position that has attracted many admirers but often puts them at  , which is more politically conservative than the fanbase.
Fearful of penalties from football's governing bodies, the club urged fans not to heed the Green Brigade's call to show support for Palestine at the Atletico Madrid game, releasing a statement asking 'that banners, flags and symbols relating to the conflict and those countries involved in it are not displayed at Celtic Park at this time'.
A few days prior to the match, in an apparent warning to the group, Celtic banned the Green Brigade from all away games. Following the display against Atletico Madrid, that ban has been extended to all home games.
In a letter to fans, the club outlined several reasons for the ban, including anti-social behaviour, the use of pyrotechnics and crucially 'against Atletico Madrid, another unauthorised display, breaching the restrictions previously communicated'.
For the Green Brigade, there's little doubt that it was the Palestine display which has led to the ban.
'The other issues are a smokescreen,' the Green Brigade told Al Jazeera. 'The club are very clever and cynical. They want to sanction us, they want to punish us. They want to send us a message to try to keep us in line and deter us from doing further action.
But they know very well that on the issue of Palestine, they're not on strong ground as they don't have a lot of support amongst the wider fanbase on that issue. So they're using other issues that they think they will have support on to sanction us.'
The Green Brigade also told Al Jazeera that senior Celtic officials had previously told them privately that they were most concerned with "their corporate image and corporate responsibilities" to shareholders.
"But we're unashamed of and unequivocal of our support for Palestine and that will continue," the group said.
'And once again the wider Celtic support showed that they too had the courage and conviction to stand and be counted. To side with the right side of history and voice support for the underdog, which in this case is the Palestinians."
The club did not respond to Al Jazeera's requests for comment.
'They give us hope we're not alone'
For those familiar with Celtic's origin story, as a club born from the Irish Catholic diaspora in Scotland, the fans' solidarity with the assault on Gaza was no surprise. Support for left-wing, anti-imperialist causes among the fanbase is common.
Banning the Green Brigades is a risky escalation by the club, as the group are popular among the wider Celtic support.
Indeed, flags supporting Palestine at Celtic Park predate the group's formation. Both the shareholders group The Celtic Trust and fellow ultras group Bhoys Celtic have condemned the ban, with the latter staging a walkout in protest at the recent game against St Mirren.
'There will be no return to normality from us while this absurd and entirely avoidable situation is allowed to continue,' the group said in a statement, suggesting that further walkouts or boycotts could take place.
With the ban on the 300 or so supporters being indefinite "pending further review", the situation leaves Celtic a club at civil war at a crucial time in the season.
Some fans believe their political displays canoccasionallygo too far, but all agreethat their absence will negatively impact the atmosphere at games.
There is also precedent for Celtic fans uniting on the  . When the Green Brigade showed support for Palestine in a tie against the Israeli club Hapoel Be'er Sheva in 2016, the club were fined by UEFA for the display of "illicit banners".
The wider fanbase swung behind a fundraising campaign; not to pay the fine, but to support charities in Palestine.
More than 175,000 pounds ($214,000) was raised, which helped to fund the formation of Aida Celtic, a football team in Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem, the occupied West Bank. The links established then have solidified in the seven years since, with regular exchange visits made as part of a deepening of fans' education of the Palestine issue.
Indeed, while the Celtic board may have shifted uncomfortably in their seats as they saw the Palestinian flags unfurled last Wednesday, the intended recipients of the gesture, the people of Gaza, welcomed it warmly.
"We thank Celtic fans for this stand and for their ongoing solidarity to the Palestinian people in Gaza," Hazem Tabash, the manager of the Benn'a Sports Club in Gaza told Al Jazeera, who saw the images online despite Israel's communication blackouts and widespread bombing in the besieged territory.
The Benn'a youth centre's footballers have played previously in green and white hoops of Celtic.
But its pitch currently lies desolate, if not destroyed. Located near the border fence in the eastern Gaza Strip, all staff and volunteers were forced to flee when the Israeli bombing started on October 7, after   in Israel that killed 1,405 people, most of whom were Israeli civilians.
Israel's retaliatory attacks have killed at  , including 3,760 children.
'[The fans'] actions are important to raise awareness of the public in Western countries where governments give Israel full support to continue its crimes against Palestinians in Gaza,' Tabash said of the display at Celtic Park. 'They also help to support us Palestinians on the ground, giving us some hope that we are not alone.
'I call for all fans who believe in justice and freedom to follow the steps of Celtic fans and ask your governments to act immediately to stop this genocide and stop the double standards and the bias when it comes to the Palestine-Israel conflict.'
Accusations of double standards relate not just to how governments are acting on this matter, but also to football authorities. There was widespread support for Ukraine in the footballing world when it was invaded by Russia last year. Indeed, Russian clubs were even banned from European competition.
But a very different approach is taken to any display of support for Palestinians.
'Why are the football authorities uncomfortable with football fans expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people?' said David Webber, a senior research fellow at Solent University specialising in football and politics.
'UEFA and FIFA were quite quick to exclude Russia from international competition and club competition. But we don't see that same treatment of Israel. Does it really just boil down to the fact the Palestinians are brown and not white?'
'It's all part of trying to neutralise football as a product but what that does is it starves the game of its authenticity. The values that the fans have matter and are inextricable to the clubs they support. However much the clubs might want to expunge it, these values are not just left at the turnstile.'
The Green Brigade, meanwhile, told Al Jazeera they intend to stick to their motto: Until The Last Rebel.
"The political class like to tell working-class people that they don't know what they're talking about or that they can't have an opinion on certain issues," they said.
"We're a proudly politically conscious group. We won't be dictated to by anyone."

'Never seen such atrocities': Palestinian reporters recount war horrors

At least 30 journalists have been killed in the latest Palestinian-Israeli round of violence that began on October 7, the Committee to Protect Journalists has said . These journalists include 25 Palestinians, four Israelis, and one Lebanese.
In response to Hamas's attack on Israel, in which more than 1,400 people died, Israel has been staging almost-continuous raids on Gaza that have so far claimed the lives of over 8,000 people, more than 3,000 of whom are children.
Those reporting from Gaza continue to carry out their jobs while facing what Amnesty International describes  as 'war crimes' of collective punishment and indiscriminate attacks. But in the West Bank, Gaza and beyond, Palestinian journalists speak of unprecedented physical, emotional and mental strains. They are navigating the tricky grounds of professional reporting while facing intensified censorship, and what they say is deliberate  Israeli gunfire.
Al Jazeera spoke to a number of Palestinian journalists in Gaza, the West Bank and beyond.
Majd Said, Abu Dhabi TV anchor, West Bank
'I'm one of the journalists who covered the Al-Aqsa Intifada (the second Intifada from 2000-2005). It was cruel and difficult back then, but it's nothing like what we're witnessing now.
The level of oppression we experience both as citizens and journalists is unmatched — oppressed because of the feelings of helplessness on all fronts, politically, on the ground and on the human level. We are unable to offer anything to our people in Gaza.
It's true that I vent when I speak on air, but the amount of destruction, killing, and displacement is nothing we have ever experienced before. I witnessed the first Intifada and was a journalist covering the second Intifada, but never have I seen such atrocities.
And the rest of the world is in lockstep in its opposition to the Palestinian cause — the governments are opposed to Palestine politically. There is popular sympathy for the Palestinian cause, but the people seemingly have no impact on their governments. Only God knows which direction their schemes will take us.'
Aseel Mafarjeh, freelance reporter, West Bank
'These are exceptionally difficult times for Palestinian journalists in the West Bank. The loss of their colleagues has hampered their creativity, but they are still determined to expose the crimes of the occupation. Seeing a colleague lose a family member who is martyred has made journalists fearful because this situation will go on for a long time.
I saw hard things in the field. How does a mother bury her martyred son with a smile? Where does she get that strength? In these moments, I break into tears. I am conflicted because I am supposed to be strong, but at that moment I am the one who needs to be consoled. Interviewing the families of martyrs after their burial is more difficult than the funeral itself. This is when his family remembers all the good things about him. Some wish they had died in their place, while others remain steadfast. You can never forget what a mother or father say about their martyred son.
Journalists are also victims of the crimes of the occupation, like Shireen Abu Akleh and many Palestinian colleagues. The exhaustion, despair, frustration, panic, and grief that journalists experience every day makes them set limits on all their plans. Everyone has a family they worry about. But for how long?
How does a journalist live in Palestine? He is dejected, suffering from the horrors of the scene. He cannot rebel to protect his family, whose movement may be paralysed by the occupation. He could die in an instant while covering the violence.
How long can we endure this? Can we continue on this path? I think the majority would say no.'
Mosab Shawer, freelance photojournalist, Hebron, West Bank
'Since October 7, it's been even more difficult for journalists to get around the occupied territories. Reporting on some developments has become very challenging as a result of police deployment and settlers riled up against the Arab press.
In all my 15 years of reporting, never did I feel this much helplessness and fear. We watched along with the world, as mothers mourned their children who were murdered, their dreams cut short – way too short.'
Mohammed J Abu Safia, freelance journalist and photographer, Gaza
'I am scared the most at my helplessness to protect my family. Where do we go? There is no place that we did not escape to. We moved so many times already. I have my family split between three different homes, so we don't die together. Surviving this would enable us to speak of the injustice that has befallen us.
What I see in my tours of hospitals is beyond my ability to describe. I take photos because they can convey what my words fail at doing when it comes to what is happening in Gaza. It's a massacre. Children burned, pregnant women targeted. Even when the Israeli army warned people to evacuate, they still bombed the road they designated as safe.'
Mahmoud Zoghbor, Palestinian freelance journalist in Cairo
'I left for Cairo six months ago in search of career advancement, but what I'm experiencing now are pangs of guilt, remorse, and helplessness over what is happening in Gaza. I call colleagues and friends there and they think they're the next victim. I'm also unable to help spread the word and report properly from here because communication channels are being targeted.
In the first week of the war, my mind was still in a state of shock and unable to comprehend the huge amount of shocking news resulting from the bombing and displacement of civilians. But little by little, I began to feel psychological isolation and great fear as a result of the lack of communication and the absence of a permanent means to help calm anxiety and reassure me. Over the last few days, I've been having nightmares, great difficulties getting sleep or concentrating, and reorganising my thoughts. While I am still following up on the stories I am preparing with sources in Gaza, time is spent waiting for a possible opportunity to communicate without interference, as well as anticipating more sad news about the Israeli bombing that struck most of the vital parts of Gaza.
I am very familiar with war because I experienced it many times, but the scale of this indicates that the population is exposed to widespread collective punishment.
Although I worked in newsrooms during previous bombing rounds on Gaza, what is documented by friends and activists on social media platforms from there is harrowing. People in Gaza are also disappearing from all means of communication, and the news media have become almost the only source for checking on the safety of everyone living inside Gaza.'
These testimonials were compiled by Egab .

Israel says truce, captives release will not start 'before Friday'

A temporary truce and the release of dozens of captives taken by Palestinian armed group Hamas in its assault on Israel on October 7 will not start before Friday, Tel Aviv has said, as Israeli forces continued to bombard the besieged enclave of Gaza.
The release is part of a  , initially expected to last four days, that was agreed by Israel and Hamas on Wednesday and also includes the deployment of desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza.
The captives are supposed to be exchanged for a number of Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
"The negotiations on the release of our hostages are advancing and continuing constantly," Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said in a statement released by the prime minister's office.
"The start of the release will take place according to the original agreement between the sides, and not before Friday," it said.
Israel's public broadcaster Kan, quoting an unidentified Israeli official, reported there was a 24-hour delay because the agreement had not been signed by Hamas and Qatar, which was the key mediator in the deal. The official said they were optimistic the agreement would be carried out when it was signed.
"No one said there would be a release tomorrow except the media … We had to make it clear that no release is planned before Friday, because of the uncertainty that hostages' families are facing," Kan quoted an unnamed source in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office as saying.
Other Israeli media published similar reports, quoting anonymous officials, that the pause in fighting with Hamas would not start before Friday.
More than 14,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its   on the territory in response to Hamas's assault on Israel that left at least 1,200 people dead.
About 240 people were taken by Hamas fighters, and only four have been released so far.
There were about 5,200 Palestinians in Israeli prisons prior to October 7, although that number has more than   in the weeks since, according to Palestinian authorities.
Amid the apparent delay to the truce agreement, Israeli aircraft and artillery struck Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis in at least two waves early on Thursday.
In Israel, sirens warning of incoming rocket fire from Gaza blared in communities near the border with the enclave, the military said. There were no reports of damage or injuries.

Tensions also rose on Israel's northern border early on Thursday after the Iran-backed Hezbollah group said five of its fighters, including the son of a senior lawmaker, had been killed.
In the Red Sea, meanwhile, US Central Command said the USS Thomas Hudner had "shot down multiple one-way attack drones launched from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen", referencing another Iran-backed group.
'I want everybody back'
The delay caused frustration among families on both sides.
Under the terms of the agreement, 50 Hamas captives are due to be released, with a minimum of 10 being freed each day.
"We don't know who will get out because Hamas will release the names every evening of those who will get out the next day," said Gilad Korngold, who was still awaiting word of relatives. Seven of his family members, including his three-year-old granddaughter, were kidnapped by Hamas.
"I want everybody back. But I think – and it's a very tough decision – but I think the children and women must be [first]. They are most fragile. You know, they need to get out."
Netanyahu's office has said the   could be extended as long as an additional 10 hostages were freed each day.
On Israel's list of 300 eligible Palestinian prisoners of 123 children and 33 women is Shorouq Dwayyat, who is serving a 16-year sentence for attempted murder in a 2015 knife attack. Campaigners say she is one of many Palestinians to have been unjustly tried and sentenced on unfair or fabricated charges.
"I had hoped that she would come out in a deal," her mother,  , said but added that her relief was tempered by "great pain in my heart" over the dead children in Gaza.
The US also hoped that aid would begin reaching Gaza in large volumes in the coming days, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said.
Hamas   the initial 50 captives would be released in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children imprisoned in Israel. Hundreds of trucks of humanitarian, medical and fuel supplies would enter Gaza, while Israel would halt all air sorties over southern Gaza and maintain a daily six-hour daytime no-fly window in the north, it added.
The truce agreement, the first in a nearly seven-week-long war, was reached after mediation by Qatar and seen by governments around the world as potentially easing the suffering in the Gaza Strip, which is home to more than two million people.
In a statement shared by US media outlets, National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson stressed the deal 'was agreed and remains agreed'.
'The parties are working out final logistical details, particularly for the first day of implementation,' CBS News and CNN reported Watson as saying.
'It is our view that nothing should be left to chance as the hostages begin coming home. Our primary objective is to ensure that they are brought home safely. That is on track, and we are hopeful that implementation will begin on Friday morning.'

Ben-Gvir lashes out at supermodel Bella Hadid over Palestinian rights

August 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel's far-right national security minister has sparred with US supermodel Bella Hadid over comments this week that Palestinians condemned as racist.
In an interview with N12 News on Wednesday, Itamar Ben-Gvir   that the right to life and movement for settlers in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank trumped the right to movement for Palestinians.
Palestinians have long railed against travel restrictions, including checkpoints, imposed on them by Israel in the occupied West Bank, an area where they exercise limited self-rule.
Ben-Gvir, who lives in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba near the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron, said in the interview the curbs were needed to protect his family's security.
"My right, my wife's right, my children's right to travel on the roads of Judea and Samaria is more important than the right to movement for Arabs," he said, referring to the West Bank by its biblical Hebrew name.
Supermodel Bella Hadid, whose father is Palestinian and who has been a  , criticised Ben-Gvir's comment on Instagram, where she has close to 60 million followers.
"In no place, no time, especially in 2023 should one life be more valuable than another's. Especially simply because of their ethnicity, culture or pure hatred," she wrote in a post on Thursday.
She also posted a video from leading Israeli rights group B'Tselem showing Israeli soldiers in Hebron telling a resident that Palestinians are not permitted to walk on a certain street because it is reserved for Jews. "Does this remind anyone of anything?" she wrote.
Ben-Gvir responded in a statement on Friday calling Hadid an "Israel hater" and said she had shared only a segment of the interview on her social media account in order to portray him as a racist.
The Palestinian Ministryof Foreign Affairs on Thursday condemned Ben-Gvir's remark as "racist and heinous" and said it "only confirms Israel's apartheid regime of Jewish supremacy".
The international community, along with the Palestinians, considers settlement construction illegal. More than 700,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem - territories captured by Israel in 1967 and sought by the Palestinian leaders for a future state.
Palestinians in Hebron, where Jewish settlements eat up a significant proportion of the centre of the city, are particularly vulnerable to  as well as Israeli surveillance.
Settler attacks against Palestinians and their property are also a regular occurrence.
Israel has rejected any suggestions that it maintains an apartheid system over Palestinians, despite reports by leading rights organisations – including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International –  .
The West Bank has been rocked by violence since early last year, especially with repeated deadly raids by the army.
According to the United Nations,  have been killed this year, the highest number of fatalities since 2005.
Ben-Gvir, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition, has been convicted in the past of inciting racism and of supporting a terrorist organisation.

US resists ceasefire call in UN Security Council debate on Israel-Gaza war

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United Nations Security Council has held its first open debate on the Israel-Gaza war, with most members calling for an immediate ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid to reach Palestinians under relentless Israeli bombardment in Gaza.
The 15-member council, where the five permanent members including the United States and Russia have a veto, has so far failed to deliver a resolution that would end the violence.
The US, Israel's staunchest ally, last week   backed by 12 other members of the council, which would have called for a pause in fighting, because it did not do enough to stress Israel's right to self-defence.
An earlier Russian-drafted resolution was also rejected.
Nearly 90 countries were on the speakers' list for Tuesday's debate including about 30 foreign ministers and deputy ministers, with many echoing calls for a ceasefire and a halt to attacks on Palestinian civilians amid widespread destruction in Gaza and the  .
"We followed with regret the inability of this council twice to adopt a resolution or even to call for a ceasefire to end this war," said Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry.
Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, speaking on behalf of the 22-member Arab Group at the UN, accused Israel of 'razing Gaza to the ground' and lamented the Security Council's failure to call an immediate ceasefire.

He urged diplomats to adopt a resolution to stop the war, condemn the killing of civilians on both sides and prevent the starvation as well as collective punishment of the Palestinians.
'The Security Council must take a clear stance to reassure 2 billion Arabs and Muslims that international law will be applied,' Safadi said.
Washington, however, has said it favours a humanitarian pause, which is considered less formal and shorter than a ceasefire.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken asked the council to back a new US-led resolution that "incorporates substantive feedback".
The draft, according to the AFP news agency, would defend the "inherent right of all states" to self-defence while calling for compliance with international law. It would back "humanitarian pauses" to let in aid but not a full ceasefire.
The US's top diplomat also stressed the need to protect Palestinian civilians.
'Israel must take all possible precautions to avoid harm to civilians,' he said, and 'humanitarian pauses' must be considered to get aid flowing into Gaza and enable civilians 'to get out of harm's way".
Russia, meanwhile, has put forward its own counter resolution. A vote could take place later this week.
"The whole world is expecting from the Security Council a call for a swift and unconditional ceasefire," said Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia.
Amid the deadlock at the council, Jordan and Russia are among nations that have requested a meeting on Thursday of the UN General Assembly. Resolutions there are non-binding but hugely symbolic.
Inaction is 'inexcusable'
The   erupted nearly three weeks ago after the armed Hamas group attacked several southern Israeli towns killing at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than   as captives.
Israel has since cut off supplies of water, food, fuel and electricity to Gaza, subjecting the territory of 2.3 million people to relentless bombardment. At least 5,791 people have been killed, according to authorities in Gaza, which is ruled by  .
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire.
The grievances of the Palestinian people could not justify 'the horrifying and unprecedented October 7 acts of terror' by Hamas in Israel, he told the council, calling on the group to immediately release all those being held captive.
But Guterres also stressed that 'those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people".
He expressed deep concern at 'the clear violations of international humanitarian law', calling Israel's constant bombardment of Gaza and the level of destruction and civilian casualties 'alarming".
Without naming Hamas, the UN chief also stressed that 'protecting civilians can never mean using them as human shields".
Guterres also criticised Israel without naming it, saying 'protecting civilians does not mean ordering more than 1 million people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself".
And then, in comments that angered Israel, he said that this month's events could not be seen in isolation.
"It is important to recognise that the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum,"  . "The Palestinian people have been subjected to 50 years of suffering."
The remarks triggered fury among the Israeli delegation with Israel's UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan calling for the UN chief's resignation.
Foreign Minister Eli Cohen also criticised the comments. 'There is no cause for this, and shame on him,' he said.
Cohen had earlier sought to defend Israel's bombardment of Gaza, arguing the only proportionate response to the October 7 Hamas attacks was the "total destruction" of the group.
'It is not only Israel's right to destroy Hamas," Cohen said. "It's our duty.'

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki, meanwhile, said that only peace could make Israel safer.
"We are here today to stop the killing, to stop the ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel, the occupying power, against the Palestinian civilian population," he said.
Under international law, he said, 'it is our collective human duty to stop them".
Al-Maliki, who is from the Palestinian Authority, Hamas's rivals, said the inaction by the Security Council was "inexcusable".
Amid the deteriorating humanitarian situation, a limited amount of humanitarian assistance has been allowed into Gaza, with an additional eight trucks carrying water, food and medicine entering the enclave from Egypt late on Tuesday.
UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, warned in a post on the messaging platform X that it would have to halt operations in Gaza on Wednesday night because of the lack of fuel.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said more than a third of hospitals in Gaza and nearly two-thirds of primary health care clinics had shut due to damage or lack of fuel.

'There is zero work': Occupied West Bank paralysed as economy stalls

October 29th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Ramallah, Occupied West Bank - The central bus stop in downtown Ramallah is usually bustling with people and traffic.
But since October 7, the buses have been parked up and the drivers sitting idle, watching the news, smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee to pass the time.
'There is zero work,' 40-year-old driver Saleh Nakhleh told Al Jazeera from the rest stop at the bus station, in the central Israeli-occupied West Bank.
'We are barely making ends meet,' the father-of-four said.
While drivers can usually earn between 350 to 400 shekels ($86 to $98) a day, their daily income has dropped to about 100 shekels ($24), he explained.
Israel's continuing military assault on the besieged Gaza Strip was launched in tandem with intensified army restrictions and Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, leaving the three million Palestinian residents there in a state of paralysis and economic standstill.
Major checkpoints are closed, cafes are empty, the once-overflowing university classrooms are void of students and produce on the shelves of stores is starting to dwindle. Travel between cities and to surrounding villages has become a dangerous and difficult feat.
'We do not leave Ramallah – all the roads are closed and there are checkpoints everywhere. People are afraid, and we cannot take responsibility for anyone's life,' said 35-year-old driver Ali Jamal Taleb.

Taleb described how he was attacked by soldiers when he made a trip to the village of Sinjil some 20km (12 miles) outside Ramallah just under two weeks ago.
'I had two workers from Gaza with me. The soldiers pulled us out of the car and beat us for no reason. They put us up against the wall, tied our arms back and kept beating us. They then left us for two hours on the side of the road, and then let us go,' the father-of-two told Al Jazeera, adding that he believed the soldiers 'want revenge'.
'Sales down by half'
On October 7, Hamas, which governs the besieged Gaza Strip, launched attacks on Israeli territory. More than 1,400 people in Israel were killed.
Israel responded with a relentless bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip that has persisted for three weeks, killing more than 7,700 Palestinians there to date, including more than 3,000 children, while more than 15,200 people have been injured, spurring worldwide protests over what has been described by many observers as a 'genocide'.
In the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, the Israeli army has   on Palestinian neighbourhoods, villages and cities. Killings of residents by armed settlers have also become more frequent, leaving people in a state of fear.
More than 100 Palestinians have been killed by the army and settlers in those areas over the past 21 days.
The tense atmosphere and closures in the occupied West Bank have affected almost all sectors of society.
Ibrahim al-Kilani, 57, runs a large fruit and vegetable store in Beitunia on the outskirts of Ramallah. Usually, he brings all his produce from Nablus and some from inside Israel.
Prior to the recent events, al-Kilani would receive one truckload of produce from Nablus every day. Now, the truck makes one trip every two to three days.
'The economic situation is collapsing,' he told Al Jazeera.
'Sales are down by 50 percent. We are facing great difficulties transporting produce – the trips have become expensive in terms of gas and the time it takes for them to arrive,' al-Kilani said.
Much of the fruit he sold came from Israel, "as well as things like mushrooms, broccoli, celery, lettuce," he said. "All of that is dwindling,' al-Kilani added, pointing to the empty shelves in his store.

'Losing billions of dollars'
The West Bank was in a financial crisis well before the recent events as a result of Israel's 56-year occupation and heavy restrictions on movement.
The United Nations   that the Israeli occupation cost the Palestinian economy some $47.7bn in fiscal revenues between 2000 and 2017.
Since October 7, however, things are only getting worse.
'We used to import almost $2bn-worth of products through the Asdod [Ashdod] port [in Israel],' said Rashad Yousef, head of policy and planning at the Palestinian Authority's (PA) Ministry of National Economy.
'That's gone.'
In addition, the vast majority of the 200,000 Palestinian labourers who work inside Israel and in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, are now jobless.
'We used to make $1.2bn in salaries of labour workers in Israel and in settlements, which would help the economy. That's dropped down severely – only about 5 percent of these labourers are going to work,' Yousef told Al Jazeera.

Yousef added that, before the start of the war, the PA had expected gross domestic product (GDP) for the West Bank to rise by 3 percent in 2023. It now expects GDP to drop by that amount instead.
'Factories are being forced to drop their production capacity because they can't transport their products to other parts of the West Bank.
'We are also facing many difficulties importing and exporting through the border crossing with Jordan,' he added. The PA is particularly concerned about low supplies of basic items, such as vegetable oil, rice, flour and sugar.
'It's clear that the war on Gaza and the accompanying intensified closure of the occupied West Bank will have a long negative effect on the Palestinian economy,' said Yousef.
'The repercussions will continue to be felt in the next few months, and we expect prices to rise.'
Still, drivers, labourers and store owners in the West Bank say that what they are going through is nothing compared with the situation for Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Back at the bus station in Ramallah, Taleb, the driver, said that while he is worried about the future of the West Bank, the situation is still bearable."Look at people in Gaza. At least we still have food and water. Our children are still safe, alive and are playing around us."

They included 37 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese. This makes the period the deadliest for journalists since the CPJ's data collection began in 1992.
About 200,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced southwards since November 5, the United Nations Humanitarian Affairs Office (OCHA) reported.
It was confirmed on Tuesday that Israeli-Canadian peace activist   was killed on October 7. Silver moved from Winnipeg in Canada to Kibbutz Be'eri, near Gaza, in the early 1970s.

All of Gaza's hospitals may shut down in 48 hours, Dr Ashraf al-Qudra, the spokesman for Gaza's Ministry of Health, told Al Jazeera Arabic.
Gaza's government media organisation said in a statement that Israel bears full responsibility for its actions committed against the enclave's hospitals.
The statement also accused the army of spreading lies to destroy the hospitals. Israel had previously claimed without evidence that the hospitals in Gaza are being used by Hamas to hide weapons and keep captives, accusations Hamas has rejected.
Doctors at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis organised a vigil in solidarity with their counterparts at al-Shifa Hospital, which is surrounded by Israeli forces.

Hours after his appointment as Britain's foreign secretary,  spoke to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken about  "the conflict in the Middle East, Israel's right to self-defence and the need for humanitarian pauses to allow the safe passage of aid into Gaza".
Blinken also addressed criticism from the US State Department staff over the Biden administration's support for Israel's war on Gaza. He added that forums are being organised in Washington, DC to hear from department members who disagree with the administration's approach.
As the current chair of the G7 nations and a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Japan needs to do more to prevent atrocities in Palestine and Israel and ensure accountability before the ICC for serious crimes already committed, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a statement  on Monday.
Rabbis and US Congress members alike demanded a ceasefire in Gaza on Monday night as hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists occupied a federal building in California.
Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva welcomed Brazilians and Palestinians who left the Gaza Strip from the Rafah border and entered Brazil on Monday. Lula condemned Israel's "brutality and violence".
Attacks in the West Bank
