Diaspora Palestinians in Greece fear for relatives in Gaza, long for peace

November 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Athens, Greece – Diaspora Palestinians who were uprooted during previous crises fear they may be witnessing the biggest forced displacement in their lifetimes.
'They tell us to go to the south [of Gaza],' said Salma Shawwa, referring to Israel's order to 1.5 million Palestinians living in the northern Gaza Strip to move south last month.
'So slowly, slowly we will go to the border and then to Sinai? Is this the solution? So Gaza will be gone also? And then [the Israelis] will go to the West Bank and Jerusalem, so we will all be gone?'
Israel ordered the evacuation, claiming it was attempting to minimise civilian casualties as it launched a ground war against Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people.
But after telling Palestinians to leave their homes, Israel bombed sites in the south, including areas it had declared as safe.
Since Israel declared war against Hamas, it has killed more than 14,100 Palestinians in Gaza, the densely populated enclave run by the Palestinian armed group.
Shawwa, whose father, grandfather and great-grandfather all served as mayors of Gaza, is not sure evacuated Palestinians will ever be allowed to return.
Her sister, who still lives in Gaza with her family, had to leave because her house was damaged by bombing.
"My sister is not sure they can go back to their houses. Some of them tried and they were bombed,' said Shawwa.
Shawwa arrived in Athens in 2000 and now works for the Athens Bar Association.
Others have been here longer, in a community approximately 13,000-strong.

Razan Simaan's parents were forced from Palestine during the Nakba, or catastrophe, as it is known, of 1948.
Between 1947 and 1949, Palestinians were dispossessed and displaced as Israel was created, with Zionist paramilitaries forcibly removing 750,000 Palestinians from their homes. About 15,000 Palestinians were killed, including in several massacres.
Simaan was born in Beirut. Her family moved to Athens during the first Lebanese civil war.
Hamas's attack came as no surprise, she said.
'There's nothing happening that's new, it's just much more amplified,' Simaan said. 'We're a little bit in shock that this isn't clearer to the rest of the world. For us injustice is something we were born with and grew up with.'
Israel's Western allies - the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union – have labelled Hamas a "terrorist organisation".
'Hamas is irrelevant,' said Simaan. 'Hamas wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the occupation. It is a direct outcome of Israel.'
Other Palestinians agree with her.
'Anyone who is under occupation has the right to use whatever means necessary to be free,' said Latif Darwish, a professor of economics and crisis management at Cardiff Metropolitan University.
'Hamas simply launched a military attack, which is something Palestinians are on the receiving end of every day. It was not a crime,' Darwish said.
Like many Palestinians here, Darwish believed the Israelis knew the attack was coming and let it happen in order to invade Gaza.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently brandished a map showing all of Palestine as sovereign Israeli territory at the United Nations General Assembly.
'There was a plan to eliminate Gaza or the people of Gaza. They were looking for an excuse,' said Ahmed Hassan, the president of the Palestinian Association.
He pointed to reports that Egyptian intelligence had tipped off the Israelis of an impending attack on the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.
'Perhaps [the Israeli government] welcomed this attack without realising what the consequences would be,' Hassan suggested.
The Palestinians who spoke to Al Jazeera believed there was still hope for Palestinian self-determination and peace with Israel but were not sure what the formula should be.
'We don't hate like the Israelis … We don't see the Israelis as a different race. We even call them our cousins because we are similar,' said Shawwa.
She remembered sitting with her mother, an elected representative in the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature formed under the Oslo Accords in 1996. The accords promised eventual Palestinian statehood, and Shawwa witnessed Palestinians governing themselves in a time of hope.
'It was a really democratic debate,' she remembered. 'Although Hamas did not get in officially, a lot of their members were in. There were some Islamist-leaning members and Fatah, and also other factions … There was something really special about it.'
She believes Palestinians can regain this shining moment, when they came so close to independence, but even she does not believe the Oslo Accords can be revived.
'The two-state solution is dead. It's too late for it,' she said.
She also did not believe a Palestinian-Jordanian confederation could happen, something her grandfather once proposed. Nor did she believe Israelis were likely to invite the Palestinians into a unified state encompassing the West Bank and Gaza.
Darwish agreed that for such a 'South Africa scenario' to happen, 'Israel has to feel it is unsafe, that it will lose everything unless it makes some concession.' And Hassan did not think it was even desirable. 'Even the 1.5 million Palestinians [who are Israeli citizens] are third class citizens,' he said.
So what is the solution? US President Joe Biden said he remained committed to a two-state solution.
'Gaza and the West Bank should be reunited under a single governance structure … as we all work toward a two-state solution,' he wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece.
'What I do know is the people really want peace,' said Shawwa. 'We were not able to communicate this to Israel. This is the main problem.'
Darwish agreed that peace was the unifying factor.
'I would go back tomorrow, with all my children," he said. "Tomorrow.'

Hanan Saleh Abdullah Al-Barghouthi from Ramallah
Fatima Nasr Mohammad Amarnah from Jenin
When and how were they released?
They were transferred from Israeli prisons to the Israel-controlled Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank in the early evening.
At 8pm local time (18:00 GMT), they were released from Ofer in International Committee of the Red Cross buses.
Who might be released next?
Israel has agreed to release 150 Palestinian women and children prisoners from its jails in exchange for Hamas releasing 50 of the women and children taken captive during the  .
But the Israeli Ministry of Justice presented a list of 300 Palestinian prisoners who it is considering for release. It is unclear whetherthis might be an offer for a potential second phase of exchanges since the deal  the extension of a pause in fighting by one day for every 10 additional captives Hamas releases.
The list of 300 comprises 33 women. The majority of the rest of the names are of boys aged 16-18. However, there are also boys as young as 14 on the list.
Most of the prisoners on the list were arrested between 2021 and 2023. The prisoners arrested in 2023 were taken before October 7.
However, it also includes individuals like  , who was arrested in 2015 and is serving the ninth year of her 16-year sentence. Dwayyat is currently serving the longest sentence among Palestinian female prisoners in Israeli jails.
She was 18 when she was arrested and held in the Damon prison in Haifa, accused of stabbing an Israeli settler with a knife. Her family, anxiously anticipating her release, denies these accusations. 'Shorouq is delicate and cannot harm an animal,' her father, Salah Dwayyat, told  Al Jazeera at the time.

Why are they in prison?
Like Dwayyat, many other prisoners have been convicted of crimes including carrying and manufacturing knives and daggers. Other common offences detailed in Israel's list include:
threatening security
illegally entering Israel without a permit
throwing stones
supporting terrorism
associating with hostile/unknown organisations.
'The main alleged crime for these detentions is stone-throwing, which can carry a 20-year sentence in prison for Palestinian children,'   a report published in July by children's rights organisation, Save the Children.
Israeli publication Haaretz reported that Israel has refused to release people convicted of murder but those convicted of attempted murder could be released.
Where will the Palestinian prisoners go after their release?
Under the deal, Palestinian prisoners will be taken from   southeast of Haifa, namely Damon and Megiddo. They will then be taken to Israel's military Ofer prison.
There, they will be handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross and after they are received, "the ones from Jerusalem will go to Jerusalem, and the ones from the West Bank will gather in Betunia municipal council where their families will be waiting', added Fares.
Israel has barred celebrations in Palestinian communities over the return of prisoners.
How many Palestinian prisoners are in Israeli jails?
There are   within Israel and one inside the occupied West Bank holding Palestinian prisoners.
Before October 7, there were about 5,200 Palestinians in Israeli custody. However, following the Hamas attack of October 7, the number of Palestinians arrested skyrocketed and 3,000 more were arrested.
(Al Jazeera)
Of those arrested after October 7, 37 are journalists. Palestinian prisoner support and human rights association Addameer reported that most of these journalists were subjected to administrative detention, which means they are held indefinitely behind bars without facing trial or charges.
Addameer also reported that the detainees are subjected to physical violence and medical negligence in prisons. The report cited an example of a prisoner who suffers from blood disease and asthma. The prisoner was assaulted, resulting in wounds and bruises on his head and eyes. The association reported that this prisoner has lost 10kg since his arrest.

Some Palestinian prisoners have been in Israeli jails for more than 30 years, since before the   were signed. The term 'deans of prisoners' is sometimes locally used to refer to them, reported Samidoun, an international Palestinian prisoner solidarity network.
At least 700 Palestinian children under the age of 18 from the occupied West Bank are prosecuted every year through Israeli military courts after being arrested, interrogated and detained by the Israeli army.
Children in Israeli detention often suffer physical, psychological and sexual abuse, and some are deprived of food, water and sleep, according to Save the Children.

Central London was packed with tens of thousands of people who turned out to demand a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
The National March for Palestine on Saturday took place on the second day of a  , which has seen the release of hostages held by the Palestinian group since October 7 and Palestinians jailed in Israel.
The Palestine Solidarity Campaign estimated a turnout of 300,000 people calling for "an end to the siege of Gaza".
Protests and solidarity marches have been held in   and   since the start of the Israel-Palestine conflict seven weeks back.
The Metropolitan Police said at least five people were arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred, including for distributing "literature featuring a swastika inside a Star of David".
The force said 1,500 officers were deployed to police the march.

As Israel bombs Gaza, Ireland's enduring support of Palestine gets stronger

November 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Ireland is once again an outlier in the West, home to some of the loudest criticism of Israel and support of Palestinian rights, as the Middle East conflict rages.
After Hamas launched an assault in Israel on October 7, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varakdar decried the deadly incursion, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 240 were taken captive.
But less than a week later, he became one of the few European officials to raise alarm.
'Israel doesn't have the right to do wrong,' he said in something of a play on words as most European leaders were stressing Israel's "right" to self-defence during its bombing campaign on Gaza, the enclave ruled by Hamas.
 , more than 11,400 Palestinians have been killed by Israel.
Varadkar has also said Israel's bombardment 'amounts to collective punishment', which is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions.
Michael D Higgins, the 82-year-old Irish president whose role is largely ceremonial, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was 'not speaking  for Ireland' when she expressed unconditional support for Israel on October 16 without acknowledging the ongoing occupation of Palestinian lands.

After Israel began striking Gaza, Ireland, a member of the European Union, was one of the first countries to call for an 'immediate humanitarian ceasefire' to meet the 'urgent' needs of civilians.
Niamh Nichillin – a 50-year-old primary school teacher in Tipperary and a member of Fianna Fail, one of two governing centre-right parties – is among the many in Ireland who sympathise with the people of Gaza, one of the world's most densely populated areas often described as an open-air prison due to Israel's blockade of the enclave.
'Israeli air strikes on Gaza are clearly disproportionate towards a civilian population with little or no defences,' she told Al Jazeera. 'This can hardly be called a war in the usual sense of the word.'
Statements by Israeli officials indicate they are motivated by a 'desire for the destruction of Gaza', she said. 'This is unacceptable.'
On October 18, Ireland announced an additional 13 million-euro ($14m) package of humanitarian funding for Palestinians, lifting the 2023 total to 29 million euros ($31.5m) with the foreign ministry saying it was aware the unfolding situation in Gaza is a 'humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented magnitude'.
'I would like the Irish people to continue to use their influence to ensure that there is a ceasefire, an end to the siege and that enough humanitarian aid is getting through,' said Nichillin, who welcomed the news of extra aid.
What lies behind Irish support of Palestine?
In 1980, Ireland was the first EU country to call for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Thirteen years later, it became the last member of the bloc to open an Israeli embassy in Dublin.
In 2018, Ireland drew worldwide attention when independent politician Frances Black proposed the Occupied Territories Bill, which would have banned and criminalised trading goods and services from lands occupied by Israel.
Although it enjoyed support across the political spectrum and the public, it was removed from the government's programme during coalition negotiations in 2020 between the two ruling parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.
In 2021, Ireland became the first EU country to declare that Israel was involved in the 'de-facto annexation' of Palestinian land, upsetting Israel's foreign ministry, which said the move 'constitutes a victory for extremist Palestinian factions'.

'Ireland's own history of colonisation by the British has made many Irish people empathetic towards other nations under occupation or colonisation,' said Cathal O'hEanna, a representative of the left-wing nationalist party Sinn Fein.
'Our centuries-long struggle for the right to self-determination resonates with the Palestinian struggle for statehood and independence,' she told Al Jazeera.
John Lyndon, executive director of the Alliance for Middle East Peace, said: "What's interesting is that at first there was Irish solidarity with Jews in Mandate Palestine and then early Israel because they were seen as fighting British colonialism, using some of the same paramilitary tactics as the IRA. And some also had an affinity with the kibbutz movement and the socialist ideals of early Israel."
Today, as the war escalates, pro-Palestine protests continue throughout the country.
On Wednesday evening, more than 1,000 people rallied outside the lower house in Dublin as a motion to expel Israeli Ambassador Dana Erlich, who has accused Higgins of 'spreading misinformation' about the Israel-Hamas war, was being voted on.
The motion – which was put forward by the Social Democrats and supported by Sinn Fein and the Trotskyist People before Profit party – was defeated. Another motion tabled by Sinn Fein calling on Ireland to refer Israel to the International Criminal Court was also defeated.

Celebrated Irish writers are also organising. Authors including Sally Rooney, Sinead Gleeson, Donal Ryan and Colin Barrett are participating in four Irish Writers for Palestine events from November 28.
'Writers, especially in Ireland, occupy a certain cultural position, and we hope to use that position to do what we can to show our solidarity,' said Michael Magee, one of the organisers. 'Voices sympathetic to the Palestinian struggle, both within Israel and across Europe and the US, are facing more marginalisation and violent suppression than ever.'
Lyndon said that although he understands his fellow citizens, he feels that it is 'important to be careful' about how solidarity with the Palestinian cause is expressed.
'The [October 7 attacks] triggered memories of the Holocaust for the Israeli side while the Palestinians now feel that they are reliving the Nakba. I'd like to see more solidarity with Palestinians and Israelis working together to end the occupation and ensure self-determination for each rather than one side fighting the other.'
Lyndon tragically lost a friend, the longtime advocate for Palestinian rights  , in the Hamas attacks.

Ireland should position itself as a peace negotiator, he said, because it has its 'own history with conflict resolution' through its efforts to bring about the Good Friday Agreement.
That Ireland 'does not have the same 'colonial baggage' as other EU countries' would reassure Palestinians if the country were present in any negotiations.
'Ireland's relationship with the US is also very good, so I would like to see Ireland use those strengths to play a better diplomatic role [in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict],' said Lyndon.
Opinion divided along sectarian lines
While Irish citizens of the Republic of Ireland overwhelmingly support the Palestinian cause, the picture is different in Northern Ireland, where people endured 30 years of violence known as the Troubles between nationalists and unionists.
That conflict largely came to an end with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.
Opinions on the Middle East are divided along sectarian lines to a degree with Palestinian flags a common feature in the nationalist neighbourhoods of Belfast and Israeli flags in the unionist areas.
While these flags have long flown, more have appeared since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.
Amr Hashad, an activist in Belfast, said he sees similarities between the nationalist struggle in Northern Ireland for independence from the UK, which led to the emergence of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provos) in 1969 following widespread violence against the Catholic community, and Hamas, which was founded in 1987 at the start of the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising.
However, after the Provos launched an attack in London in 1995, 'the British government and the EU negotiated with this army and even asked US President Bill Clinton for help in doing so until they managed to find a solution to the conflict', Hashad said.
'Today, we find ourselves in a similar situation to the Provos' secret attack on London where Hamas attacked Israel and the entire Gaza Strip is being punished mercilessly as innocent women, children and the elderly are killed with the support of the West. The question I ask myself is: Why aren't the West negotiating with Hamas like it did with the Provos?'

Soon after the October 7 attacks, Sinn Fein, in contrast with statements made by other Western governments and political parties, said that while it had 'no plans to meet or engage' with Hamas, it would 'not rule out meeting with or talking to anybody' as part of efforts to secure peace in the Middle East.
Ireland is not among the small minority of EU countries that officially recognises Palestine and, in line with the bloc's position, considers Hamas a terrorist organisation. The Irish parliament put forward a motion in 2014, calling on the government to formally recognise its statehood, but the push remains in limbo.
Michael Martin, foreign minister, said in September that the government was preparing to recognise Palestine as an independent state.
Andrew Cottey, a professor at the University College Cork's department of government and politics, said that despite the political and public support of Palestine, 'whatever the rights or wrongs of recognising Palestine, it would put Ireland in a minority within the European Union' and 'significantly at odds with the United States on this issue'.
'You can make an argument for recognising Palestine, but were Ireland to do that, would it have any substantive impact on the situation on the ground in Israel and Palestine? Probably not. And the kind of political cost for the Irish government would be to antagonise the United States and isolate itself within the European Union.'
Stephanie Nic Carthaig, a translator who believes Ireland should officially recognise Palestine, said she understands Cottey's argument, but added: 'Neoliberalism in Irish politics, servile attitudes to empire and influence from the US are behind this slowness to recognise Palestine.'
Irish composer Raymond Deane, co-founder of the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, criticised his country's position on numerous fronts.
'Ireland should disassociate itself from EU policy [on Israel and Palestine] from dealing exclusively with the Palestinian Authority, which has no real authority, and cease to repeat the 'two-state solution' ad nauseam,' he told Al Jazeera.
He would also like to see Ireland put an arms embargo on Israel and witness the Occupied Territories Bill implemented.
While the Irish government has gone further in its condemnation of Israel than other EU countries, Nichillin, Deane and Nic Carthaig are not alone in wanting the Irish government to do more.
Mary Lou McDonald, president of Sinn Fein, has said recognising Palestinian statehood would top the foreign policy agenda should her party lead the government.
Sinn Fein met with ambassadors from Arab countries this month to discuss Gaza and the need for 'dialogue' to secure a just and lasting peace, including a 'viable state of Palestine'.

As the United Nations votes on Gaza, Palestine can only observe

October 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The 193 members of the United Nations General Assembly are expected to vote on the Israel-Gaza war on Friday, but as an observer rather than a member, Palestine will not have a say.
Jordan, acting on behalf of Arab countries, has proposed a General Assembly resolution calling, among other things, for a humanitarian ceasefire after the smaller more powerful UN Security Council   to take action,despite the rising death toll from Israel's continued bombardments.
'I appeal to all of you to vote to stop the killing. Vote for humanitarian aid to reach those whose very survival depends on it. Vote to stop this madness,' Palestine's UN ambassador Riyad Mansour said in an   to the UN General Assembly on Thursday.
The Palestinian foreign minister also addressed the UN Security Council at a special session this week, but as a non-member observer state, Palestine is not able to participate in the same way as full UN member states.
As UN members continue to discuss how they will respond to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, here is a quick guide to Palestine's status at the UN.
Non-member observer
In 2012, the majority of the 193 members of the General Assembly voted to grant Palestine non-member observer status.
A total of 138 of the UN General Assembly's 193 members voted yes, while nine voted no and 46 abstained or did not vote.
Among the countries that voted no were the United States, Israel and Canada as well as Pacific Island nations including Nauru and Palau.
Non-member state observer status is not officially recognised in the UN Charter but has a long history. It was first held by Switzerland and is currently held only by Palestine and the Holy See, also known as the Vatican.
The decision to grant Palestine non-member status was far from the first, or last time, the General Assembly has voted on Palestine.
In 1947, the then-members of the UN General Assembly voted on a resolution  titled the future government of Palestine.
The resolution decided that Palestine would be '[partitioned into two states' with the creation of 'Independent Arab and Jewish States' as well as a 'Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem'.
The resolution passed with 33 of the then-57 members of the UN General Assembly voting yes.
The number of members of the UN at the time was significantly smaller than it is today, as dozens of present member states had yet to gain independence from European colonial powers.
Two years later, in 1949, the State of Israel was admitted to the UN as its 59th member.
Who represents Palestine?
On Tuesday this week, Palestine's Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki addressed the UN Security Council open debate.
Al-Maliki is part of the Palestinian Authority, which is led by a different political grouping to Hamas, which controls Gaza.
The Palestinian Authority continues to represent Palestinians at the UN although at home its   on behalf of all Palestinians is complicated.
Could Palestine become a full UN member?
In 2019, the UN General Assembly voted to allow Palestine to temporarily exercise limited additional powers while it chaired the Group of 77, a grouping at the UN which originally had 77 members, but now has more than 130.
One of the countries that opposed the temporary measure was Australia.
Gillian Bird, Australia's ambassador to the UN at the time told the General Assembly that Australia voted no because it saw "Palestinian attempts to seek recognition as a state in international fora [as] deeply unhelpful to efforts toward a two-state solution ."
While the General Assembly casts votes on new proposed members, it is the Security Council which decides  which candidates are considered.
The council has 15 members, but the five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the US – have the power of veto. The US has used it some   to block resolutions critical of Israel.
Who gets to vote?
"When the Security Council is unable to act, the General Assembly must step up," Dennis Francis, the president of the General Assembly, said when he called a special meeting of the General Assembly this week at the request of Jordan, Mauritius and several other countries.
NEW: Arab Group circulates amended #UNGA  draft resolution to #UN  member states which replaces call for immediate ceasefire in #Gaza / #Israel  with a call for an immediate, durable & sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities.
Amended draft now https://t.co/KoWtWmCnMI pic.twitter.com/niilXg3X7N
- Rami Ayari (@Raminho) October 26, 2023
Unlike the Security Council, which has only 15 members, the UN General Assembly includes all 193 of the UN's member states.
Votes in the UN General Assembly are also less complicated than in the Security Council, where resolutions have often been blocked by the permanent  . China, Russia and the United States have all used their veto to block Security Council resolutions on Israel-Gaza in the last two weeks.
But while UN General Assembly members do sometimes take a different approach to Palestine than the UN Security Council, UN General Assembly resolutions are considered less legally binding than Security Council resolutions, especially when it comes to the currently much-contested calls for ceasefires.
As both UN bodies continue to consider their carefully worded resolutions, Mansour reminded UN members to 'remember we are meeting here while Palestinians in Gaza are under the bombs'.

November 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Hamas has said that about 30 people were killed in an Israeli attack on a United Nations-affiliated school in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, as the clock ticks down on a   between the Palestinian group and Israel.
On Thursday, the Gaza Ministry of Health reported 27 fatalities from that strike on the Abu Hussein School run by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which was housing displaced Palestinians fleeing violence and intense bombardment in other parts of Gaza.
Israeli forces also launched fresh attacks on the   in northern Gaza, targeting the main entrance and power generators.
Ashraf al-Qudra, the ministry's spokesperson, said the hospital had come under 'intense bombardment', and that 'large parts of the building' were being targeted.
More than 200 patients, medical staff, and internally displaced people were currently at the hospital in Beit Lahiya, which has been under siege for a week.
Meanwhile, Israeli fighter jets hit the Sheikh Nasser neighbourhood in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, killing at least five people and wounding dozens, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
It also reported that at least 10 people were killed when Israeli forces attacked a residential home in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood in northern Gaza.
In the occupied West Bank, 12-year-old Mohammed Ibrahim Fuad Edely was shot and killed by Israeli forces, according to the Palestinian ministry.
The incident brought the number of Palestinians killed in the occupied West Bank since   to 229, 52 of them children.
Israel's relentless bombardments have killed more than 14,800 people in Gaza since October 7, according to Palestinian officials. In Israel, the official death toll from Hamas's attacks stands at about 1,200.

Fighting to continue
Mediator Qatar announced that a   between Israel and Hamas is set to begin at 7am local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday.
But Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant called the upcoming pause a 'brief respite at the end of which the fighting will continue intensely, and we will create pressure to bring back more hostages' during an interview with a navy special operations unit on Thursday.
'At least another two months of fighting is expected,' he said.
Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said:'The [captive release] outline is not the end of the process but the beginning.'
'In the coming days, we will focus on planning and completing the preparations for the next stages of combat.'
A spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, Abu Obeida, said that Palestinian fighters remain ready to confront Israeli forces so long as the war continues and called for resistance to Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.

'Pipe dream': Why is the US pushing the Palestinian Authority to lead Gaza?

November 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - United States officials have increasingly suggested that the Palestinian Authority (PA) should rule   after Israel achieves its objective of eliminating Hamas, the group that currently controls the territory.
But analysts warn that the proposal may be unrealistic and premature, as the Israel-Hamas war nears the start of its seventh week.
US President   and his top aides have repeatedly expressed full support for the Israeli offensive in Gaza, but Washington has nevertheless offered indications of what it would like to see after the conflict.
The Biden administration said it does not support an indefinite Israeli military presence in the territory, and it opposes downsizing the besieged strip or permanently displacing its population.
But if Israel manages to dislodge Hamas from Gaza — a goal that is far from guaranteed — bringing the PA back to Gaza would face many hurdles, including Israeli opposition.
Earlier this month, PA President   seemed to predicate the authority's return to Gaza on the condition that a "political solution" to the conflict is reached, one that would include the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
"At several different levels, this is just a pure pipe dream," Osamah Khalil, a history professor at Syracuse University, said of handing Gaza to the PA.
Why is the US pushing for it?
Khalil said the Biden administration is facing mounting pressure over its support for Israel, due to the atrocities it is accused of committing in Gaza. At least   have been killed so far, with   warning of a "grave risk of genocide" in the territory.
So the Biden camp is trying to switch the focus to the end of the conflict, by asserting that Palestinians must eventually govern Gaza themselves, Khalil explained.
"It's for domestic audiences because there is an absolute absence of political will in the United States — particularly going into an election year — to hold Israel to account," Khalil told Al Jazeera.
He added that there is "an absolute dearth of fresh ideas in Washington", leading to a policy of "avoiding conflict resolution and focusing on conflict management".
Both the US and Israel have ruled out the possibility of dealing with Hamas politically after the war.
How did we get here?
The PA — which is controlled by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and its dominant   — was established in 1994 as part of the Oslo Accords, which sought to shift the occupied Palestinian territories from Israeli military control to civilian leadership.
Oslo promised an eventual Palestinian state, but the so-called   never led to a resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Over the next decade, the PA continued to oversee a limited form of self-governance over the West Bank and Gaza, co-existing with the Israeli occupation that has had near total control over security matters in the Palestinian territories.
In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew its military forces and dismantled its settlements in Gaza, but it maintained control over movement in and out of the coastal enclave.
One year later, Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in a blow to the PA.
With Hamas committed to armed struggle against Israel and the Fatah sticking to the peace process, the two parties were not able to reconcile their differences.
Meanwhile, Hamas faced increasing international pressure, and fighting broke out between the group and the PA. In 2007, Hamas took over Gaza and has maintained control of the territory ever since. For its part, the PA remained in the West Bank as Israel proceeded with its settlement expansion there.
The rift effectively split the Palestinian national movement. Repeated attempts to bridge the gap with  .
With the peace process frozen, Israel blockaded the Gaza Strip while further entrenching its military occupation of the West Bank with US support, in violation of international law.
What have US officials said?
Operating under the assumption that Hamas will be eliminated by the end of the current Israeli offensive, the US is now looking to the PA to govern Gaza once again.
Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf told lawmakers last week that the PA is the "only Palestinian government that has come out of the Oslo Accords".
"Whatever its shortcomings, it is the government for the Palestinians in the West Bank," Leaf said. "We do believe that ultimately Palestinian voices and aspirations have to be at the centrepiece of   and security in Gaza."
She added that "the PA is the appropriate place to look for governance".
Secretary of State Antony Blinken also suggested that the PA would take over Gaza eventually. He said earlier this month that a lasting peace "must include Palestinian-led governance and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority".
Biden and his aides have also talked about reviving the two-state solution to the conflict.
However, Khalil Jahshan, executive director of the Arab Center Washington DC, a think tank, said that, so long as the US does not call  , talking about what happens after the war is a "waste of time".
He added that Palestinians should have one authority in the West Bank and Gaza — but after a ceasefire and a democratic election.
"But to bring a dysfunctional Authority in the West Bank basically to a total pile of rubble in Gaza, it's a formula for disaster," Jahshan told Al Jazeera.   has damaged nearly half the residential buildings in the territory.
Khalil, the history professor, echoed Jahshan's comments about the infeasibility of the US proposal.
"Israel has no intention of agreeing to a Palestinian state," Khalil told Al Jazeera. "And at the end, the PA can't come back in on the back of Israeli tanks and say, 'We're the new authority.'"
What has Israel said?
Israeli Prime Minister  , whose right-wing Likud Party opposes establishing a Palestinian State, has all but dismissed the assertions of his US allies, saying that Israel would maintain security control over Gaza.
"Gaza has to be demilitarised and Gaza has to be de-radicalised," he told NBC News  last week. "And I think, so far, we haven't seen any Palestinian force, including the Palestinian Authority, that is able to do it."
Jahshan said it is unlikely that the US would meaningfully pressure Israel towards a broader resolution to the conflict anyway.
"This administration proved that   of showing the political or the moral will or the diplomatic skills to get us closer to that idea," Jahshan told Al Jazeera. "So it's preaching it, but only as a defence mechanism for its diplomatic failure in the region. It is not a realistic option."
Khalil also suggested that the US is not serious about resolving the conflict. He said the US is floating the return of the PA to allay internal dissent over the Western support for Israel.
Discussing future governance, Khalil added, also buys the Israelis more time to achieve a so-far elusive victory in Gaza.

Khalil noted that after more than 40 days of relentless bombing, Israel is still far from neutralising Hamas. The Palestinian group continues to target Israeli troops.
Israeli forces have also failed to free the captives taken during Hamas's October 7 attack, and they have not killed senior political or military leaders from the Palestinian group.
What has the PA said?
Still, President Abbas, 88, has expressed willingness to bring the PA back to Gaza, but only as part of a broader solution.
'We will fully assume our responsibilities within the framework of a comprehensive political solution that includes all of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip,'   as telling Blinken by the official Palestinian news agency Wafa earlier this month.
But for some analysts, the PA's shortcomings in the West Bank and its increasingly ageing and isolated leadership make it a non-starter to lead the Palestinian national movement.
Adam Shapiro, the director of advocacy for Israel-Palestine at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a US-based rights group, pointed to Israel's deadly raids and the   occurring on a near-daily basis across the West Bank, right under the PA's nose.
"It's really mind-boggling," Shapiro said of suggesting the PA as a solution for Gaza. "It begs the question of whether these officials think that we're not paying attention, or if they're just simply not paying attention."

Israeli forces carry out deadly raids in the West Bank amid Gaza truce

Israeli forces have killed six Palestinians, including one minor, in the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, taking the total number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank to 239 since October 7.
Israeli forces shot dead five Palestinians in the city of Jenin late on Saturday and early Sunday, and killed a sixth in the village of Yatma, near Nablus, the ministry said on Sunday. Six other Palestinians were injured in the Israeli raid in Jenin.
Palestinian news agency Wafa said Israeli forces stormed Jenin "from several directions, firing bullets and surrounding government hospitals and the headquarters of the Red Crescent Society".
The Israeli military spokesperson's office said it was looking into the reports.
The raids come despite an ongoing four-day truce between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas in the war-torn Gaza Strip, where nearly 15,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,000 children, have been killed in Israeli strikes.
Israeli officials said 1,200 people were killed in the surprise Hamas attack on October 7, when the Palestinian group took about 240 people captive.
On Saturday, Hamas released 13 Israeli and four Thai captives, while Israel released a first batch of 39 Palestinian prisoners in exchange. More Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners are expected to be freed on Sunday.
Since October 7, Israeli forces have killed at least 237 Palestinians, including 52 children, in the occupied West Bank, while arresting more than 3,000 people, as it intensified raids in the West Bank since launching its military offensive on Gaza.
Last year was the "deadliest" for the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since 2006, according to the United Nations. Israeli forces had killed 170 Palestinians in those areas in 2022. This year, Israeli forces and settlers have killed at least 371 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
'For every Palestinian prisoner [the Israelis] release, there seems to be a continued disregard for the freedoms of Palestinians they continue to detain, a continuous disregard for Palestinian life as they continue to kill people in very violent and endless raids in the occupied West Bank,' said Al Jazeera correspondent Zein Basravi, reporting from Ramallah in the West Bank.
Seven weeks of relentless Israeli attacks in Gaza killed at least 14,854 Palestinians, more than a third of them children, and displaced at least 1.5 million, according to Gaza officials.

Pro-Palestinian Israelis face threats, but vow to keep fighting for peace

On Monday, a peace activist from Be'er Sheva, in southern Israel, learned that his friend, Khalil Abu Yahia, a resident of the war-torn Gaza Strip, had been killed in an Israeli air strike.
'He was one of the organisers of the Great March of Return,' said YossefMekyton, visibly shaken and emotional when referring to the March 2018 to December 2019 pro-Palestinian protests held along the Israel-Gaza border.
'And he was killed with his whole family.'
Mekyton, an Israeli citizen, has long supported the rights of the Palestinians.
But since the events of October 7 - when Hamas fighters breached the Gaza border with Israel, killing some 1,400 Israelis, prompting an unprecedented scale of bombardment on the Palestinian enclave - Mekyton says that many Israeli-based activists live in a climate of 'fear'.
'I think one of the most effective ways to commit suicide these days in Israel is to go out on the street with a Palestinian flag,' the graphic designer told Al Jazeera.
While the treatment of activists felt threatening before October 7, it is "much more threatening" now, he said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to destroy Hamas - which has controlled the impoverished Gaza Strip since 2007 - following the group's incursion and kidnapping spree.
But Israel's relentless shelling of Gaza has killed 8,500 Palestinian civilians, including more than 3,500 children.
Israeli troops claim that among the dead are several Hamas commanders. The Palestinian group has not yet announced any deaths of its fighters.
On Wednesday, as fighting raged, the Israeli military struck the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, a day after it first bombed the site, killing dozens of Palestinians.
Fear and panic have gripped most sections of Israeli society following the Hamas attacks, making the activities of Israel's activist population more conspicuous than ever.
'I am facing harassment by individuals on social media,' said Israeli Ofer Neiman, a pro-Palestinian resident of Jerusalem and supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions(BDS) movement, which is committed to putting political and economic pressure on Israel to end its occupation of the Palestinian West Bank and blockade of the Gaza Strip.
'Will it get worse? Yes, perhaps - it is concerning.'
On October 28, dozens of Israelis attended an anti-war protest in Tel Aviv - widely regarded as a liberal city.
'In terms of going out to demonstrate, I would feel reasonably safe in the Tel Aviv demonstration. But in other places, such as in Jerusalem where I live, I would not feel safe," said Neiman.
Right-wing voices 'dominate' discourse
Last month, Israeli Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai   there would be 'zero tolerance' for domestic rallies supporting Gaza.
But there are signs of a crackdown that go beyond protests.
Israeli Jewish sociolinguist Uri Horesh recently announced that he had been suspended from his lecturing role at Israel's Achva Academic College, citing his opposition to the attacks on Gaza as the reason for his dismissal.
Israel Frey, an ultra-Orthodox Israeli journalist, was forced into hiding after expressing support for the people of Gaza – which he said made him the target of far-right activists.
And it was reported that an Israeli citizen had been arrested on account of a publicly displayed sign.
'There is no sanctity in an occupied city," read the sign, which had reportedly been hung from the window of his Jerusalem home for years.
Jerusalem: 10 police officers break in to the house of an Israeli activist, arresting him for this years old sign he has hanging out the window, reading 'there is no sanctity in an occupied city' (sounds better in Hebrew).

'The [dominant] voices that we are hearing [in Israel] are either right-wing voices for genocide or mainstream voices for war, maybe not always with the genocidal language, but still in favour of bombing Gaza,' said Neiman of the prevailing mood in Israel.
Neta Golan, an Israeli pro-Palestinian activist and an active member of Israelis Against Apartheid, said the Hamas attack on southern Israel – while painful – has not dampened her spirit.
'But that doesn't mean that we don't feel for those [Israelis] who were affected or for the families of the hostages,' said the seasoned campaigner in Nablus, in the occupied West Bank.
Golan says she had 'been arrested more times than I can count' by Israeli authorities for her activism in the past.
Her group sent a letter to Karim Khan, prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, on Wednesday requesting 'accelerated action against the escalating Israeli war crimes'.
'We really hope that all civilians everywhere return to their homes, whether it's the Israelis returning to their families or Palestinians returning to their homeland from which they were expelled [when Israel was established] in 1948," she said.
Tali Shapiro, another Israeli activist based in the occupied West Bank - in Ramallah - also says she did not question her long-held pro-Palestinian convictions following the events of October 7.
'What it did cause me to do, was to call my parents in the south [of Israel] to make sure they were okay,' Shapiro told Al Jazeera. 'And to open up my account [on X] to look for my Gazan friends because obviously [we knew where] this was going.'
For Mekyton, the conflict has strengthened his commitment to keep campaigning for Palestinian rights.
'But it also [makes me feel] weakened," he said. "I feel so powerless right now - but I feel like I want to do something. I hope this contradiction will resolve itself somehow.'

Israeli soldiers have shot and killed at least one Palestinian man in the West Bank in the latest violence in the occupied territories.
Muhammad Rumaneh from the Amari refugee camp in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah was killed late on Friday, his death prompting a general strike there on Saturday.
The Israeli army said Rumaneh and another man threw Molotov cocktails at an army post near Ramallah. The condition of the other Palestinian was unclear.
"Soldiers conducting routine activity at the scene identified the suspects and responded with live fire. Two assailants were neutralised and transferred to receive medical treatment," the army said.
Israeli soldiers opened fire at the pair's car, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa.
The Palestine Red Crescent said the army did not allow its ambulances to come to the aid of the two after they were shot, and Rumaneh later died of his wounds, reported Wafa.Hamas said Rumaneh was a member.
Israeli authorities are withholding his body. Unable, therefore, to hold a funeral for the young man, residents of Ramallah called for a general strike to pay tribute to him.
Shops and businesses were closed and students stayed home, Wafa reported. Student groups at Birzeit University also called off Sunday classes.
Israeli officials have suggested in the past that holding onto the bodies of Palestinians slain in security incidents can deter attacks and prevent the exaltation of assailants at funerals that often draw giant crowds.
Violence in the West Bank has intensified in the last year as Israel has stepped up its near-nightly raids. The number of settler assaults on Palestinian villages has also surged.
In the past week alone, a Palestinian teenager was   while six other Palestinians were killed during   in the illegally occupied territory.
The United Nations has said 2023 is the deadliest year for Palestinians since it started counting fatalities in 2006.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the start of the year, according to the health ministry. Palestinian attacks against Israelis have killed at least 30 people since the start of 2023.

Washington, DC - State lawmakers and Palestinian rights supporters, joined by actor and progressive advocate Cynthia Nixon, have launched a five-day hunger strike outside the White House to demand a  .
At a news conference on Monday, the activists decried United States President Joe Biden's role in supporting the Israeli offensive in Gaza and called for an immediate end to the fighting.
The hunger strike adds to the   for a ceasefire from activists, artists and politicians, as well as staff members working in the  . But Biden has so far resisted such calls, voicing unwavering support for Israel.
Biden has also pledged more than $14bn in additional US aid to Israel — funds that advocates say are contributing to the Israeli violence.
The protesters at Monday's event stressed that public opinion polls show that most Americans back a ceasefire. They also underscored the scale of the destruction in Gaza, where more than 14,800 Palestinians have died. United Nations experts have warned that the conflict puts Palestinians "  ".
"How many more Palestinians must be killed before you call for a ceasefire, President Biden? We cannot wait any longer," said Iman Abid, an organiser with the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR).
Israel and Hamas declared a four-day truce in the conflict last week, and on Monday, officials announced the pause in fighting would continue for two additional days, to allow for the release of more Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners.
The hunger-strikers said that the continued pause demonstrates that diplomacy — not bombs — can solve the crisis in Gaza.
Israeli leaders, however, have suggested that they   the bombing with more intensity once the truce expires. They have also warned residents from northern Gaza against returning to their homes.
"The area north of the Gaza Strip is a combat zone, and it is forbidden to stay there," Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said last week.
This week's hunger strike in Washington, DC, is organised by Palestine solidarity advocates, progressive Jewish groups as well as Arab and Palestinian-American organisations.
Here's what some of the hunger-strikers at the White House had to say:

Nixon: 'Never again' means never again - for anyone
Best known for her work in the TV series Sex and the City, Nixon used her speech at Monday's event to highlight the carnage in Gaza, including the killings of dozens of journalists and UN workers as well as the destruction of 
"Our president's seeming disregard for the incredible human toll Israel's   is exacting on innocent civilians does not remotely reflect the desire of the overwhelming majority of Americans," she said.
"And I would like to make a personal plea to a president — who has himself experienced such devastating personal loss  — to connect with that empathy for which he is so well-known and to look at the children of Gaza and imagine that they were his children.
"We implore him that this current ceasefire must continue, and we must build off it to begin to negotiate a more permanent peace. We cannot keep letting American tax dollars aid and abet the killing and starvation of millions of Palestinians. 'Never again' means never again — for anyone."
Delaware lawmaker Madinah Wilson-Anton: Majority of Americans want ceasefire
Wilson-Anton, a Muslim American legislator from Biden's home state of Delaware, said that while she is anxious about abstaining from food for several days, her thoughts are with the people of Gaza who are experiencing a massacre with no choice or end in sight.
"The majority of   are for a permanent ceasefire. And it's unfortunate that our president and our congressional members are not being responsive to what's important to Delawareans and Americans from all states," Wilson-Anton, a Democrat, said.
"And so I'm hoping that, this week, we'll be successful in gaining the ear of our president and of our congressional members, so they can actually start to use their privilege and position to negotiate a ceasefire that is lasting."

New York State Representative Zohran Mamdani: Negotiations, not war, freed captives
Mamdani hailed the release of Israelis held by Hamas and Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during the truce.
"We are hunger striking for a world where everyone is with their family. And it is a world that can only be made possible through a ceasefire. It is not war that brought us these reunifications. It is negotiations; it is a cessation [of hostilities]," he said.
"We hunger-strike not because we want to. We hunger-strike because we have been forced by this president and by our government's foreign policy. We hunger-strike because Palestinians   in life and death, and their experience has been erased."
Activist Rana Abdelhamid: Dehumanising rhetoric normalises Palestinian deaths
Abdelhamid, a New York organiser, linked the killing of Palestinians in Gaza to a rise in prejudice against Arabs and Muslims in the US. She pointed to Saturday's shooting of three   in a suspected hate crime as an example.
"As someone who has been organising against hate-based violence across this country, I'm fully aware that the violence and the anti-Palestinian rhetoric that we're seeing abroad is also impacting us here in the United States. Those two things are inextricably linked," Abdelhamid said.
"When our elected [officials] and our politicians and our representatives are continuously dehumanising Palestinian people, are normalising Palestinian deaths, we get what we got two days ago. We get three Palestinian students in Vermont being shot for simply  , for simply speaking Arabic."
Palestinian-American writer and advocate Sumaya Awad: The US is complicit
Awad stressed that the US is "complicit" in the ongoing violence against Palestinians. She added that the conflict also has   in the US.
"I'm Palestinian and I'm a New Yorker. I'm an American and I'm a mother of a 16-month-old, and I'm on hunger strike to illustrate to our government just a sliver, a fragment of what Palestinians are enduring in Gaza every single day," Awad said.
"I am on hunger strike to demand a permanent ceasefire and to say that we will continue to pressure our government in every way possible to get that permanent ceasefire because we are not just silent observers. We are complicit in what is happening in Palestine.
"We are on hunger strike because what's happening in Gaza is not something far away that we have nothing to do with. It has real impacts on our lives here in the US."

'Complete censorship': Germany's Palestinian diaspora fights crackdown

October 26th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Berlin, Germany – In the immediate aftermath of Hamas's attacks on Israel on October 7, a Palestinian flag was painted on a monument near Sonnenallee, commonly known as Berlin's Arab street, in the southwestern district of Neukoelln. Authorities painted over the flag on the same night.
In contrast, the city's Brandenburg Gate was lit up the next day in the blue and white colours of the Israeli flag.
The disparate visual examples have come to represent the fault lines existing in Germany during the latest escalation of violence in the Middle East. Hamas fighters killed more than 1,400 people in Israel. A relentless bombing campaign by Israel on the Gaza Strip since then has killed more than 7,000 Palestinians and flattened entire neighbourhoods.
  has committed German support to Israel and promised to prohibit all Hamas activities in the country and target suspected Hamas sympathisers.
Samidoun, known as the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, was banned shortly after the group posted photos online of people allegedly celebrating Hamas's attacks.
Pro-Palestinian protests in many parts the country as well as Palestinian flags, pro-Palestinian speech and the Palestinian keffiyeh headdress have been   with schools in Berlin given official permission to do so.
Police violence against protesters has been reported in major German cities such as Frankfurt, Munich and Berlin, where riot police were stationed for days in a row on Sonnenalle as anger against Israel's bombardment of Gaza spilled out on the streets.
Berlin is home to one of the largest Palestinian diaspora communities in Europe, estimated at 300,000.
Cultural institutions, meanwhile, have reported pressure to cancel events featuring groups critical of the Israeli state while the Frankfurt Book Fair postponed an event set to honour Palestinian writer Adania Shibli for her book A Minor Detail.
Authorities say measures are being taken to protect against public disorder and anti-Semitism. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior told Al Jazeera that while in Germany freedom of opinion and freedom of assembly is allowed, there are clear limits.
'All instruments of assembly law must be used to prevent solidarity demonstrations with the terror of Hamas as early as possible,' the spokesperson said.
Yet pro-Palestinian supporters say this position has led to the crackdown and criminalisation of Palestinians as well as an attack on the rights of whole communities and people across Germany who want to speak out against Israel's attacks.
'Nobody expected our protest last week to be cancelled as we have been holding them peacefully with police cooperation for years," Amir Ali, a Palestinian who has been involved in organising protests in Munich, told Al Jazeera. "I was even forbidden to walk inside the city for 24 hours because I was wearing a keffiyeh. There's a crackdown on all pro-Palestinian voices across Germany, and in my opinion, they don't want anybody to speak up about the crimes against humanity being committed by the Israeli state.'
Majed Abusalama is a Palestinian political activist based in Berlin with Palestine Speaks,  a Palestinian rights group that's active across Germany. Abusalama has been sharing on social media the losses of his family and friends in Gaza. He said Palestinians are being subjected to racial profiling and being prevented from openly mourning.
'At our demos, we have experienced police racially profiling andthe targeting, arrests and detainmentof non-white and Palestinian-looking men specifically. That tells a lot about the racist infrastructure that the German police are a part of.'
Germany's 'Staatsraeson'
While the latest measures are particularly stringent, Palestinian supporters have faced restrictions even before October 7. This year, Berlin authorities banned demonstrations to mark 75 years since the Nakba, or "catastrophe", when most Palestinians were driven from their homes before and after the declaration of the state of Israel.
Sa'ed Atshan, associate professor of peace and conflict studies and anthropology at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, said there were a number of reasons why Germany is currently doubling down on this position.
'Part of it is an underlying racism where there's a hierarchy of humanity whereby Palestinian life is not seen as equal," Atshan said.
"There's also an environment of anxiety, fear and xenophobia around refugees from the Middle East that are highly stigmatised within the German landscape,' he added.
German-Israeli art historian and archaeologist Katharina Galor, who with Atshan co-authored The Moral Triangle, a 2020 book that explores the asymmetric relationships between Israelis, Palestinians and Germans in Berlin, said  .
'It's very much in line with the German attitude since the 1970s, which is standing with Israel politically in the Middle East and providing support to its military,' said Galor, a professor at Brown University, also in the United States. 'Israel's security and existence is Germany's 'Staatsraeson', or 'reason of state'."
That has had consequences for Germany's Palestinian community and its sympathisers.
'What this has meant is a complete censorship of Palestinian voices. There is a large Palestinian community in Berlin who understand the history and the context of violence who cannot speak because it has not only social consequences. It can have consequences for their lives and survival, including job losses,' she added.
Commentators say the current position is also in line with Germany's decades-long commitment to atone for the Holocaust. Galor said that while these efforts have been appreciated by Jewish people such as herself who lost family in Nazi concentration camps, there has been little attention in German society to address the Holocaust in relation to the  .
'One of the shocking discoveries we found was that even among educated Germans, there was no knowledge or school education about the Nakba and how these two events are connected," she said. "Germans for the most part are so concerned with taking responsibility for the Holocaust that what is happening in the Middle East only touches and concerns them if it regards the wellbeing of Jewish citizens.'
What's also missing, Atshan said, is the recognition that Germany is supporting a behaviour reminiscent of what the country has tried to move on from.
'Unfortunately, while many think that they've moved past the ultranationalism, violence and racism of the Nazi regime, they've now put themselves in a position in which they are reproducing those patterns with regards to the Israeli state," Atshan said.
"So it's incredibly ironic.And forGermany to say that this discussion is not allowed, it's profoundly anti-democratic.'
Protests to continue
Despite the protest bans, thousands of people took to the streets across Germany – from Berlin to Frankfurt and Cologne – in solidarity with Palestine last weekend, and more protests are planned.
And pressure is mounting on German authorities to end the current crackdown. This past week, 100 Jewish artists, writers and scientists based in Germany signed an open letter appealing for peace and freedom of expression.
Ali says that in Munich, they are exploring legal routes to have the bans overturned. 'German and Western governments need to change their attitude because the way they have acted in solidarity with Israel isn't changing anything. The occupation needs to stop, apartheid needs to stop and Palestinians need to be granted full equal rights for this to completely end.'
Abusalama added: 'Palestinians have not given up for 75 years, and a new generation will not forget nor forgive Israel for their crimes nor Germany for their complicity."
It's critical, he said, that Palestinians be "allowed to talk about the Palestinian struggle through the Palestinian narrative."
"I'd like Germany to stand on the right side of history and condemn crimes against humanity and apartheid," Abusalama said. "B ecause in my opinion, they have failed history, they have failed the Palestinians and have mobilised their guilt to silence and terrorise Palestinians in their everyday lives.'

Israeli settlers steal Palestinian farmers' land in occupied West Bank

Farmers in the occupied West Bank face near-daily incursions and violence from Israeli settlers, to the point that they live in fear of having their homes and land stolen, they say.
Added to that is the violence they witness in nearby urban areas, like   that the Israeli army stepped up raids on, killing 10 people and wounding 20 in just one week.
According to the Ministry of Health, at least 237 Palestinians have been killed and about 2,850 others injured by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank since October 7.
Farmer Ayman Assad, 45, and his family can clearly hear the attacks from their home just 2km (1.2 miles) from the camp and they have made the past few weeks a nightmare for him, his wife and five children.
'The children are constantly scared, and they don't play outside any more, it's too dangerous,' he told Al Jazeera.
'We can hear the attacks on the refugee camp, explosions and gunshots.'
Assad said his children are no longer going to school because even if they were to brave the route there, the Israeli army is blocking many of the roads in the area. All classes have gone online.
The greatest worry right now is that his chicken farm, which is further away in Area C of the West Bank, will be attacked by Israeli settlers while he is unable to defend it. 'I'm scared my land will be stolen.'
Olive groves in the West Bank [Al Jazeera]
Palestine is known for its olives, olive oil and vegetables, which are exported far and wide. The olive trees, in particular, are an important symbol of Palestinians' attachment to their land.
The West Bank has been occupied by Israel since 1967. Since then, about 700,000 Israeli settlers have illegally settled in the Palestinian territory. and have  , farmland and property there for years.
But these incursions have stepped up in recent weeks, as   while Palestinians are  , Abbas Milhem, director of the Palestinian Farmers' Union (PAFU) in Ramallah said. His own family's farm was among those targeted.
'A second war is happening in the West Bank'
Just over two weeks ago, armed Israeli settlers invaded the Milhem farm, fired guns in the direction of the people working on the harvest and stole olives.
One of the workers at the farm, Iman Abdallah Jawabri, 45, was harvesting olives in a crew that included her husband when five settlers came in.
'They shot towards us as if they wanted to scare us, then when they came closer, they took our phones to prevent us from taking photos of them. Then they told all the women to leave and started hitting the men, forcing them to sit on the ground under the olive trees.
'We (the women) were still looking at them from afar. After this, they took all of our olives and forced us to leave."
The farm is now under military control despite being in Area B of the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority technically controls civilian matters. The Milhems and their workers have been unable to return.
'The farmers are afraid of being shot if they do,' said Iman.
'I have several grandchildren and fear for the future, but I also thank God for what we have and pray for the people of Gaza,' she added.
'There is a second war in Palestine which is happening in the occupied West Bank,' said Milhem. 'It is also crucial to understand how it affects farmers in the occupied West Bank.'
He added that he cannot travel to visit his ageing mother in Jenin because Israeli forces have blocked many of the roads.
'I am also afraid when my sons go out at night, and I call them constantly to see if they are OK,' he said.

'They have guns – I only have my hands'
According to Human Rights Watch, Israeli security forces have killed more Palestinians in the occupied West Bank between January 1 and October 6 this year than in any year since 2005, when the United Nations began recording fatalities. This has raised Palestinian fears for their safety and the safety of their families, in addition to their fears for their livelihoods.
Being unable to move around the West Bank to work since October 7 due to the vastly increased raids and curfews by Israeli forces and armed settlers means Palestinians are facing a crisis.
According to the UN, poverty has   and gross domestic product declined by 4.2 percent since October 7.
Milhem said exports have completely stopped and nearly 50 percent of olives have not been harvested because of restrictions by the Israeli army on Palestinians' movement.
Another Palestinian farmer, Salah Awwad, 28, lost his home and land in Wadi Tahta in the south of the occupied West Bank in August. Settlers invaded his land, poured benzene around his property and set it on fire, destroying his beehives.
They took over the land and Awwad was forced to flee with his family of eight children. After a few days, he said, he was able to retrieve his 100 sheep, but he can no longer return to the land.
Since October 7, conditions at his new home in Sha'ab Tariq, 9km (5.6 miles) away, have worsened and now his livelihood is in the balance: he is not allowed to let his sheep graze, he told Al Jazeera.
'The settlers are surrounding my home, and they are not letting me work,' he said. 'I am afraid I might be shot, as they carry guns. What can I do? They have their weapons; I only have my hands.'
Awwad added that, while life was difficult before the war began, prices have now risen sharply, particularly for farmers. The price of fodder for his sheep has risen by more than one-third since October 7.
'No one is looking at us, only God,' he said. 'But I will not move again, even if they try to force me.'

Palestinian officials welcomed their first Saudi Arabian ambassador, even as the kingdom mulls over establishing formal  .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's diplomatic adviser Majdi al-Khalidi received a copy of the credentials of Ambassador Nayef al-Sudairi as a non-resident envoy in Jordan on Saturday, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa.
Al-Sudairi, the kingdom's current ambassador to Jordan, will also serve as consul general in Jerusalem.
Al-Khalidi said the occasion is "an important step that will contribute to further strengthening the strong brotherly relations that bind the two countries and the two brotherly peoples', Wafa reported.
The Saudi envoy also called the appointment "an important step", which underscores the desire of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman "to strengthen relations with the brothers of the State of Palestine and give it a formal boost in all areas", he said in video broadcast by the Saudi state-affiliated Al-Ekhbariya channel.
The file for the Palestinian Territories has traditionally been handled by Saudi Arabia's embassy in Amman.
Palestinian analyst Talal Okal said the new appointment is a step towards an official Saudi representation office in the occupied West Bank.
"It is also a message Saudi Arabia was committed to the rights of the Palestinians in a fully sovereign state," Okal said.
Push for normalisation
The ambassador's appointment occurred while the United States is looking to normalise Israeli-Saudi relations.
The US, Israeli and Saudi officials, however, have said any such deal is   off, as a number of thorny issues – from Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank, to Saudi nuclear power development – stand in its way.
Riyadh has repeatedly said it will stick with the decades-old Arab League position of not establishing ties with Israel until the conflict with the Palestinians is resolved.
Still, in recent months, Riyadh and Washington have held talks concerning Saudi conditions for normalisation. These include security guarantees and assistance with a civilian nuclear programme.
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said on Thursday "peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is a matter of time".
According to Aziz Alghashian, a Saudi analyst and expert on Saudi-Israeli relations, Saturday's move "gives insight into how diplomatic relations might be between Saudi Arabia and Israel: a Saudi ambassador to Palestine with a file for Israel'.
"The immediate signal is to treat Saudi demands for Israeli concessions seriously,' Alghashian said.
Last week, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said the Palestinian Authority is hoping to relay its concerns to Saudi officials about the normalisation push.

Will Egypt accept Palestinians displaced by Israel's war on Gaza?

November 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi appears unlikely to absorb the 2.2 million Palestinians who could be displaced from the Gaza Strip during the Israel-Hamas war, experts have told Al Jazeera.
'My assessment is that it is a 95 percent non-starter,' said Nancy Okail, president and CEO of the Center for International Policy, a progressive nonprofit in Washington, DC.
'The political cost outweighs any of the benefits,' she added, pointing to the potential for domestic unrest in Egypt if an influx of Palestinian refugees were to arrive.
But the prospect of a mass displacement from Gaza – a narrow, densely populated territory on Egypt's northeast border – has heightened concerns in el-Sisi's government.
On October 24, +972 Magazine and its sister publication Local Call reported on a leaked document  allegedly from Israel's Ministry of Intelligence, outlining a proposal to 'evacuate' all Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt.
Rumours are also swirling that Israeli leaders are attempting to entice Cairo into accepting displaced Palestinians by offering to write off some of its bloated external debt, which hovers  at about $160bn.
In addition, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly lobbied European leaders to help him convince el-Sisi to take in refugees from Gaza — an idea he has so far rejected.
'It is entirely understandable why the Egyptians and Palestinians fear that there are Israeli leaders that seek to forcefully and permanently displace Palestinians from Gaza,' said Timothy Kaldas, an expert on Egypt's political economy for the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.
He added that Palestinians should still be granted the right to seek asylum in neighbouring countries, a protection that Egypt and Israel are denying them.
'Palestinians should still have the choice – and I emphasise the choice – to move into Sinai and seek safe haven. They should not be forced to be subjected to indiscriminate bombardment in Gaza,' Kaldas told Al Jazeera.
A high 'political cost'
A majority of Palestinians were expelled from their homeland in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel — an event they refer to as the Nakba, or 'catastrophe'.
Most people in Gaza today are the children or grandchildren of those displaced during the Nakba. They now risk being permanently uprooted again, which is a war crime under international law.
The question of Palestinian rights has always been a popular cause in Egypt, according to Okail. If el-Sisi acquiesces to pressure to absorb Gaza's population, he could trigger widespread outrage and protests.
'The political cost [for aiding the displacement of Palestinians] could be el-Sisi's presidency,' Okail told Al Jazeera.
Such a move, Okail said, would likely be interpreted as helping Israel to expand and entrench its occupation of Palestinian territories. Any resulting unrest could prompt the military to topple el-Sisi in order to restore order, she added.
'Any expression of dissent in the public domain in Egypt is going to be highly sensitive for the army,' Okail said. Its members 'are known to be completely against the idea of allowing the Palestinians to be removed from their land and into [Egypt]'.
Security dilemma
El-Sisi has also articulated concerns that accepting refugees from Gaza might invite Palestinian fighters to take root in Egypt.
During a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on October 18, el-Sisi made the case that Palestinians dislodged to Egypt's Sinai region may establish a 'new base' to carry out 'terrorist operations'.
'Israel would have the right to defend itself and its national security and therefore directly strike Egyptian lands,' el-Sisi said.
This scenario threatens to upend the peace deal between Egypt and Israel, brokered by the United States at the Camp David Summit in 1978.
Kaldas believes that el-Sisi's security fears are legitimate. He added that Egypt is probably more worried about the arrival of smaller armed groups than Hamas, the Palestinian organisation whose surprise attack on Israel helped spark the current war.
'That's not to say they're not worried about Hamas, but they have a more clear and direct relationship with the group,' Kaldas told Al Jazeera.
Since 2016, relations between Egypt and Hamas have thawed . The two sides first cooperated to crack down on cells from the ISIL (ISIS) group. Then Egypt resumed mediating ceasefires between Hamas and Israel – a role that has restored some of el-Sisi's regional influence.
But el-Sisi's government is still wary of Hamas due to its heavy military arsenal and its affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood, a group it vilified and repressed to consolidate power in Egypt.
What's more, el-Sisi may believe the arrival of armed Palestinian groups could inspire youth, disenfranchised by Egypt's economic crisis, to join their ranks, according to Okail.
'Many of these people frankly have nothing to lose and may be tempted to join,' she told Al Jazeera.
An opportunity amid the pressure
Though el-Sisi has so far resisted calls to accept displaced populations from Gaza, some experts believe the Egyptian president is nevertheless using the situation to his advantage.
Hossam Bahgat, the founder of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), told Al Jazeera that el-Sisi's government is using Western support for Israel to argue it would be hypocritical to criticise human rights abuses in Egypt.
'Pro-regime figures on social media are highlighting how all the Western talk about human rights for the last 10 years — all the US congressional oversight and conditioning of military aid — was just part of a Western conspiracy to weaken the state,' Bahgat told Al Jazeera.
Countries like the United States have documented 'credible reports' of human rights abuses in Egypt, including torture, extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances. El-Sisi's government, however, has denied those charges.
But Bahgat said the pressure some countries are placing on Egypt to potentially allow the forced displacement of Palestinians – a grave crime – will give el-Sisi greater cover to commit human rights violations domestically.
'The regime won't even have to be mindful of its image,' Bahgat said.

'Many players have died': Israel's war on Gaza hits Palestinian football

October 30th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Covering football can lead many journalists to resort to hyperbole. When Middlesbrough overcame a three-goal deficit to beat FC Basel in the quarterfinals of the 2006 UEFA Cup, the late commentator Alastair Brownlee screamed  that it was "the greatest comeback since Lazarus!"
Two years later, 80km (50 miles) west of Bethany, where Lazarus rose from the dead, a Palestinian footballer actually repeated the Biblical feat.
In December 2008, amid deadly Israeli air raids on the Gaza Strip, Hazem Alrekhawi, then 19 and a promising player with Shabab Rafah, got on a bus with nine of his classmates from the technical college he was attending in Gaza City.
A missile fired from an Israeli F-16 fighter jet struck the bus, apparently killing everyone on board. The bodies were taken to  . Alrekhawi, whose body was covered in shrapnel, was wrapped up and put into the morgue's refrigerator.
Five hours later, his mother arrived at the hospital, looking to identify the corpse of her son. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed a hand moving. Alrekhawi was alive.
Alrekhawi escaped with his life but it looked unlikely the defender would be able to continue his football career due to the severity of his injuries.
The Rafah native defied the odds though, and in 2011, he made a move to the occupied West Bank – where players are better compensated – playing for eight different clubs over 10 years.
This summer, he decided to return to his hometown club Shabab Rafah, in part to join his brother Mohammed, 38, who was set to retire at the end of the 2023-24 season.
On October 11, amid intense   following   in Israel, Mohammed had a brush with death. Photographs showed the striker being pulled from the rubble of his home, emerging  bloodied and wearing a pair of Shabab Rafah shorts.
Israel's attacks on Gaza have   since. While there has been no further news of the brothers' safety, they have not appeared on the lists of the dead released by the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Much like the Alrekhawi brothers, Palestinian football has been thought dead only to return.
The Palestinian Football Association (PFA) was founded in 1928 and it joined FIFA the following year. But over time it became an exclusively Jewish organisation and changed its name to the Israel Football Association in 1948, after the founding of the state of Israel.
While Palestine national teams played in the subsequent decades, it was not until 1998 when the PFA was reborn and Palestine became a full FIFA member – a half-decade after   ("catastrophe" in Arabic), in which thousands of Palestinians were killed and more than 750,000 uprooted to create the state of Israel.
Palestinian football survived the upheaval of the second Intifada from 2000 to 2005, deepening occupation, and five Israeli wars on Gaza, with the national team successfully qualifying for three straight Asian Cup competitions.
But with no end in sight to the  , gearing up for the start of the 2026 World Cup qualification in November and the Asian Cup in January 2024 might prove the toughest challenge yet.
Meanwhile, footballers in Gaza remain subject to the full wrath of Israel's war.
'We will die in silence'
Mohammed Balah, 30, left Gaza for Jordan six years ago to forge a professional career. His exploits earned him a national team debut shortly thereafter and a career across five clubs in the Jordanian, Omani, and Egyptian top-flights.
Like Alrekhawi, Balah decided to return to Gaza this summer in search of consistent playing time following an   (ACL) injury while playing for Al-Masry in the Egyptian Premier League. He had hoped to parlay that into a return to the national team. That is unlikely to happen now.
Balah had survived previous attacks on Gaza; in May 2021, his home was demolished  by an Israeli air raid. But in one of his last messages  on social media, dated October 10, he was less optimistic about surviving the latest round of violence.
"Maybe [in] a few hours, we will be cut off from the world, due to a power outage and the batteries will lose the charge. The Israelis bombed the telecommunications and internet company, they bombed the electricity company and the power generators in the streets," he wrote.
"The rest of the generators don't have any stock of diesel. We will die in silence, away from the eyes of the world and friends."
When Balah first made his way out of Gaza, he did so with his friend and teammate Mahmoud Wadi. The pair signed for Al-Ahli Amman before parting ways.
Wadi, now 28, went to Egypt and became the most expensive transfer in Palestinian football when he transferred to Pyramids FC in 2021 for a fee of 17 million Egyptian pounds ($1.1m at the time).
In a tearful interview on October 22 with Cario-based OnTime  Sports channel, Wadi recounted the feeling of living through the 2014 war on Gaza.
"I would go to bed at night and stare at the ceiling expecting it to come crashing down on my head at any moment," he said.
The striker has only intermittent contact with his family and his friends since the start of this even more devastating war and although no current national or Olympic team player has yet died in this round of bombing, there have been several deaths in Gaza's football family.
'Many players that I played against or with while in Gaza have died,' Wadi said.
Khalil Jadallah, a Palestinian football commentator and analyst, put together a starting XI of Palestinian players who have died due to Israeli violence.
'It is difficult to know exactly how many have died during this war because of the sheer amount of death,' Jadallah told Al Jazeera.
Among the confirmed dead are athletes and administrators from a wide range of sports, including basketball player for Al-Breij, Bassim al-Nabahin, 27; footballer Rashid Dabbour (28), who played for Al-Ahli Beit Hanoon; and Ahmad Awad (21), who represented Palestine's national football team for dwarfism.
The Palestinian sporting community in the occupied West Bank has also been affected as   there. Nineteen-year-old Markaz Balata midfielder Mohammed Maree Sawafta was killed by Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces during a protest in his hometown of Tubas, near Nablus, on October 27.
'It's our responsibility to represent Palestine'
All types of sporting events have come to a grinding halt across Gaza, the occupied West Bank, and Israel. So it has been three weeks since any Palestinian footballer kicked a ball in a competitive match.
With football on an indefinite hiatus, Palestine national team players tried to leave for other countries. The deteriorating security situation in the occupied West Bank meant many of them were unable to travel between cities due to violence by Israeli settlers on the roads.
"Our team doctor tried to travel from his village to Ramallah but had to turn back because settlers attacked his car. They threw a big boulder at him, which smashed his windshield," a current national team player, who wished to remain anonymous, told Al Jazeera. "He was lucky to escape alive."
With the land crossing with Jordan closed for hours on end, Palestine were forced to withdraw from a tournament in Malaysia held from October 13 to 17.
All of the national team did eventually make it out of the country on Monday but were able to do so only after security was provided by the PA. Coordination with Jordan's Prince Ali bin Al Hussein, who is also the president of the Jordan Football Association, was required to open the border and ensure the team's safe passage.
A squad of 20 players under Tunisian manager Makram Daboub will prepare for a crucial set of 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Lebanon (November 16) and Australia (November 21).
Things had been trending in the right direction for Palestine, who have a 100 percent record in competitive matches under Daboub.
There was also hope that an expanded World Cup with eight spots reserved for Asian teams in 2026 could lead to Palestine's first-ever appearance at football's showpiece event.
But if Palestine are to plot a path to the next World Cup, they will have to do so without the benefit of playing at home.
Palestine, who have never lost a World Cup qualifier on home soil,will instead have to host Australia on neutral ground in Kuwait.
The national team has come to rely less on Gaza-based players in recent years, with the territory's best talent flocking to the occupied West Bank and Egyptian leagues in search of better pay and playing conditions. A Gaza-based player has not been called up to the national team since goalkeeper Abduallah Shaqfa was called up for the Arab Cup in December 2021.
But the national team and wider Palestinian football "will definitely be affected by Israel's war on Gaza", Jadallah said.
"Players have been killed who might have gone on to play for the national team. The Yarmouk Stadium in Gaza has also been destroyed," he said.
"The lack of a home-field advantage will have a huge effect on the squad against a strong team like Australia. [Palestine] will also need to find a way to overcome the mental struggles they have been dealing with during the war."
Palestine's football team has been counted out and left for dead before, but perhaps this squad has more Lazarus-like comebacks in them.
For Mahmoud Wadi, football provided a lifeline.
"If not for football I might not be in the position I am today," Wadi said.
"Football helped me get out of Gaza and it's our responsibility to try and represent Palestine the best we can."

October 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced many millions of people and has its roots in a colonial act carried out more than a century ago.
With Israel declaring war on the Gaza Strip after an unprecedented attack by the armed Palestinian group Hamas on Saturday, the world's eyes are again sharply focused on what might come next.
Hamas fighters have killed more than 800 Israelis in assaults on multiple towns in southern Israel. In response, Israel has launched a bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 500 Palestinians. It has mobilised troops along the Gaza border, apparently in preparation for a ground attack. And on Monday, it announced a "total blockade" of the Gaza Strip, stopping the supply of food, fuel and other essential commodities to the already besieged enclave in an act that under international law amounts to a war crime.
But what unfolds in the coming days and weeks has its seed in history.
For decades, Western media outlets, academics, military experts and world leaders have described the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as intractable, complicated and deadlocked.
Here's a simple guide to break down one of the world's longest-running conflicts:
What was the Balfour Declaration?
More than 100 years ago, on November 2, 1917, Britain's then-foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, wrote a letter addressed to Lionel Walter Rothschild, a figurehead of the British Jewish community.
The letter was short – just 67 words – but its contents had a seismic effect on Palestine that is still felt to this day.
It committed the British government to "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people" and to facilitating "the achievement of this object". The letter is known as the  .
In essence, a European power promised the Zionist movement a country where Palestinian Arab natives made up more than 90 percent of the population.
A British Mandate was created in 1923 and lasted until 1948. During that period, the British facilitated mass Jewish immigration – many of the new residents were fleeing Nazism in Europe – and they also faced protests and strikes. Palestinians were alarmed by their country's changing demographics and British confiscation of their lands to be handed over to Jewish settlers.
What happened during the 1930s?
Escalating tensions eventually led to the Arab Revolt, which lasted from 1936 to 1939.
In April 1936, the newly formed Arab National Committee called on Palestinians to launch a general strike, withhold tax payments and boycott Jewish products to protest British colonialism and growing Jewish immigration.
The six-month strike was brutally repressed by the British, who launched a mass arrest campaign and carried out  , a practice that Israel continues to implement against Palestinians today.
The second phase of the revolt began in late 1937 and was led by the Palestinian peasant resistance movement, which targeted British forces and colonialism.
By the second half of 1939, Britain had massed 30,000 troops in Palestine. Villages were bombed by air, curfews imposed, homes demolished, and administrative detentions and summary killings were widespread.
In tandem, the British collaborated  with the Jewish settler community and formed armed groups  and a British-led "counterinsurgency force" of Jewish fighters named the Special Night Squads.
Within the Yishuv, the pre-state settler community, arms were secretly imported and weapons factories established to expand the Haganah, the Jewish paramilitary that later became the core of the Israeli army.
In those three years of revolt, 5,000 Palestinians  were killed, 15,000 to 20,000 were wounded and 5,600 were imprisoned.
What was the UN partition plan?
By 1947, the Jewish population had ballooned to 33 percent of Palestine, but they owned only 6 percent of the land.
The United Nations adopted Resolution 181, which called for the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states.
The Palestinians rejected the plan because it allotted about 56 percent of Palestine to the Jewish state, including most of the fertile coastal region.
At the time, the Palestinians owned 94 percent of historic Palestine and comprised 67 percent of its population.
The 1948 Nakba, or the ethnic cleansing of Palestine
Even before the British Mandate expired on May 14, 1948, Zionist paramilitaries were already embarking on a military operation to destroy Palestinian towns and villages to expand the borders of the Zionist state that was to be born.
In April 1948, more than 100 Palestinian men, women and children were killed in the village of Deir Yassin on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
That set the tone for the rest of the operation, and from 1947 to 1949, more than 500 Palestinian villages, towns and cities were destroyed in what Palestinians refer to as the  , or "catastrophe" in Arabic.
An estimated 15,000 Palestinians were killed, including in dozens of massacres.
The Zionist movement captured 78 percent of historic Palestine. The remaining 22 percent was divided into what are now the occupied West Bank and the besieged Gaza Strip.
An estimated 750,000 Palestinians were forced out of their homes.
Today their descendants live as six million  refugees in 58 squalid camps  throughout Palestine and in the neighbouring countries of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt.
On May 15, 1948, Israel announced its establishment.
The following day, the first Arab-Israeli war began and fighting ended in January 1949 after an armistice between Israel and Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.
In December 1948, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 194, which calls for the right of return for Palestinian refugees.
The years after the Nakba
At least 150,000 Palestinians remained in the newly created state of Israel and lived under a tightly controlled military occupation for almost 20 years before they were eventually granted Israeli citizenship.
Egypt took over the Gaza Strip, and in 1950, Jordan began its administrative rule over the West Bank.
In 1964, the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) was formed, and a year later, the Fatah political party was established.
The Naksa, or the Six-Day War and the settlements
On June 5, 1967, Israel occupied the rest of historic Palestine, including the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan Heights and the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula during the Six-Day War against a coalition of Arab armies.
For some Palestinians, this led to a second forced displacement, or Naksa, which means "setback" in Arabic.
In December 1967, the Marxist-Leninist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine was formed. Over the next decade, a series of attacks and plane hijackings by leftist groups drew the world's attention to the plight of the Palestinians.
Settlement construction began in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. A two-tier system was created with Jewish settlers afforded all the rights and privileges of being Israeli citizens whereas Palestinians had to live under a military occupation that discriminated against them and barred any form of political or civic expression.
The first Intifada 1987-1993
The first Palestinian Intifada erupted in the Gaza Strip in December 1987 after four Palestinians were killed when an Israeli truck collided with two vans carrying Palestinian workers.
Protests spread rapidly to the West Bank with young Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli army tanks and soldiers.
It also led to the establishment of the Hamas movement, an off-shoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that engaged in armed resistance against the Israeli occupation.
The Israeli army's heavy-handed response was encapsulated by the   advocated by then-Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin. It included summary killings, closures of universities, deportations of activists and destruction of homes.
The Intifada was primarily carried out by young people and was directed by the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, a coalition of Palestinian political factions committed to ending the Israeli occupation and establishing Palestinian independence.
In 1988, the Arab League recognised the PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinian people.
The Intifada was characterised by popular mobilisations, mass protests, civil disobedience, well-organised strikes and communal cooperatives.
According to the Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem, 1,070 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces during the Intifada, including 237 children. More than 175,000 Palestinians were arrested.
The Intifada also prompted the international community to search for a solution to the conflict.
The Oslo years and the Palestinian Authority
The Intifada ended with the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993 and the formation of the Palestinian Authority (PA), an interim government that was granted limited self-rule in pockets of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The PLO recognised Israel on the basis of a two-state solution and effectively signed agreements that gave Israel control of 60 percent of the West Bank, and much of the territory's land and water resources.
The PA was supposed to make way for the first elected Palestinian government running an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with its capital in East Jerusalem, but that has never happened.
Critics of the PA view it as a corrupt subcontractor to the Israeli occupation that collaborates closely with the Israeli military in clamping down on dissent and political activism against Israel.
In 1995, Israel built an electronic fence and concrete wall around the Gaza Strip, snapping interactions between the split Palestinian territories.
The second Intifada
The second Intifada began on September 28, 2000, when Likud opposition leader Ariel Sharon made a provocative visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound with thousands of security forces deployed in and around the Old City of Jerusalem.
Clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces killed five Palestinians and injured 200 over two days.
The incident sparked a widespread armed uprising. During the Intifada, Israel caused unprecedented damage to the Palestinian economy and infrastructure.
Israel reoccupied areas governed by the Palestinian Authority and began construction of a separation wall that along with rampant settlement construction, destroyed Palestinian livelihoods and communities.
Settlements are illegal under international law, but over the years, hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers  have moved to colonies built on stolen Palestinian land. The space for Palestinians is shrinking as settler-only roads and infrastructure slice up the occupied West Bank, forcing Palestinian cities and towns into bantustans, the isolated enclaves for Black South Africans that the country's former apartheid regime created.
At the time the Oslo Accords were signed, just over 110,000 Jewish settlers lived in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Today, the figure is more than 700,000 living on more than 100,000 hectares (390sq miles) of land expropriated from the Palestinians.
The Palestinian division and the Gaza blockade
PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in 2004, and a year later, the second Intifada ended, Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip were dismantled, and Israeli soldiers and 9,000 settlers left the enclave.
A year later, Palestinians voted in a general election for the first time.
Hamas won a majority. However, a Fatah-Hamas civil war broke out, lasting for months,resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians.
Hamas expelled Fatah from the Gaza Strip, and Fatah – the main party of the Palestinian Authority – resumed control of parts of the West Bank.
In June 2007, Israel imposed a land, air and naval blockade on the Gaza Strip, accusing Hamas of "terrorism".
The wars on the Gaza Strip
Israel has launched four protracted military assaults on Gaza: in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021. Thousands of Palestinians have been killed, including many children , and tens of thousands of homes, schools and office buildings have been destroyed.
Rebuilding has been next to impossible because the siege prevents construction materials, such as steel and cement,from reaching Gaza.
The 2008 assault involved the use of internationally banned weaponry, such as phosphorus gas.
In 2014, over a span of 50 days, Israel killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians and close to 500 children.
During the assault , called Operation Protective Edge by the Israelis, about 11,000 Palestinians were wounded, 20,000 homes were destroyed and half a million people displaced .

Turkey's Erdogan tells pro-Palestinian rally Israel is 'an occupier'

At a massive pro-Palestinian rally in Istanbul, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Israel was an occupier in its war in Gaza, and repeated his stance about Hamas not being a terrorist organisation.
"I reiterate that Hamas is not a terrorist organisation. Israel was very offended by this … Israel is an occupier, Erdogan speaks clearly because Turkey does not owe you anything," he told hundreds of thousands of supporters on Saturday.
People gathered at Istanbul's Ataturk airport for a rally organised by Turkey's governing AK Party to protest against Israel's   of the Gaza Strip and call for a ceasefire.
Demonstrators chanted pro-Palestinian slogans and waved Turkish and Palestinian flags at the event dubbed the "Great Palestine Meeting" on Saturday, as Israel pushed forward with its "expanded" ground operation amid a near-total communications blackout in the Gaza Strip.
The rally was attended by leaders of other political parties, as well as high-profile media and sports figures – some of whom were expected to take to the stage during the event, local media reported.
Erdogan told the crowd that Western powers were "the main culprit" behind the Israeli army's "massacre" of Palestinians in Gaza.
"The main culprit behind the massacre unfolding in Gaza is the West," said.
'End the genocide'
Al Jazeera's Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from the rally, said this was "by far one of the strongest speeches that we've heard" from the president.
Protesters were seen wearing headbands with inscriptions such as "We are all Palestinians", "End the genocide", or "Be the voice of Palestinian children".
Since Friday evening, Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been largely cut off from all communications with each other, as well as with the outside world, as Israeli ground troops battle Hamas fighters inside the besieged enclave.
According to Palestinian health authorities, at least 7,703 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardment since October 7, including about 3,000 children. More than 1,400 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel.
Large protest in London; ban in Berlin
Meanwhile, thousands of protesters were seen pouring onto the streets of London to demand the British government to call for a ceasefire. Other rallies were taking place elsewhere in the UK, including in Manchester and Glasgow.
Aerial footage showed large crowds setting off on the march organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, with the protest due to end outside the Houses of Parliament after passing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Downing Street office.
Echoing Washington's stance, Sunak's government has stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, and instead advocated humanitarian pauses to allow aid to reach people in Gaza.
On Friday evening, police in Berlin again broke up several pro-Palestinian demonstrations.
More than 100 people were arrested in front of the Brandenburg Gate as a crowd chanted pro-Palestinian, and then anti-police, slogans during an unauthorised rally. Police clashed violently with some participants, injuring two officers, according to police.
Another pro-Palestinian demonstration on Alexanderplatz in central Berlin involving about 100 people was also broken up on Friday evening. Police said on Saturday that any would-be protesters were "aggressively approached and consistently expelled from the square".
Authorities in Berlin have banned most pro-Palestinian rallies or demonstrations in the weeks since the 7 October attack by Hamas.

Thousands of protesters chant 'Free Palestine' in New York City

Thousands of people have marched in New York City to support Palestinians and raise awareness about   in the Gaza Strip.
Protests were seen across multiple neighbourhoods in the sprawling United States city on Friday, with demonstrators chanting 'Free Palestine' and calling for an end to Israel's illegal occupation of Palestinian land.
Several blocks of Times Square were packed with mostly youthful but also older protesters, some of whom carried Palestinian flags or wore keffiyehs, with leaders on megaphones.
Protesters were heard chanting, 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free' which uses a slogan that some see as calling for equality between Palestinians and Israelis, but Jewish organisations have condemned as anti-Semitic.

Videos showed dozens of people demonstrating in front of Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer's home in Brooklyn on Friday night to demand a ceasefire as he was preparing to travel to Israel with a delegation of lawmakers.
New York City also saw counterprotests on Friday, with pro-Israeli demonstrators taking to the streets and at times getting into verbal arguments with supporters of the Palestinians.
The city had gone on a state of alert in preparation for the protests and police presence and patrols were ramped up in what some have called an International Day of Action for Palestine.
The protests ended up being largely peaceful, but several dozen people were reportedly arrested throughout the day, and in front of Schumer's home, as police officers tried to break up crowds.
New York, which is home to the largest Jewish community in the world outside Israel, has previously seen a series of demonstrations in support of the Palestinian cause as well as gatherings in solidarity with  .

'I feel it's my duty, not just as a Muslim, but also as a human being, to see everyone show up because of the crimes that the Israel occupation has caused upon the Palestinian people,' Laibah Faiaz, a 21-year-old protester in New York, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency.
'No one is acknowledging the scale of destruction that they've unleashed upon these innocent people,' she added.
Anas Amireh, a 51-year-old businessman and son of Palestinian immigrants, said that responding to the killings of innocents in Israel with 'another genocide in the Gaza Strip is a criminal war and it is wrong'.
Hamas, the political and armed Palestinian group that rules the Gaza Strip, launched its largest-ever surprise assault on Israel last Friday that killed at least 1,300 Israelis and foreign nationals.
Israel has since been heavily pounding the enclave of Gaza and has killed at least 1,900 Palestinians, including many women and children.
The United Nations described an Israeli order for 1.1 million   as 'impossible' and has called for a way to provide assistance to the many besieged Palestinians there who are now left without power, water or internet.

From sport to music, Chile's Palestinian diaspora rallies to support Gaza

November 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
They dart across the football pitch in a blur of red, white, black and green, the colours of their jerseys echoing the Palestinian flags waving in the stands.
But the players of Club Deportivo Palestino are almost as far from Palestine as it is possible to be.
Located more than 13,000 kilometres (8,200 miles) away, the football club finds its home in La Cisterna, a suburb of Santiago, Chile — a sign of the unique role the South Americancountry plays in the Palestinian diaspora.
Chile is home to the   outside of the Middle East, with approximately 500,000 citizens of Palestinian descent. And as the latest war in Gaza unfolds, the rising death toll has hit close to home for many Chileans, for whom Palestinian culture is threaded into everyday life.
'We're all subjects of this story,' Chilean rapper and musician Ana Tijoux told Al Jazeera, as she reflected on the ongoing war. 'We all have to stand up.'

The conflict began on October 7, when the armed group Hamas launched a   on Israel, killing 1,400 people and capturing hundreds more.
Ever since, Israel has led a   against Gaza, the narrow Palestinian territory home to an estimated 2.3 million people.   have been cut off.   have shut down. And more than   have died in the blasts, with nowhere to go for safety.
Tijoux, a Latin Grammy winner, has participated in one of the country's largest pro-Palestinian rallies to date, a concert to raise funds for the remaining hospitals in Gaza and the West Bank.
The history of violence and displacement that Palestinians have faced resonates withTijoux, who has Indigenous roots in Chile.
One of the best-selling Spanish-language rappers of all time, Tijoux has evencollaborated with the Palestinian British artistShadia Mansour,with whom she released an Arabic-Spanish protest anthem, 2014's Somos Sur.
'Why does what is happening in Palestine affect us? It has to do with colonisation, genocide, racism and ethnic cleansing. The same patterns of imperialism repeat,'Tijouxsaid.
Those patterns have, in part, shaped the large Palestinian diaspora in Chile. Three waves of migration have occurred since the end of the 19th century, according to Ricardo Marzuco, a professor at the Center for Arab Studies at the University of Chile.
The first came with the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the late 1800s, as Palestinian merchants sought opportunities in Latin America. After the empire's collapse, in the interwar period, a second outpouring occurred.
Then another major exodus began in 1948, when the state of Israel was formed and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced, in an event they refer to as the Nakba or 'catastrophe'.
As a result of the economic losses, instability and political persecution they faced, many Palestinians travelled to the Americas to seek opportunities in emerging economies.
"It was the idea of the American dream," said Marzuco.

Each successive generation that arrived in Chile created opportunities for more to follow, he added.
"It is related to the Arabic concept of extended family, the profound feeling of hospitality and solidarity," Marzuco said. "The first that arrived and prospered invited relatives to work in their businesses, consolidating into an important community."
A second-generation Palestinian Chilean, Marzuco said many Palestinians were also attracted to Chile for its mild coastal climate, similar to the Mediterranean environment of their homeland.
'They adapted well in Chile,' Marcuzo said. 'There was an affinity with the weather, the environment, and certain elements that belonged to the Chilean landscape.'
Those early waves of Palestinian arrivals encountered xenophobia and racism in Chile, though. They were often lumped together with other Arab immigrants as 'Turcos' or 'Turks', a term that grew to have a pejorative meaning.
But nowadays, Chileans of Palestinian descent are represented in some of the highest government offices. They includecurrentmayor andformerpresidential candidate Daniel Jadue and Senator Francisco Javier Chahun — politicians from opposite sides of the political spectrum. One is communist, the other right-wing.
'Solidarity with Palestine is expressed across political sectors,' said Marzuco.

Football also served as a means to build acceptance, according to Diego Khamis, the executive director of the Palestinian Community in Chile, an umbrella organisation that represents different Palestinian groups and businesses across the country.
Khamis is a loyal supporter of the Club Deportivo Palestino, a team founded by Palestinian immigrants in the 1920s.
'They thought one of the best ways to make Palestine visible is by creating a professional football club, so that 'Palestine' will appear in the newspaper at least once a week,' Khamis explained.
The team is part of the Palestinian Community in Chile.Since 1947, it has competed in the professional leagues and is regularly a leading contender in Chile's Primera División, the country's top league.
That gives it a platform to braid together Palestinian activism with football fandom, making slogans like 'Free Palestine' a part of everyday life forits legions ofsupporters.
'At a time when the world was saying that Palestinians didn't exist, in Chile, we knew it did. How can you say that something doesn't exist when it's so present here?' Khamis said.

The visibility of Chile's Palestinian community has in turn shaped the  , particularly in recent weeks.
Chilean President   has repeatedly   for Palestinian human rights since his   in 2022, even withdrawing the country's ambassador to Israel in condemnation of the current military offensive in Gaza.
'They've been among the first to take diplomatic action to protest what is happening,' Khamis said of Boric and  .
Agustina Manzur, a 24-year-old makeup artist, has been surprised at just how great the outpouring of support has been since the start of the war.
A fourth-generation Chilean of Palestinian descent, she recently attended a protest outside the Israeli embassy in Santiago, Chile.
Dressed in her keffiyeh —a traditional Palestinian scarf — and carrying a Palestine flag, shearrived early. She was stunned to see the number of protesters already there.
Hundreds of people had gathered outside the embassy.Thecrowdgrew so large that protesters spilled off the sidewalk and onto the busy road, cutting off traffic.
'It was comforting to see so many of us fighting for the same cause,' Manzur said. Lately, her social media has been awash with the devastation from Israeli attacks. 'I couldn't sleep. It totally consumed me.'
But she has found hope among members of Chile's large Palestinian community and its supporters, all raising their voices against the war. She plans to protest again soon.
'We have to speak up because people in Gaza cannot. They don't even have internet, light, or water,' Manzur said. 'We cannot physically get Palestinians out, so the least we can do is protest for them.'

Israel's deadly bombardment of Gaza has killed nearly 15,000 people, including 10,000 women and children, in over 50 days, making it the deadliest war for the besieged Palestinian enclave till date.
Israel has rebuffed calls for ceasefire as a four-day humanitarian truce comes to an end on November 28. The utter devastation of Gaza and the mounting death toll has triggered worldwide protests, bringing the decades-long issue to the centre-stage of global politics.
The Balfour declaration
The Israeli-Palestinian issue goes back nearly a century when Britain, which still controlled historic Palestine, pledged to establish a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine under the 
Jewish immigration to Palestine
A large-scale Jewish migration to Palestine began, accelerated by Jewish people fleeing Nazism in Europe. Between 1918 and 1947, the Jewish population in Palestine increased from 6 percent to 33 percent.
Palestinians were alarmed by the demographic change and tensions rose, leading to the   from 1936 to 1939.
Meanwhile, Zionist organisations continued to campaign for a homeland for Jews in Palestine. Armed Zionist militias started to attack the Palestinian people, forcing them to flee. Zionism, which emerged as a political ideology in the late 19th century, called for the creation of a Jewish homeland.
The UN Partition Plan
As violence ravaged Palestine, the matter was referred to the newly formed United Nations. In 1947, the UN adopted Resolution 181, which called for the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, handing over about   of the land to Jews. Arabs were granted 45 percent of the land, while Jerusalem was declared a separate internationalised territory.
The city is currently divided between West Jerusalem, which is predominantly Jewish, and East Jerusalem with a majority Palestinian population. Israel captured East Jerusalem after the Six-Day War in 1967 along with the West Bank – a step not recognised by the international community.
The Old City in occupied East Jerusalem holds religious significance for Christians, Muslims, and Jews. It is home to Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which is known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as Temple Mount.
In 1981, the UN designated it a World Heritage Site.
The Nakba
Leading up to Israel's birth in 1948, more than 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homes by Zionist militias. This mass exodus came to be known as the   or catastrophe.
A further 300,000 Palestinians were   by the  .
Israel declared the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980, but the international community still considers it an occupied territory. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
The Oslo Accords
In 1993, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the  , which aimed to achieve peace within five years. It was the first time the two sides recognised each other.
A second agreement in 1995 divided the occupied West Bank into three parts – Area A, B and C. The Palestinian Authority, which was created in the wake of the Oslo Accords, was offered only limited rule on 18 percent of the land as Israel effectively continued to control the West Bank.
Israeli settlements and checkpoints
However, the Oslo Accords slowly broke down as  , Jewish communities built on Palestinian land in the West Bank, grew at a rapid pace.
  in the West Bank and East Jerusalem grew from approximately 250,000 in 1993 to up to 700,000 in September this year. About three million Palestinians live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
(Al Jazeera)
The building of Israeli settlements and a   on occupied territories has fragmented the the Palestinian communities and restricted their mobility. About 700 road obstacles, including 140 checkpoints, dot the West Bank. About 70,000 Palestinians with Israeli work permits cross these checkpoints in their daily commute.
Settlements  are considered  . The UN has condemned settlements, calling it   in the realisation of a viable Palestinian state as part of the so-called  .
Blockade of Gaza
Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza in 2007 after the Hamas group came to power. The siege continues till date. Israel also occupies the West Bank and East Jerusalem – the territories Palestinians want to be part of their future state.
Israel imposed   on the Gaza Strip on October 9, cutting its supplies of electricity, food, water, and fuel in the wake of   inside Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed in that attack.
Israel and Palestine now
This is what Israel and Palestine look like now.
Today, about 5 million Palestinians live in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem and 1.6 million Palestinians are citizens of Israel. This makes up about half of their total population. The other half lives in other countries, including Arab countries. There are about 14.7 million Jews around the world today, of which 84 percent live in Israel and the United States. The rest live in other countries including France, Canada, Argentina and Russia.
 
Here is an account of Palestinian and Israeli lives lost to the violence between 2008 and 2023.

Palestinians, supporters fly flag in emotional World Cup qualifier

Palestinian flags and the black and white keffiyeh scarf have flown high at Kuwait's Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium as Palestine took on Australia in a World Cup qualifier.
Thousands of Palestinians and their supporters turned out on Tuesday at the 60,000-seat venue for the football game, Palestine's   since the start of  .
"Palestine is in our hearts. We came to the stadium, old and young, in support," Anfal Al-Azmi, a 45-year-old Kuwaiti woman, told the Agence France-Presse news agency.
Defender Harry Souttar's 18th-minute goal was all that separated the teams as Australia won 1-0 in a game where the action on the pitch was almost incidental.

The game was played more than six weeks after Palestinian Hamas fighters killed 1,200 people and took about 240 hostages in southern Israel, Israeli officials say, in an attack launched from the Gaza Strip on October 7.
Israel, promising to destroy Hamas, has unleashed a ferocious air and ground assault on Gaza in response, killing more than 14,100 people, including 5,600 children, according to Palestinian officials.
"We do not care about the match. We came to deliver a message," said Wael Youssef Labbad, 40, a Palestinian from Ashkelon, Israel.
"We, the Palestinian people, are always present with the keffiyeh and the flag."
Palestine's red, black, white and green flag was ubiquitous at the game – which was moved from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank because of the war – and many fans twirled the distinctive keffiyehs as they chanted.

Others held up "Free Gaza" banners and pictures of keys, symbolising the homes lost by Palestinians during the Nakba, or the catastrophe, when more than 700,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced around the founding of Israel in 1948.
Australia's players will donate a portion of their match fee to humanitarian operations in Gaza, whose situation was described as "horrific" by visiting coach Graham Arnold.
Not all the fans were Palestinian. Many came from communities in the oil-rich Gulf country.
"Kuwait and Palestine are one. Today we are guests of Palestine in their land," said Kuwaiti Ahmed Al-Anezi, 36, who was draped in the Palestinian flag and wore a keffiyeh.
"Today, I and my entire family came to provide support to the Palestinian people and to consolidate the first Arab cause in the souls of my children."
Syrian university student Yahya Shaher, 18, said: "We are here to support our brothers. We are one, and victory is ours."

Egypt's tricky calculation as Israel's assault on Gaza continues

October 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has hosted United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Cairo where they discussed the ongoing crisis in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel.
El-Sisi reiterated on Sunday his country's stance that Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip had 'exceeded the right to self-defence' and amounted to collective punishment.
He added that Egypt's priority was to end the violence and provide humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians trapped in Gaza.
Small moves in Sinai, demonstrations in Cairo
Egypt has opened up its airport in El Arish to receive international assistance for the besieged people of Gaza, with planes arriving from Jordan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, among others.
Combined with donations from Egypt, they have been loaded into more than 100 trucks, which are lined up in the northern Sinai Peninsula and ready to enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing. A blood donation campaign was initiated by the Egyptian government, with donation centres set up in all governorates.
After negotiations with the US and others, Egypt agreed to an exchange, whereby it would allow the exit of dual-national Palestinians trapped in the blockaded enclave into Egyptian territory in return for Israel allowing safe passage for the humanitarian aid.

However, no movement on either side of the border has taken place as on Saturday, Egypt was informed that Israel had rejected safe passage for the aid trucks.
In response, Egypt refused entry to its territory for Gaza's dual-nationality citizens, making it clear that their exit from the Strip was contingent on Israel allowing the passage of the aid convoy into the enclave.
The exact number of Palestinian dual-nationals stuck in Rafah is not clear. According to the US government, between 500 and 600  US passport holders are thought to be trapped in Gaza.
French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna will be visiting Cairo on Monday and is expected to discuss allowing dual nationals to leave Gaza as there are several French citizens there.
As the impasse wore on, images on social media appeared to show Egyptian workers erecting concrete blocks along their side of the Rafah crossing on Saturday.
Observers have noted Egyptian wariness about the Rafah crossing and on Tuesday, news outlet Al Ahram Online quoted knowledgeable sources as saying there were plans by 'some parties and forces' to forcibly displace Palestinians from their land and resettle them in Sinai.
The Palestinian cause has long enjoyed widespread support in Egypt, leading to official nervousness over the reaction and making it into the content of the sermons after Friday prayers.
According to the independent media outlet Mada Masr, the government had feared 'chaos' that may have resulted from overzealous Friday sermons, especially from Al-Azhar, Egypt's theological authority and the most famous mosque in Cairo.
Beyond Friday prayers, Egypt witnessed a number of rallies in support of Palestine throughout the week. A conference is expected to be held tomorrow by the Egyptian journalists' syndicate to launch a weekly report on crimes committed by the Israeli army against journalists, with 10 Palestinian and one Lebanese journalist killed so far.
The lawyers' syndicate has a support rally planned for Monday as well.
Egypt's national security 'red line'
For some observers, this was evidence of Egyptian concerns over a significant influx of Palestinian refugees into Sinai. However, according to local sources, Egypt was not so much concerned with blocking traffic but securing the border, which had been damaged by recent Israeli bombings.
In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said that "the crossing point on the Palestinian side is inoperable due to recent bombings" and that Egypt would evacuate the foreign citizens "in coordination with the embassies" concerned, once the infrastructure is repaired.

The country is also awaiting an agreement with Israel to transport the humanitarian aid.
However, regardless of Egypt's intent, as more Palestinians move towards the Egyptian border, the concentration of people near the Rafah crossing may lead to increased tensions.
There have been calls from within Egypt for the government to open the crossing with Gaza after Israel's order for more than a million of its inhabitants to move to the south near the border. But Cairo has been cautious.
'Egypt's national security is my first responsibility and I will not neglect it under any circumstances,' el-Sisi said on Wednesday.
El-Sisi, who views himself as the natural mediator, has publicly doubted that, should any mass displacement to Egypt take place, the hundreds of thousands of ejected Palestinians would be allowed to return, as has been the case in previous conflicts.
Egypt's National Security Council echoed these sentiments in its meeting on Sunday, where it reaffirmed that its priority is Egypt's national security, saying anything that affected it is a 'red line'.
The government has also clearly stated its "rejection and denunciation of any displacement or liquidation of the Palestinian cause at the expense of neighbouring countries" and proposed a regional summit on 'the development and future of the Palestinian cause'.

A Palestinian armed fighter was shot dead by Israeli forces during a raid on a village near the occupied West Bank town of Nablus, the Palestinian health ministry has said.
Amir Ahmad Khalifa, 27, was shot in the head and in the back after Israeli soldiers stormed the village of Zawata, west of Nablus.
Hewas transferred to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead later.
Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an armed group associated with the Fatah party, claimed Khalifa, who was a resident of the Ein Beit al-Ma' refugee camp, as a member.

The Israeli military said that a Palestinian suspect fired at its troops during a "counterterrorism activity" in Nablus, adding that "hits were identified".
Speaking to the AFP news agency, a family member who requested anonymity for security reasons, said Khalifa was "wanted by Israeli forces for two years and had refused to surrender".

The latest violence in the occupied West Bank has been a continuation of Israel's near-nightly incursions on Palestinian cities and towns, which has corresponded with the rise of armed Palestinian groups in the occupied West Bank.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the beginning of the year, with the United Nations warning that 2023 is on track to be the deadliest year for Palestinians since it started recording fatalities.
At least 27 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis this year.

A third batch of 39 Palestinian prisoners has been freed as the exchange of captives between Hamas and Israel   for a third day under a  .
Large crowds of Palestinians took to the streets in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Sunday night as they waited for Red Cross buses carrying the prisoners.
Some waved Palestinian flags alongside the flags of the two main Palestinian political parties, Hamas and Fatah. Some youth climbed on top of a white bus transporting mostly young men and some female prisoners.
'At first we did not believe it,' Shakir Mahajna told Al Jazeera while he waited with his family for his son Omar, who recently turned 18.
'The last time I visited him he was frustrated, he told me 'Dad I want to leave',' said Mahajna, whose son was 16 when he was arrested and had four months left in his sentence.
'After what happened in October, I was even more scared,' Nour Ara'ar, whose 17-year-old brother Zeid was arrested in July, told Al Jazeera.
'Everything was suspended because of the war,' she added. 'The trial did not take place.'
'We are happy, but we are experiencing mixed feelings. Our joy is incomplete because of what is happening in Gaza,' she added.
Meanwhile, in nearby Beitunia, where some Palestinians had also gathered, three Palestinians aged 15, 18 and 33 were injured after Israeli forces fired live rounds, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said. Two children, aged 11 and 13, were admitted to a hospital for tear-gas inhalation, the PRCS added.
Hamas frees American child, Russian man
Earlier on Sunday, Hamas handed over 13 Israeli captives, including nine children and four foreign nationals – three Thais and one Israeli Russian – to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as part of the truce deal.
The Israeli Russian was released "in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts and in recognition of Russia's position in support of Palestine', Hamas said in a statement. He is the first male captive to be released since the truce deal came into effect.
US President Joe Biden said a four-year-old Israeli-American girl, Abigail Edan, whose parents were killed in the October 7 Hamas attack, was also among those released.
'She's free and she's in Israel,' he said, adding that another dual American citizen – a 45-year-old woman – was also released. Biden also urged the parties to extend the truce deal to allow for more releases.
The exchange of captives was   by a few hours on Saturday after Hamas accused Israel of violating the truce agreement. The standoff sparked concerns that the deal was at risk of derailing.
The impasse was resolved following mediation by Qatar and Egypt.
Around   and 50 civilian captives held in Gaza are to be released over four days under the Israel-Hamas deal.
Israel's ground and air assault on the besieged Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 15,000 Palestinians and left vast swathes of the enclave in ruins.
Netanyahu's 'photo-op' in Gaza
Ahead of Sunday's exchange, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Gaza, the first since the Gaza assault began last month.
'We continue until the end – until victory,' he told soldiers, footage posted online by his office showed.
'Nothing will stop us, and we are convinced that we have the power, the strength, the will and the determination to achieve all the war's goals, and we will.'
Al Jazeera's Imran Khan, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said it wasthe first time an Israeli prime minister entered Gaza since Israel disengaged from the enclave in 2005.
"It is a landmark visit," he said.'We've heard Netanyahu talk about victory but not in this location. This location is what he wants the Israeli public to see,' he added, calling it a "photo-op".
In a statement on Sunday, Hamas said it is seeking to extend the four-day truce with Israel should serious efforts be made to increase the number of Palestinian detainees released from Israeli prisons.
Speaking from Beirut, senior Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera he expected US President Biden to push Israel to end its war on the Gaza Strip.
'President Biden has the ability to make an end to the Israeli offensive against Gaza. He has the power to do that and talking about extending the ceasefire is not the solution.
'The solution is to stop the Israeli attack against Gaza and to force Israel to implement international resolutions regarding the Palestinian people,' he said.

Palestinian killed as Israeli settlers attack West Bank town of Huwara

A Palestinian has been killed when a group of Israeli settlers attacked the town of Huwara, amid a surge in   across the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Labib Dumaidi, 19, was shot in the heart by an Israeli settler, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Friday.
Relatives said he had sought refuge on the roof of his home, which was under assault from settlers, when a settler shot him.
The Israeli military has offered a different account, stating that a suspect was shot after throwing a brick at a vehicle, but offering no details on the victim's identity.
"More than 200 settlers gathered in the middle of Huwara after midnight, shouting and dancing, some of them with covered faces," Palestinian resident Abderrahman Dmidi told the news agency AFP.

"They began throwing stones towards some houses, and then the young people … tried to defend their homes by throwing stones," he added. Residents said Israeli soldiers turned a blind eye to the violence.
"It's clear that the settler militias are protected by the occupation's soldiers," Thaer Qawareeq, an employee at a supermarket damaged by the settlers in Huwara, told the Reuters news agency. He added that it was the third time that settlers had assaulted the store.
The killing of Dumaidi, a university student, has come amid a rise in settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including instances of mob violence targeting Palestinian towns and residents, often in the presence of  . Some of the assaults have followed attacks by Palestinians on Israeli settlements and settlers.
The attack on Friday came a day after a Palestinian gunman shot at an Israeli car in Huwara. The town is located on a road between the Palestinian cities of Nablus and Ramallah and is surrounded by Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.
The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the killing of Dumaidi a 'heinous crime'.
The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that at least 51 Palestinians were injured during a funeral procession for Dumaidi, as Israeli forces fired tear gas,  , and live fire.
Settler violence against Palestinians has seen a   over the last year, occurring at a rate of three per day for the first eight months of 2023, according to the United Nations.
While Palestinian attacks on residents of Jewish settlements often meet harsh countermeasures, accountability from Israeli authorities in cases of settler violence has been rare. Palestinians have said that the impunity is part of a deliberate campaign to push them  .
Huwara itself has been the scene of some of the most notable recent cases of settler violence: following the slaying of two Israeli brothers by a Palestinian in February, a mob of right-wing settlers rampaged  , firing weapons and killing a 37-year-old man.
Israel's far-right Minister of Finance   aroused controversy when he commented that Huwara should be 'wiped out' several days after.

Israel kills at least nine Palestinians in occupied West Bank

November 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli forces have killed at least nine Palestinians and injured dozens more in overnight raids in the occupied West Bank.
At least five were killed in Jenin where the Israeli military blew up the homes of two wanted Palestinians and destroyed at least three monuments in and near the Jenin refugee camp, local sources told Al Jazeera on Friday.
The raid, which is the sixth in the past two weeks on Jenin, started at about 22:00 GMT and lasted about nine hours, the sources said.
The Jenin refugee camp has long been viewed as a bastion of Palestinian resistance, more so in the past two years when fighters started working in tandem to confront the Israeli occupation forces.
In al-Fawwar refugee camp south of Hebron, Israeli forces confronted Palestinians for nearly three hours, killing two people and injuring at least five others, medical sources told Al Jazeera.
Israeli forces detained at least three Palestinians, including the parents of a wanted Palestinian – a tactic they have been using for years, to pressure Palestinians to hand themselves in – according to local sources.
In the Qalandiya refugee camp north of occupied East Jerusalem, one Palestinian was killed and several others were injured in an early morning raid.
Another Palestinian died of wounds he sustained on Wednesday during an Israeli raid on Nablus.
Israeli forces are now raiding Tulkarm and the confrontations are continuing.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and its forces regularly carry out incursions into Palestinian communities there.
Violence in the West Bank has been on the rise since early last year, marked by frequent army raids, attacks by Israeli settlers and Palestinian attacks on Israeli forces and settlers.
More than 140 West Bank Palestinians have been killed since the Gaza war began on October 7 after Hamas fighters stormed over the border killing more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
Since then, Gaza's health ministry says more than 9,000 people have been killed in Israel's bombardment, two-thirds of them women and children.

Two Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli military raid on a refugee camp in the northern occupied West Bank city of Tulkarem, health officials say.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health said two men – Asid Abu Ali, 21, and Abdulrahman Abu Daghash, 32 – were killed by Israeli fire in Sunday's raid, which caused heavy damage to camp infrastructure.
In its comment on the latest bloodshed, the Israeli military said it had gone into the Nour Shams refugee camp to destroy "a militant command centre and bomb-storage facility" in a building.
It said that engineering units detonated several bombs planted under roads and that armed Palestinian fighters opened fire and hurled explosives at the raiding army, causing Israeli troops to respond with live fire.
Earlier in the month, Israeli forces fatally shot   in the headduring a raid on Nour Shams refugee camp.
Deadliest year for Palestinians: UN
Israel has been carrying out  , primarily in the north of the occupied West Bank, for the past 18 months in what it says is a campaign to root out Palestinian resistance fighters and thwart future attacks.
The Israeli army has been militarily occupying the West Bank, where some three million Palestinians live, for 56 years.
In July, Israel launched one of its biggest attacks on the occupied West Bank,   in the Jenin refugee camp and wounding about 100 others.
The raids have shown little sign of slowing the fighting and contributed to the weakening of the Palestinian Authority, the self-ruled administration over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The United Nations has said 2023 is the deadliest year for Palestinians since it started counting deaths in 2006.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the start of this year, according to the Health Ministry. At least 35 Israelis were also killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period.
Tensions spread to Gaza Strip
Over the past week, tensions have begun to spread to the blockaded Gaza Strip, where hundreds of Palestinians have been holding daily demonstrations along the separation fence built by Israel to close it off.
Israel had shut the Beit Hanouna (called Erez by Israel) crossing with Gaza last week in advance of the Rosh Hashanah Jewish holiday, preventing thousands of workers from getting to their jobs in Israel and the occupied West Bank.
Approximately 18,000 Gaza Palestinians have permits from Israeli authorities to work outside the blockaded enclave, providing a vital injection of cash amounting to some $2m daily to the impoverished enclave's economy.

What is the Palestinian Authority and what is its relationship with Israel?

October 11th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Palestinian Authority (PA) is a governing body that has overseen parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank since the mid-'90s. Its creation was supposed to pave the way to an independent Palestinian state, but today it is considered to have little real power and is operating under the control of the Israeli military.
The PA is dominated by Fatah, a secular political party founded by diaspora Palestinians after the 1948 Nakba, or "Catastrophe". Fatah is also the driving force of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), an umbrella organisation comprising several political parties, which claims to represent Palestinians worldwide.
Here's what you need to know about the PA:
When was the PA formed and what was its aim?
The Palestinian Authority (PA) was set up in the mid-'90s as an interim governing body that would pave the way to setting up an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
It was a product of the Oslo Accords between the Israeli government and the PLO – then led by Yasser Arafat. Today, those accords lie in tatters, with Israel expanding its settlements and bypassing roads in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in a de facto annexation of territory that should have been part of the putative state of Palestine. The last round of talks fell apart in 2014.
Are PA members elected?
The PA has an elected presidency and unicameral legislative council (parliament) called the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). However, there have been no presidential elections since incumbent Mahmoud Abbas was elected in 2005, and no parliamentary elections since 2006. The PLC has not convened since 2007, when Abbas's Fatah split from rival group Hamas after a brief civil war. Abbas has ruled by decree ever since.
When his four-year term ended in 2009, Hamas declared Abbas illegitimate. Abbas argued that he should stay in post for a further year, so presidential and parliamentary elections could be held at the same time. To this day, he remains in post.
Who is Abbas?
Abbas, now 87, succeeded archrival Yasser Arafat as president of the PA. Still in mourning for Arafat, Palestinians nevertheless heralded Abbas, also called Abu Mazen, as a reformer who would bring peace.

The arrival of Abbas was also welcomed by Israel and the West, who viewed him as the best guarantor of stability in the region. In contrast to Arafat, Abbas had been critical of violence during the  .
But, according to some, Abbas' victory had been a slam dunk, assisted by alleged restrictions on the movement of rival candidates and ample broadcast coverage.
Just a year later, the PA lost its grip on power after Hamas won parliamentary elections, taking control of the Gaza Strip after a brief civil war. Hamas, which has refused to recognise the state of Israel, had campaigned on an anticorruption and anti-Western platform.

What is the relationship between the PA and Hamas?
Today, the political and territorial split between Abbas's Fatah party and  , seated respectively in the West Bank and Gaza, has become deeply entrenched.
The two territories have grown into markedly different entities, Fatah's PA enjoying international recognition and backing, while Gaza under Hamas, designated terrorists by the West, has grown increasingly isolated. Egypt has helped Israel enforce a land, sea and air blockade on Gaza for the past 17 years.
An attempt in 2014 to set up a National Accord Government uniting the two groups fell apart. Three years later, a reconciliation deal that might have seen Hamas handing over administrative control of Gaza was stymied by disputes about disarmament. In 2022, delegates from 14 Palestinian factions got together in Algiers to sign a new reconciliation deal, with plans to hold parliamentary elections by the end of 2023 - it would have been the first poll in 17 years.
What are the PA's relations with Israel?
In appearance, the PA has all the trappings of a state, with ministries and a civil service, but Israel wields the real power, turning the tap on tax revenue, and controlling access to the shrinking territories - a status quo often compared with the Bantustans of apartheid-era South Africa.
Israel frequently bypasses the PA, invading areas that are supposed to be under PA control, such as the Jenin refugee camp, which was raided three times by Israeli soldiers this year - 20 Palestinians were killed in the violent incursions before fighting between   broke out on Saturday. The Israeli authorities also impose an impossible web of restrictions over all aspects of Palestinian lives, including where they can travel, live and build.
The PA has actively helped Israel to keep tight control over the Palestinian population. Many perceive the body as a tool of the Israeli security apparatus, its US-trained forces not only targeting those suspected of planning attacks on Israelis, but also arresting union figures, journalists and critics on social media.
However, following July's raid on Jenin, the body announced it would cease security cooperation with Israel. Previous attempts to suspend cooperation have not tended to last long. In May 2020, responding to Israeli declarations that it would annex large parts of the West Bank, the PA halted ties with Israeli forces for six months.
Does the PA represent the Palestinian people?
While the PA employs and pays dwindling salaries to tens of thousands of civil servants, it does not enjoy their support. In a poll conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in March, 63 percent of respondents in the West Bank and Gaza viewed the PA as a burden on the Palestinian people.
Many now view Abbas's government as authoritarian, propped up by the likes of the EU and other deeply invested donors who have thrown billions of dollars into keeping his sinking ship afloat. The administration is viewed as irredeemably corrupt - PA bigwigs enjoy VIP status and lifestyles, with travel privileges not afforded to the rest of the population. Its reputation sunk to new lows when Abbas called off elections in 2021, fearing Fatah would be trounced in the poll. Protests erupted after  , an independent candidate, was arrested, and later died in police custody.
Abu Mazen is one of the last surviving members of an iconic age of Palestinian resistance. While gifted with the diplomatic skills that yielded the Oslo Accords, it appears that his legitimacy has been sacrificed on the altar of political survival.

Amid Gaza war, activists in Argentina aim to expel Israeli water company

November 24th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Buenos Aires, Argentina - The upscale neighbourhood of Recoleta was pulsing with the sound of drums and chanting last month, as protesters gathered outside the Palestinian embassy in Buenos Aires to call for an end to Israel's war in Gaza.
But amid the sea of Palestinian flags, Silvia Ferreyra gripped a different symbol of solidarity. Above her head, she held a banner depicting a blue ribbon of water trapped behind a lock and chain. Printed above the picture in large red type was the phrase, "Fuera Mekorot".
Ferreyra, 52, had a simple message. She wanted  , Israel's state-run water company, out of Argentina.
Since September 2022, seven Argentinian provinces have signed wide-ranging agreements granting Mekorot significant influence over how they allocate water resources.
Yet, with Israel drawing outcry for its deadly military campaign in Gaza, Argentinian activists are looking to leverage the public attention to pressure the government into cutting ties with the company.
'We are trying to [spread] the information that this is not only something completely foreign to our country, but that in our country there is a business causing conflict in Palestine,' said Ferreyra, a longtime organiser who works in the Argentinian Chamber of Deputies's environmental commission.
Mekorot's future in Argentina cannot be evaluated 'without taking into account the current situation and the context of the conflict there in the Gaza Strip', she added.
'We have to discuss the origins of this conflict more deeply.'

Controlling Palestinian water resources
Though widely seen as a world leader in water management technology, Mekorot has drawn   for its policies in Gaza and the West Bank. It has   in the two Palestinian territories since Israel occupied them in 1967.
Though not directly named, the company's activities were referenced in a 2022 report  by United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights Michael Lynk, which accused Israel of implementing   against Palestinians.
The report identified access to water as a major source of inequality.
'The utilities and services which the [Israeli] settlements enjoy — water, power, housing, access to well-paid jobs, roads and industrial investment — are far superior to those available to the Palestinians,' it explained.
The Israeli nonprofit B'Tselem also blamed 'Israel's deliberately discriminatory' policies for   in the West Bank.
In an April report , B'Tselem found that only 36 percent of Palestinians in the area had running water throughout the year. There were also wide discrepancies in water usage.
Israeli settlers in the West Bank consumed an average of 247 litres (65 gallons) of water per capita each day, while Palestinians used just 82.4 (21 gallons) — limiting their ability to meet their basic needs for hydration, hygiene, sanitation and everyday chores.
'To make up for the shortage, the Palestinian Authority is forced to purchase water from Israel's national water company, Mekorot, at a much higher cost,' the report explained.
When Israel began its military campaign last month, it used Mekorot to cut the water supply to Gaza completely, forcing residents to drink polluted water. Hospitals, meanwhile, were left without proper sanitation.
'Israel is using its strategic control over water resources on the one hand, and water distribution on the other, as a geopolitical tool and does so in highly unequal ways,' said Erik Swyngedouw, a geographer at the University of Manchester who researches the intersection of water and politics.
Mekorot did not respond to a request for comment about its humanitarian record in Gaza and the West Bank, nor about concerns over its expansion in Argentina.

International backlash
The accusations that Mekorot   to the oppression of Palestinians have prompted some groups to sever ties with the Israeli water company over the past decade.
In the Netherlands, the water company Vitens announced in 2013 that it would end relations with Mekorot after consulting with the Dutch foreign ministry. The next year, in Portugal, EPAL — the company that provides water to the city of Lisbon — likewise ended a technology exchange deal over Mekorot's actions in the Palestinian territories.
And in 2014, the Argentinian province of Buenos Aires scrapped a deal with the company to build a desalination plant after public protests.
However, Mekorot continues to enjoy partnerships around the world. Its projects range from a water system in Mexico to a desalination plant in Morocco.
Further support comes from Argentinian governmental institutions, including the Ministry of the Interior. In February, Interior Minister Eduardo de Pedro led the country's national water authority and a public-private investment body in signing agreements to transfer control over water administration in multiple provinces to Mekorot.
With the world's sixth-largest Jewish population, Argentina has traditionally been an ally of Israel, and the countries maintain strong bilateral relations through institutions like the Argentine-Israeli Chamber of Commerce.
As Argentina faces a historic drought, government officials have praised Mekorot for its efficiency and technological prowess, with Interior Minister de Pedro saying that Israel offers an 'example' for 'managing a resource as scarce as water'.

Water as a commodity
Yet organisers of 'Fuera Mekorot' — the movement to expel Mekorot from Argentina — are concerned about the impact the company might have on the country.
Marta Maffei, a former deputy in the National Congress, is among those who oppose Mekorot's expansion in Argentina. She has advocated for a law to protect water access as a basic human right.
'Why should a state enterprise that manages water as a form of social control come to Argentina?' Maffei said. 'In our territories, there are also Indigenous peoples, there are poor peasant communities, who demand their water.'
Maffei's home province of Rio Negro signed an agreement with Mekorot in February to transfer a number of responsibilities to the company, including calculating the 'economic value' of water and drafting a proposal for an authority to regulate drinking water and sanitation services.
The area is already a hotspot for fracking, an industry that uses large amounts of water to extract oil and natural gas, and clashes have erupted between local groups and police over water access.
Mekorot's representatives have indicated they would approach water as a commodity to finance future growth, a prospect that has alarmed some advocates.
'The water bill has to cover all costs plus the costs of future investment,' Diego Berger, Mekorot's international coordinator for special projects, said in a March interview with the YouTube channel Alterrados.
The commodification of water resources, however, comes with risks, according to Swyngedouw, the Manchester University geographer.
It could have 'profound negative social [and] ecological consequences for small peasants, Indigenous people and others who depend on water access for their livelihoods', he said.
A business-based approach to water access also threatens to conflict with traditional Indigenous views.
'From the Western perspective, [water] is called a 'resource',' said Miriam Liempe, the Indigenous relations secretary for the Argentine Workers' Central Union and a member of the Fuera Mekorot coalition.
'However, [Indigenous] peoples call it a brother, like something that has life — like the trees, like the birds.'
A member of the  , Liempe said what worries her most about Mekorot is what she calls the company's failure to consult Indigenous groups when planning water management projects.
If projects like diverting rivers lead to the   of  , Liempe said they could violate international law.
According to the International Labor Organization's 1989 Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, Indigenous peoples 'shall not be removed from the lands which they occupy', and any attempt at relocation requires 'free and informed consent' from the groups involved.

Organising against Mekorot
As Mekorot continues to make advances in Argentina, Ferreyra said her organisation's biggest obstacle has been a general lack of awareness among Argentinian people. After the war in Gaza broke out, she and other activists held a series of events about Mekorot's activities in Argentina.
'We have been in a process of trying to establish an awareness of what Mekorot is,' Ferreyra said. 'It's not a very well-known company.'
Hasan Najjar, an Argentinian who was born in Gaza, said he only found out about Mekorot's presence in Argentina when he attended a protest where Fuera Mekorot organisers were present. But the company's actions did not surprise him.
'They have experience against Indigenous people, in killing us slowly, like with food and water or with bombs,' Najjar said.
Silvia Muñoz, who works at a food kitchen in the suburbs of Buenos Aires, said she heard about Mekorot for the first time at a panel discussion in the city's historic San Telmo neighbourhood.
'It's a business for them, but a mafia business,' Muñoz said. 'It makes me concerned.'
Ferreyra believes she has made progress in raising awareness of Mekorot's presence in Argentina. But she has no illusions that blocking the company's business ambitions will be easy.
'We know that this is not something simple, because we understand the involvement and weight that Israel has in a lot of aspects that make up the economic life of our country,' Ferreyra said. 'We still have a lot to do.'

'From the river to the sea': What does the Palestinian slogan really mean?

A slogan calling for freedom from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea has drawn scrutiny after   across the Western world were met with attempts to curtail its use.
From Beirut to London, from Tunis to Rome, calls for a ceasefire ending Israel's relentless bombing of Gaza were interspersed with the slogan: 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.'
To the crowds waving Palestinian flags, the chant reverberating across the globe expresses the desire for freedom from oppression across the historical land of Palestine. But for Israel and its backers, who label the phrase as pro-Hamas, it is a veiled call to violence that bears an anti-Semitic charge.
The United Kingdom's Labour Party on Monday suspended Member of Parliament Andy McDonald for using the phrase "between the river and the sea" in a speech at a  .
Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman described pro-Palestinian demonstrations as 'hate marches' and warned that the slogan should be interpreted as an indication of a violent desire for the elimination of Israel.
The Football Association in the UK has banned players from using the slogan on their private social media accounts.
Austrian police took a similar stance, banning a pro-Palestine protest on the basis of the chant and claiming that the slogan, originally formulated by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), had been adopted by the armed group Hamas. German authorities declared the slogan forbidden and indictable and called on schools in the capital, Berlin, to ban the use of keffiyehs, the Palestinian scarf.
The slogan has previously drawn a sharp reaction in the West. In 2018, journalist Marc Lamont Hill was   for calling for Palestinian freedom 'from the river to the sea'.
Here is what you should know about the controversy:
What are the origins of the slogan?
Upon its creation by diaspora Palestinians in 1964 under the leadership of Yasser Arafat, the PLO called for the establishment of a single state that extend from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea to encompass its historic territories.
The debate over partition predates the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. A plan put forward a year earlier by the United Nations to divide the territory into a Jewish state - occupying 62 percent of the former British mandate - and a separate Palestinian state was rejected by Arab leaders at the time.
More than 750,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes in what became known as the  , or "catastrophe".
The PLO leadership later accepted the prospect of a two-state solution, but the failure of the Oslo peace process in 1993 and of United States attempts to broker a final deal at Camp David in 2000 leading up to a second Intifada, the mass Palestinian uprising, have since resulted in a hardening of attitudes.
What does it mean?
To Palestinian and Israeli observers alike, different interpretations over the meaning of the slogan hang on the term 'free'.
Nimer Sultany, a lecturer in law at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, said the adjective expresses 'the need for equality for all inhabitants of historic Palestine'.
'Those who support apartheid and Jewish supremacy will find the egalitarian chant objectionable,' Sultany, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, told Al Jazeera.
Freedom here refers to the fact that Palestinians have been denied the realisation of their right to self-determination since Britain granted the Jews the right to establish a national homeland in Palestine through the Balfour Declaration of 1917.
'This continues to be the crux of the problem: the ongoing denial of Palestinians to live in equality, freedom and dignity like everyone else,' Sultany said.
Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through a rainy London on Saturday accompanied by several Jewish groups, which according to the SOAS lecturer was a sign that the slogan could not be interpreted to be anti-Semitic.
'It's important to remember this chant is in English and it doesn't rhyme in Arabic, it is used in demonstrations in Western countries,' he said. 'The controversy has been fabricated to prevent solidarity in the West with the Palestinians.'
Pro-Israel observers, however, argue the slogan has a chilling effect. 'To Jewish Israelis what this phrase says is that between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, there will be one entity, it will be called Palestine - there will be no Jewish state - and the status of Jews in whatever entity arises will be very unclear,' Yehudah Mirsky, a Jerusalem-based rabbi and professor of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at Brandeis University.
'It sounds much more like a threat than a promise of liberation. It doesn't betoken a future in which Jews can have full lives and be themselves,' he said, adding that the slogan made it more difficult for left-wing Israelis to advocate for dialogue.
Mirsky argued that those who chant the slogan are 'supporters of Hamas', while Sultany claimed that those waving the green flag of the armed movement were the exception at the thousands-strong protests.
The controversy on Monday reached as far as the British parliament, when the Labour Party removed McDonald from office for saying: "We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty."
The party claimed the British MP had uttered "deeply offensive" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. McDonald rebuffed the accusations, saying his words were intended as "a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings" in the region, according to local media reports.
Sultany saw the dynamic at play as "an attempt by Zionists and pro-Israeli propagandists to collapse the distinction between the existence of Israel as a state and the ideological apparatus of Jewish supremacy". Through this distorted lens, "a call for egalitarianism and for the dismantlement of the system of apartheid becomes an existential threat".
Israel's use of 'from the river to the sea'
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, which describes itself as conservative and nationalist, has been a staunch promoter of the concept of 'Eretz Israel', or the Bible-given right of the Jewish people to the land of Israel.
According to the Jewish Virtual Library, the party's original party manifesto in 1977 stated that 'between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty'. It also argued that the establishment of a Palestinian state 'jeopardises the security of the Jewish population' and 'endangers the existence of the state of Israel'.
Israel's ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, has been among the promoters of international recognition of the Jewish historic claim to lands from the river to the sea.
The expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem by successive Israeli governments is seen as an attempt by Israel to control the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, denying Palestinians' aspiration for an independent state.
Mirsky, of Brandeis University, said that while Israeli public figures were using the biblical concept to claim political authority over all disputed territories, the issue was 'hotly debated' within modern Israel.
Rather than focus on what sows division, Mirsky said "efforts should instead be directed towards finding solutions'.
'Let's sit down and can we come up with ideas that practically will make life better for Jews and Arabs?' he said, including a new slogan that bridges the current divide.
'As outlandish as this sounds, I do think that at the end of this war, there will be a new opportunity to talk about creating a better future.'

BBC accused of censoring acts of Gaza solidarity in BAFTA awards coverage

November 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Glasgow, Scotland - The BBC has been accused of editing out multiple calls for a ceasefire in Gaza in its coverage of an entertainment awards ceremony in Scotland.
The Scottish arm of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) held its ceremony on Sunday in Glasgow.
At the event, some public figures used their moment on stage to express solidarity with Palestinians from the besieged enclave.
But they later found their words of support cut from the final edit of the show, which appeared on the British public service broadcaster's streaming service, iPlayer.
Among those to accuse the BBC of censorship was director Eilidh Munro, who prevailed in BAFTA Scotland's best Short Film and Animation category.
She used her acceptance speech to call on guests to 'use your voice as filmmakers and artists' to lobby for a halt to Israel's bombardment of Gaza, as her colleague Finlay Pretsell displayed a poster that read, 'I refuse to be silent. Ceasefire now.'
While Munro's entire award-winning segment, which included her acceptance speech, was seen by viewers watching the livestream version produced by BAFTA Scotland, it was not included in the final BBC iPlayer edit.
Munro told Scotland's The National newspaper: "It is deeply concerning that the BBC decided to cut the entire segment of our award acceptance speech from their coverage of the BAFTA Scotland Awards.
"It is also somewhat surreal that an event which celebrates artists and filmmakers for using their voices and creating work to speak out against injustice can also be censored."
She added to The National: "In my opinion, the BBC's editorial decision to omit these peaceful signs of solidarity is neither neutral nor impartial."
Apparently this was cut from the BBC coverage of the awards. Doubt they'd have done that if he was talking about Ukraine! https://t.co/idXBGWJepa
- Hanna Ines Flint – Free (@HannaFlint) November 21, 2023
 
Pretsell's poster is understood to have come from the campaigners who had gathered outside the ceremony's venue at a Glasgow hotel.
Art Workers for Palestine Scotlandhanded out pro-Palestinian paraphernalia to attendees, including Scotland's Muslim First Minister Humza Yousaf.
Yousaf was seen at the event with his Scottish-Palestinian wife Nadia El-Nakla, whose parents escaped Gaza after becoming trapped in the Palestinian territory for weeks after the start of the bloody conflict.
Social media users outraged by the BBC edits have been sharing a video clip by the popular American TikTok user YourFavoriteGuy, who alleged the British broadcaster does not care 'about [the Gazan] genocide or the Palestinians'.
More than 14,500 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli air strikes in a matter of weeks. Israel's bombardment began in retaliation for the Hamas attack on southern Israel nearly 50 days ago, during which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage.
A   is hoped to take hold early on Friday.
A BBC spokesperson told Al Jazeera that "the programme on iPlayer is a highlights show and therefore significantly shorter than the actual event itself'.
The spokesperson added: "Some edits were made so the content was compliant with BBC editorial guidelines on impartiality.'
According to those rules, which are published on the BBC's website, the broadcaster "must be inclusive, considering the broad perspective and ensuring that the existence of a range of views is appropriately reflected. It does not require absolute neutrality on every issue or detachment from fundamental democratic principles, such as the right to vote, freedom of expression and the rule of law".

Pro-Israel rallies allowed in India but Palestine solidarity sees crackdown

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
New Delhi, India – Israel's   of the besieged Gaza Strip and killing of nearly 6,000 people – a third of them children – in two weeks has outraged people across the world, triggering mass protests and a call for an immediate ceasefire.
However, in India – the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), but now seen closer to Israel and its biggest benefactor, the United States – some pro-Palestine protesters reported being targeted by the government.
Less than a week after the Gaza assault began, police in Hamirpur district of India's most populous Uttar Pradesh state were looking for Muslim scholars Atif Chaudhary and Suhail Ansari. Their alleged crime: putting a WhatsApp display photo that said: "I stand with Palestine."
The two men were charged with promoting enmity between social groups. Ansari is under arrest, while Chaudhary is on the run, according to the police.

In the same state, governed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), four students of the Aligarh Muslim University were booked by the police after they took out a pro-Palestine march on the campus a day after the Gaza assault began on October 7.
However, when the Hindu far-right group Bajrang Dal took out a pro-Israel march in the same Aligarh city, raising slogans such as 'Down with Palestine, Down with Hamas', no action was taken against them by the authorities.
'As if I have committed some crime'
In the national capital, New Delhi, there have been several examples of people being detained during rallies organised by student groups, activists and citizens for solidarity with the Palestinians since October 7.
In the western state of Maharashtra, also governed by the BJP in alliance with a regional party, two protesters, Ruchir Lad and Supreeth Ravish, were arrested on October 13 for holding a march against the war on Gaza and charged with unlawful assembly.
Pooja Chinchole, member of the Revolutionary Workers Party of India and one of the organisers of the protest held in state capital Mumbai, told Al Jazeera the police "created many hurdles before us when they got to know that we are organising a pro-Palestine protest".
"They detained one of the organisers a day before the protest and three organisers on the morning of the protest. When we still gathered to protest, they snatched our microphone, placards, and after a while, started using force on some of us,' she said.

The crackdown, however, was not limited to the BJP-ruled states only.
In the southern Karnataka state, governed by the main opposition Congress party, police charged 10 activists with creating a public nuisance after they organised a silent march in support of the Palestinians on October 16 in Bengaluru, the capital of the state.
The Karnataka police also arrested a 58-year-old Muslim man for allegedly posting a video in support of Hamas on WhatsApp. Police also briefly detained Alam Nawaz, a Muslim government employee, for updating his WhatsApp status with a Palestinian flag and "Long Live Palestine" message.
"People started seeing me with suspicion as if I have committed some crime by expressing my solidarity with Palestinian people," Nawaz, 20, told Al Jazeera.
All this despite the Congress expressing its support for the 'rights of the Palestinian people to land, self-government and to live with dignity' as the party called for an immediate ceasefire in a resolution passed by its working committee on October 9.
'Israel fighting proxy war on behalf of Hindus'
Meanwhile, pro-Israel rallies, organised mainly by  , were seen across India, while many on social media offered their services to the Israeli forces.
On Saturday, dozens of supporters of a retired Indian army soldier travelled 182km (113 miles) to reach the Israeli embassy in New Delhi where they offered to go to Israel to fight against the Palestinians in Gaza.
Last week, one of India's most influential Hindu nationalists, Yati Narsinghanand, released a video in which he said Hindus and Jews "have the same enemy: Muhammad and his satanic book" as he urged the Israeli government to allow 1,000 Hindus to settle in Israel in order to "take on those Muslims".
Israel's ambassador to India, Naor Gilon, on October 8 said he had received several requests from Indians wanting to voluntarily fight for Israel.
Apoorvanand, professor of Hindi language at Delhi University, told Al Jazeera he was not surprised that the Hindu far right, which openly admires Adolf Hitler for his action against the Jews, is now supporting the Zionists in Israel.
'Hindu far-right organisations in India have always supported those who dominate by violence. Hitler did once, so they supported him. Now Israel is doing this, so they are supporting it,' he said.

Apoorvanand said the Hindu right in India thinks there are ideological linkages between them and the Zionists in Israel.
'It looks like Israel is fighting a proxy war on behalf of the Hindu far right. They think Israel is fighting and decimating Muslims on their behalf. The way they want to establish Akhand Bharat [Unified India] by joining Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal together with India, they think Israel is following the same expansionist ideology,' he said.
This was not always the case.
India-Israel ties and Palestine struggle
India's foreign policy has historically supported the Palestinian cause, which began with India voting against the United Nations resolution to create the state of Israel in 1947 and then recognising the PLO as a representative of the Palestinian people in 1974.
India's pro-Palestine stand was guided by the shared history of colonisation by the British, Zikrur Rahman, former Indian ambassador to Palestine, told Al Jazeera.
"In the postcolonial era, we identified that this is a colonial attempt to divide the country and to create another country. We were not in favour of the creation of a country on the basis of religion," he said.
Rahman, however, added that while India's position on Palestine has not changed, it is not as strong as it used to be.
India recognised the creation of Israel in 1950, but did not establish diplomatic relations until 1992, when the details of the first   were being finalised. Since then, India has tried to strike a balance between its strategic relations with Israel and sympathising with the Palestinian struggle.
Today, India is the largest buyer of Israeli-made weapons, while strategic and security cooperation between them has grown manifold. Comparisons have also been made between Israel demolishing homes of Palestinians in the occupied territories and a similar policy adopted by some BJP state governments   as forms of "collective punishment" of the community.
Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, he has made public statements, calling his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu a "good friend" on several occasions.
Modi was one of the first global leaders to post his solidarity with Israel after Hamas's unprecedented incursion on October 7. 'Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel,' said his post on X, which came four hours before US President Joe Biden reacted to the event.
Modi also condemned the Israeli attack on   in Gaza on October 18, in which nearly 500 Palestinians were killed, though his message on X appeared nearly eight hours after Biden's post.
Meanwhile, India's Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement on October 12, reiterating New Delhi's position of establishing a "sovereign, independent, and viable state of Palestine, living within secure and recognised borders, side by side at peace with Israel".
Last week, Modi posted on X about his phone call with the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, in which he repeated India's "longstanding principled position on the Israel-Palestine issue". He said his government is sending humanitarian assistance for the besieged residents of Gaza.
Journalist Anand K Sahay, however, thinks India's response to the unfolding humanitarian disaster in Gaza has not been adequate.
'What India didn't say is important. India didn't demand a ceasefire. Historically, India has always demanded a ceasefire in case of a [foreign] war. In this case also we should have strongly said: stop the war,' he told Al Jazeera.
Sahay said Modi's flaunting of closeness with Israel is also aimed at appeasing his core vote bank: the Hindus.
'Suppose there was another religion in majority in Palestine. Then our stand may have been different. During the Russia-Ukraine war, we said 'this is not an age of war'. Why couldn't we say this in case of Israel-Palestine war?' asked Sahay.
"By not asking for a ceasefire, India was also indirectly signalling the US that the Indian position was very close to the US line."

'Horrifying': Dozens reported killed in Israeli attacks on camps, schools

Israeli air raids have killed dozens of people, including children, in northern, central, and southern Gaza, Palestinian officials and media have said, as the besieged territory endures its   of bombardment.
At least 31 people were killed in Israeli attacks on the Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps in central Gaza, the Ministry of Health in the Hamas-governed enclave said on Sunday.
A woman and her child were also killed in strikes in southern Khan Younis city, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
Israeli forces also shot dead two people, including a disabled man, during incursions in the occupied West Bank, Wafa reported.
Issam al-Fayed, a 46-year-old disabled man, was killed at the entrance of the Jenin refugee camp, while 20-year-old Omar Laham was killed at the Dheisheh refugee camp south of Bethlehem, Wafa said.
'Our life is hell'
The killings come on the heels of   on schools and refugee camps in northern Gaza.
At least 50 people were killed in an attack on al-Fakhoora school in the Jabalia refugee camp on Saturday, Gaza's Health Ministry said, while dozens of casualties were reported from an attack on a second school in Tall az-Zaatar.
'The scenes were horrifying. Corpses of women and children were on the ground. Others were screaming for help,' Ahmed Radwan, a wounded survivor of al-Fakhoora attack, told The Associated Press news agency.
"Dead bodies [are] scattered … pieces of flesh', an unnamed witness told Al Jazeera. 'No one can recognise their sons. Our life is hell.'
Marwan Bishara, a senior political analyst for Al Jazeera, said al-Fakhoora school could be described as the 'al-Shifa of schools' as it has been repeatedly hit by Israeli forces like al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest medical facility, which has been a major target of Israel's military campaign.
'There is nothing discriminate about the fact that a school that shelters thousands of people has been bombed from the air; that is meant to create damage, human loss, suffering and death,' Bishara said.
Patients fleeing al-Shifa
Meanwhile,   continued to be the focus of humanitarian concerns as hundreds of people fled the facility on foot on orders from the Israeli army, according to its director.
Columns of sick and injured – some of them amputees – were seen leaving with displaced people, doctors, and nurses on Saturday, as loud explosions were heard around the complex.
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, described "horrifying images" of the scene, while Egypt called the bombing a "war crime" and "a deliberate insult to the United Nations".
A World Health Organization assessment team on Sunday said 291 patients were left at the hospital. They included 32 babies in extremely critical condition, trauma patients with severely infected wounds and others with spinal injuries who are unable to move, the UN health agency said.
Since Palestinian group Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israeli territory on October 7, Israel has waged a devastating air and ground assault on Gaza,   at least 11,500 people, more than a third of them children, according to Gaza officials.
The 44-day war has displaced some 1.5 million Palestinians, wrecked much of the territory's infrastructure and sparked a desperate humanitarian crisis, aid workers say.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis bans pro-Palestine student organisation

Florida Governor   has banned a pro-Palestine student group from university campuses in the state as tensions rise in the United States over the Israel-Gaza war.
The State University System of Florida said on Tuesday that it would dismantle chapters of the group Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) due to the group's 'support for terrorist groups'.
"Based on the National SJP's support of terrorism, in consultation with Governor DeSantis, the student chapters must be deactivated," the system's chancellor, Ray Rodrigues, wrote in a memo to university leaders.
The SJP denounced the move and said DeSantis "continues to disrespect American values, such as freedom of speech".
'To bend the law in this manner shows the utmost disrespect not only to any pro-Palestinian organization but also to anyone who truly cares for political freedom and freedom of speech,' it said.
Tensions have risen on some US university campuses since the Palestinian armed group Hamas's October 7 attacks in southern Israel and Israel's subsequent siege and bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
As Israel continues its assault on Gaza, there are growing concerns among Muslim, Arab and Jewish groups in the US that tensions could   into their own communities.
Palestinian activists have described an atmosphere of hostility and  . Jewish communities across the US have also described an uptick in anti-Semitic incidents since the fighting began.
Florida is the first state in the country to ban the SJP, which the state accused of throwing its support behind Hamas after the October 7 attacks. More than 1,400 people, many of them civilians, were killed in the attacks, according to Israeli officials. More than 6,500 Palestinians, most of the civilians, have been killed in Israel's bombardment of Gaza.
The National SJP called the Hamas attacks a "historic win for the Palestinian resistance", drawing criticism and accusations of condoning attacks on civilians.
Based on its social media presence, the SJP appears to have branches at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville and Florida State University in Tallahassee.
DeSantis, a candidate for the Republican Party's   who currently trails former President Donald Trump by a wide margin in polls, has previously stated that all Palestinians are anti-Semitic and Palestinian refugees should not be allowed into the United States.
He has also expressed support for Israel's decision to cut off food, water, electricity and fuel supplies for the more than 2.3 million residents of the besieged Gaza Strip, which Israel has continuously   since the attacks by Hamas.
The governor has also proposed new legislation in Florida to expand existing prohibitions on conducting business with Iranian companies, 'ensuring Florida does not do business with companies aligned with Iran or Hamas'.
Members of the Arab and Muslim community in the US have expressed fear that as fighting in the Middle East dominates the headlines, they could face a greater risk of  .
"Basically, it's kind of like you have to prove that you're not a terrorist," Aya Hijazi, a US social justice activist with Middle Eastern parents, previously told the Agence France-Presse news agency.
This month, a Palestinian American boy named   was stabbed to death and his mother wounded in Illinois. The suspected attacker, 71-year-old Joseph Czuba, has been charged with murder and hate crimes.

Celtic fans defy club to fly Palestine flags in Champions League match

  defied their club's directives and waved thousands of Palestine flags during their team's UEFA Champions League match against Atletico Madrid.
The Scottish Premiership champions hosted the Spanish club for their group-stage match at Glasgow's Celtic Park on Wednesday.
Hours ahead of the match, the club issued a statement saying both teams' players and coaching staff would wear black armbands "as a show of respect and support for all those affected by the conflict [between Israel and Palestine]," but told fans to refrainfrom displaying their support in the stands.
"We ask that banners, flags and symbols relating to the conflict and those countries involved in it are not displayed at Celtic Park at this time," the club said in its statement.
However, fans paid no heed to the directives and held up thousands of Palestine flags ahead of kickoff and continued to wave them during the match.

Fans at the North Curve section of the stadium prepared a tifo - a choreographed display - of the Palestine flag and unfurled large flags behind the home team's goal during the first half of the match.
Several thousand fans in other parts of the stadium held up a sea of smaller flags as they sang along to the famous football anthem "You'll Never Walk Alone" and shouted slogans in support of Palestine before the match got under way.
The Green Brigade, an ultras group of hardcore Celtic fans, had encouraged supporters to defy the club's statement and continue their display of solidarity with the Palestinians.

'Fly the flag for Palestine'
Celtic have banned the group from attending their team's away matches until further notice after their 'unsafe and unacceptable behaviour' at recent matches away to Motherwell and Feyenoord.
The group said hundreds of fans were suspended from attending away matches "due to an association with the Green Brigade; despite receiving no correspondence, no allegations, nor any detail regarding any investigatory process".
" Despite disingenuous claims, we have absolutely no doubt that these sanctions are motivated by a desire to quash political expression within the Celtic support, specifically in relation to Palestine at this time," the group said in its statement on Tuesday.
"In spite of this, and any further obstruction, we once again encourage fans to courageously fly the flag for Palestine."
Celtic were handed a fine by UEFA over their fans' use of flares during their match at Feyenoord last month, and could face another fine over last night's display of solidarity with Palestine.
Earlier this month, Celtic's board distanced itself from the group after they displayed banners saying 'Free Palestine' and 'Victory to the resistance!!' during the Scottish Premiership match against Kilmarnock in Glasgow on October 7.
'Out of touch with what matters'
Fans slammed the club and said the display of support on Wednesday came from "a large section" of the supporters and not the Green Brigade alone.

- Joe Miller (@joe_averagejoe) October 25, 2023
Others criticised the club's actions, saying they were "out of touch with what matters" and continued to display their solidarity.
Paul Doherty - a politician from Northern Ireland - posted a photo of himself holding up the flag at Celtic Park on X, formerly Twitter.
"Standing with 60,000 Celtic supporters tonight showing solidarity with the people of Palestine," he wrote in the post.

'Solidarity with Palestine': British protesters defy curbs to hit streets

October 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Glasgow, United Kingdom — Dozens of young British trade unionists blocked access into Instro Precision Ltd – a subsidiary of Elbit Systems which manufactures Israeli military apparatus – on Thursday in protest at Israel's continuing bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
The rally, which began in the early morning at the company's site in Kent, southeast England, saw more than 100 teachers, academics, healthcare providers and others unfurl giant banners reading 'Workers For A Free Palestine' and 'UK: Stop Arming Israel'.
Demonstrations opposing the deadly campaign of Israeli air strikes – which were launched in response to the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel and which have killed more than 7,000 Gaza residents, including 3,000 children – have swept Britain in recent weeks.
But, from small gatherings to much larger rallies in cities including Glasgow, Manchester and London, where some 100,000 pro-Palestinian activists marched in the British capital on October 21, voices condemning Israel have had to contend with a UK government which has pledged its unwavering support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
'They are supporting a genocide'
'There's no doubt that the British government and the Western media generally are very complicit in what's happening in Gaza,' Jeanine Hourani, who was representing the Palestinian Youth Movement on the mass picket at Instro Precision Ltd, told Al Jazeera. 'They are supporting a genocide that is unfolding there.'
Indeed, the British state – which during the first world war publicly promised to establish 'a national home for the Jewish people' in its   1917 Balfour Declaration – has so far refused to act on overwhelming calls by UK activists to pressure Israel to cease its brutal shelling of Gaza.
Echoing the likes of US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak   to support Israel's right to retaliate against Hamas, which killed some 1,400 Israelis during its attack earlier this month.
But on Tuesday, Amnesty International, which deems Israel an apartheid state on account of its occupation of the West Bank and its blockade of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, accused Israel of 'indiscriminate attacks, which caused mass [Palestinian] civilian casualties and must be investigated as war crimes'.
'It's very difficult to determine exactly what impact [these protests] are having on the British government,' Chris Doyle, director of the London-based Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU), told Al Jazeera.
'What we are seeing is a slight shift in the language [of the British government] to acknowledge more the humanitarian suffering in Gaza. What we are not seeing is a call to end the siege or any criticism of the Israeli actions in Gaza where they have been targeting civilian facilities such as schools, bakeries, hospitals and water installations,' he added.
Carrie Harper, a Welsh county councillor and pro-Palestinian campaigner, maintained that British 'public backlash' had forced the Conservative Party government into this tonal shift, but, like Doyle, lamented that the 'overall position remained unchanged'.
'There is no balanced view being taken, there is no call for a ceasefire, and I find it incredibly saddening that [the UK government] is incapable of calling for peace,' she added. 'It shows an incredible lack of leadership.'

Crucial legacy of protest
But why has the UK government – faced with hundreds of thousands of pro-Palestinian activists calling for an end to the Israeli attacks on an already impoverished enclave – taken little apparent heed of this very public show of opposition to its stance?
Seasoned pro-Palestinian activist Ben Jamal, the director of the London-based Palestine Solidarity Campaign, conceded that 'large-scale protests' rarely had an immediate effect on changing government policy.
But he added: 'You need to recognise that you are building a movement for change.'
Jamal was one of the 1.5 million people who marched in London in February 2003 against the looming war in Iraq. He told Al Jazeera that, despite failing to dissuade then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair from joining the US in its invasion of the Iraqi state, the rally left behind a crucial legacy of protest.
'Within what happened in the aftermath – the fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction [found in Iraq] and the chaos that ensued – there was a manifestation of a movement that had marched [in Britain] that was able to say that the lessons from this need to be taken forward,' said the British Palestinian.
Dismissed as 'an intimidating mob'
But many British pro-Palestinian campaigners worry that their right to even protest is under threat. During the early days of the Gaza conflict, for instance, UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman wrote to the chief constables of England and Wales urging them to crack down on certain shows of support for Palestinians. And on October 16 she took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice her opposition to pro-Palestinian protesters, whom she described as 'an intimidating mob', chanting 'from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free'.
'The slogan was taken up by Islamists, including Hamas, and remains a staple of anti-Semitic discourse,' she claimed.
But with more pro-Palestinian rallies planned in the coming days, including another in London on October 28, UK activists have promised to stand shoulder to shoulder with a people who have faced the full might of Israeli military hardware for the past three weeks.
'[These protests send] a fundamentally important message of solidarity to the Palestinian people,' said Jamal. 'That, in the UK and elsewhere, there are huge bodies of people who do not share the views of their leadership and who are pushing for change.'

'Olive branches, victory signs': How Oslo Accords failed the Palestinians

On September 13, 1993, Saadeh Ersheid recalled being among dozens of people strolling the streets of Jenin in the occupied West Bank.
Many cheered and flashed victory signs while others were left perplexed at the news coming out of the United States.
Palestinian leaders had just officially recognised Israel's existence as a legitimate state, hoping that, in turn, they would be able to establish their own.
Televisions in the homes of millions of Palestinians showed the moment Palestinian Liberation Organisation leader Yasir Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands outside the White House, marking the end of months-long negotiations that culminated in the signing of the Oslo Accords.
'I remember seeing a group of young men rush over to an Israeli army vehicle, grasping and climbing onto it to place olive branches on its hood,' 68-year-old Ersheid, a writer and political analyst, told Al Jazeera.
'The scene amused Israeli soldiers, who scorned and ridiculed the young men.'

The so-called peace deal came after years of a crippling financial crisis within the PLO, and after the brutal Israeli suppression of Palestinian resistance. It marked the end of the first Intifada, or uprising, in which more than 1,000 Palestinians were killed.
Many Palestinians were in a 'state of misery', Ersheid recalled, until the US-brokered accords were announced.
'Oslo was presented to them as a victory, or at least, as a helping hand to save them from this bad situation,' he said.
The second part of the accords were signed in 1995, with the aim of kick-starting talks with a two-state solution as the objective; specifically an independent Palestinian state through the establishment of an interim Palestinian government - the Palestinian Authority (PA).
The accords set the framework for Palestinian elections, and the PA was given a five-year lifespan. But the provisional government still exists today, plagued by allegations of corruption and police brutality.
Despite being granted limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank, Israel has maintained military control over the entire area.
Experts have said the accords were designed to ensure Israel's economic and security dominance over the Palestinians, instead of facilitating a tangible deal.

Why were the accords a failure?
To Palestinian leaders, the accords were doomed to fail.
Major sticking points were left unresolved at the time of the signing of the accords. These included concerns about territory, illegal Jewish settlements, the status of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and the right of return.
Among other things, they also introduced the controversial security coordination between Israel and the PA.
But to Israel, the accords were not a failure, Osamah Khalil, professor of US and Middle East history at Syracuse University, said.
'Israel had no intention of agreeing to the emergence of a viable, contiguous, and independent Palestinian state,' Khalil told Al Jazeera.
'Israel was able to pursue its occupation and settlement policies with the political cover of endless negotiations,' he said.
Alaa Tartir, director of SIPRI's Middle East and North Africa Programme, agreed. He said the accords offered Israel an internationally sponsored framework to 'sustain its occupation and solidify its colonial control over Palestine and the Palestinian people' over the past 30 years.
They were inherently 'designed and structured' so as not to bring the Palestinians closer to freedom and self-determination, Tartir told Al Jazeera.
The absence of a final deal has largely dictated the way Israel has exerted its control through the present. Reports by leading human rights organisations have argued that Israel has maintained a   over Palestinians.
All the while, the PA has done little to stop successive Israeli governments from expanding illegal Jewish settlements, restricting Palestinians' freedom of movement, taking Palestinian resources and arresting Palestinians on a near-daily basis.
Before the accords were signed, Israel mainly dealt with the daily life of Palestinians 'from a security perspective', Ersheid said.
'They ensured people were not engaged in activities relating to the resistance and pushed them to accept the idea of making peace with the occupation,' he said.
According to him, Israel often facilitated work opportunities for Palestinians by issuing permits or by easing other factors involved to 'distract' them.
'If people worked, it was at the expense of their participation in national movements and in the resistance,' he said.
But the realities of Israeli occupation and its 'brutality' were still very much apparent, prior to the first Intifada, Ersheid added. Random checkpoints were set up, while arrests, home demolitions, and the expropriation of lands were very common.
The occupation became even harsher after the first Intifada. 'They continued to occupy us but this time, with an iron fist,' Ersheid said.
Rabin, who was Israel's defence minister at the time, ordered Israeli army commanders to break the bones of Palestinian protesters. This happened to anyone 'resisting in the streets', Ersheid recalled.
Undermining Palestinian unity
The six-year Intifada was characterised by popular mobilisation, mass protests, civil disobedience, as well as boycott movements that aimed to fuel the national economy.
It was not enough to bring about economic autonomy. Palestinians in the West Bank were banned from working in Israel, and the PLO's funds had started to rapidly deplete after being pushed out of Lebanon following the country's civil war.
In fact, the PLO had reportedly signalled to the United States and Israel that it was willing to enter into a mutual recognition agreement as early as 1981.
By 1993, the regional and international landscapes were 'highly unfavourable to the PLO', Khalil said.
According to Khalil, the accords have also been devastating to Palestinian unity.
Geographically, Palestinians were divided between the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. There are also Palestinian refugees in exile, in the diaspora, and Palestinian citizens of Israel.
This fragmentation was 'exacerbated by political rifts' over the accords, Khalil said.
Tartir also noted that the accords made Palestinians 'weaker, more fragmented, and further away from statehood'.
The accords also ensured that all aspects of the Palestinian economy, including trade and agriculture, would always be dependent on Israel.
Despite this, the PA has done little over the years to improve the economic situation for Palestinians, many of whom have resorted to working in Israel as low-skilled workers.
The PA has relied heavily on international donors and foreign aid for survival and has long used the bulk of funds to pay the salaries of civil servants instead of investing in the local infrastructure.
There has remained a of lack adequate leadership that can act as a viable alternative to the PA, mainly due to PA policies – in coordination with Israel – adopted to crush dissent.
The last presidential elections took place in 2005, during which a   emerged between Fatah - the party that heads the PA, and Hamas – the group that has governed Gaza since 2007. Multiple efforts to reach a deal to end their divide have been unsuccessful.
According to Khalil, the PA was only intended to 'administer the accords'. It was never meant to be the representative of the Palestinian people. But the PA has now entrenched itself along with its limited power.
'The leadership of the Palestinian Authority, as well as the United States and Israel, do not want new elections," Khalil said. "Unless they can ensure that their hand-picked candidates will win.'

Uncertainty, hope for Palestinian, Israeli families before Gaza truce

Both Palestinians and Israelis have shared their mixed reactions to the announcement of a brief  , which will see Israeli captives held by Hamas being exchanged in stages with Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
While there is a sense of excitement and anticipation at the possible release and return of a loved one, there is also a feeling of sadness and disappointment about   and the widespread suffering.
Maha Arafat, from Nablus in the occupied West Bank, has been awaiting the release of her daughter Maryam from an Israeli jail.
"We didn't expect the swap to be this way. So many victims in Gaza. Images that no one can comprehend," she told Al Jazeera. "Sometimes I'll say, I don't want my daughter released. Just let Gaza be. We are so affected by what's happening there."
Mediator Qatar announced on Thursday that Israel and Hamas agreed to a   in fighting, which includes the exchange of some of the captives taken by Palestinian group Hamas during an attack in southern Israel on October 7, for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.
The truce is set to begin on Friday at 7am (05:00 GMT). The first batch of hostages being held in Gaza - 13 women and children - will be released at approximately 4pm (14:00 GMT) and handed over to the Red Cross. Palestinian prisoners are also meant to be released on Friday.
Under the agreement, Hamas will free a total of 50 captives, while Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners.
About 5,200 Palestinians were in Israeli prisons before October 7, and 3,000 have since been arrested, including 145 children and 95 women.
Who among the long list of Palestinian prisoners will be allowed to leave and when is in the hands of the Israeli authorities.
(Al Jazeera)
Nisreen al-Titi, also from Nablus, and the sister of a Palestinian prisoner, told Al Jazeera that she has mixed emotions about her possible release.
It remains unclear if her sister Aseel – who has been in prison for more than a year after being accused by Israel of trying to stab an Israeli guard while visiting her incarcerated brother – will be freed.
But her family remains hopeful.
"Our uncle was killed, and our brother was shot while Aseel was in prison. She doesn't know. When she's released, she'll see that life has changed," said al-Titi. "Yes we are happy, but it's definitely incomplete."
Israel's hardline Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir has instructed the head of the country's prison service, Katy Perry, to quash attempts to celebrate prisoner releases within incarceration facilities, reported the Times of Israel.
He reportedly also told Israeli police commissioner Kobi Shabtai to use "an iron fist" against attempts to celebrate prisoner releases or support terrorism.
Al Jazeera senior political analyst Marwan Bishara said: "They won't let the Palestinians mourn or celebrate. If mourning or celebrating isn't allowed, what is allowed?If you cannot resist peacefully, how else can people bring about freedom for their loved ones?"
Reporting from Nablus, Al Jazeera's Zein Basravi said that the families of Palestinian prisoners were tense amid news that no West Bank prisoners would be released as part of the deal.
"This is an intrinsic issue for every Palestinian. They have either spent time in an Israeli prison or know someone who has. For Palestinians, this has been a very tense time. We have been speaking to families of people who have been named on the list, but they say they still have not been told anything and have no confirmation," he said.
"Not knowing is something that has been completely consuming them. There was excitement when we met with them earlier yesterday [Thursday]," he said, but noted that many remain sceptical and believe their family members or others could always be rearrested, as has been the case in the past.
More than 14,500 people have been killed in Israel's attacks on Gaza since October 7, including nearly 6,000 children. In Israel, the official death toll from Hamas's assault stands at about 1,200.
"I didn't win the lottery," said Guy Metzger, after hearing that his mother was not among the first group of Israelis set to be released.
His parents Tamar Metzger, 78, and Yoram Metzger, 80, were taken captive.Metzger told The Wall Street Journal newspaper that he hoped his mother, Tamar, could still be among the women and children set to be released in the coming days. The deal does not include any adult men.
Gideon Levy, a columnist with Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said the release of some hostages will spark both celebration and mourning in Israel, with many others still being held.
'Right now Israelis are supporting the continuation of the war, but there will be a moment in which Israel will have to ask herself - until when and what will come after and at what price are we going to continue? All those are open questions now and the coming days will show if we are going for another escalation after the truce," he said.
Basravi reported that "people say they are grateful about the ceasefire but they feel it will be an incomplete happiness if their loved ones are not released", adding that many fear a truce in Gaza would mean an uptick in the already  .

For displaced Palestinians in Syria, Israel war evokes Nakba and solidarity

Idlib, Syria – In a small house in northwestern Syria, Muhammad Haninun is glued to his mobile phone, following the latest Israeli attacks taking place in Gaza.
For more than a month, he has watched videos of the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip and the displacement of civilians trying to escape the bombing. All the while, the events bring back clear memories of what he endured 75 years ago.
The 80-year-old cannot help but think about the similarities between what he is seeing in Gaza and what he experienced when he and his family were displaced during the  , or "catastrophe", in 1948 when Israel was created and more than 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly uprooted from their land and thousands were killed.
"The Palestinian tragedy is happening again," Haninun said. "The people in Gaza are facing war without receiving any help the same as we did before."

'A cracked record'
Since October 7, when the armed wing of the Palestinian group  , breached the   that surrounds Gaza and attacked southern Israel, Western countries, led by the United States, hastened to condemn the movement that has been running the besieged Gaza Strip since 2006.
The condemnation was followed by Western financial and military support for Israel, which has been relentlessly bombing Gaza, one of the most  , for  . Since October 7, at least 10,812 Palestinians, including 4,412 children, have been   on Gaza. More than 1,400 people have been killed in Israel.
Similarly, during the first half of the 20th century,  provided   in the form of protection and weapons to Zionists, encouraged Jewish immigration from Europe to Palestine and allowed them to displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes as they built a new state for themselves.
In November 1948, Israelis used aircraft to bomb the northern village of Tarshiha in the countryside of Acre, destroying three houses – including Haninun's family home – and killing seven of his relatives.
"Before that, we had evacuated our homes several times for two or three days and returned. We did not take anything," he recalled. "We thought we would return, especially since we were not able to recover the dead from under the rubble."
But they never could.
Haninun, then five years old, and four members of his family were forced to move between seven cities in Lebanon and Syria before they were allowed to stay in a refugee camp in Aleppo, a 'tragic' setting with a small room for each family, no kitchen, bathroom or running water and shared toilets.
He remembers Arab radio stations and governments promising Palestinians a quick return – after seven days, then after seven weeks, then after seven months, until more than seven decades had passed.
'This cracked record has been playing since 1948, when people were fleeing from one village to another, only to face massacres afterwards, because the enemy viewed 'others' as animals, and killing them just like killing cattle – and this logic is still the same today.'
Haninun moved to the Syrian capital, Damascus, to study history. After this, he worked as a teacher in Aleppo, living in the camp there, until the Syrian war forced him to flee to Idlib in 2014. But what he still longs for is the chance, one day, to return to Palestine – and to his roots.
'There is still hope,' Haninun said. 'If I die before I return to Palestine, I will tell my children and grandchildren that you have a right to that land and we are its true owners.'

Strengthening the Palestinian cause
On Thursday, the Ain Jalut Scouts and the Syrian Private Scouts marched through downtown Idlib, just one of the many activities held in the area over the past few weeks in support of Gaza.
Ayman Muhammad, 40, a displaced Palestinian residing in the northwestern Syrian city and the scout leader of the Ain Jalut group, told Al Jazeera that the injustice that Palestinians have endured for 75 years is the motivation for staging protests as well as fundraising and providing support via social media.
Israel's war on Gaza has strengthened the Palestinian cause, Muhammad believes. 'Today, the West and the East, from one end to the other, stand with the Palestinian people against the aggression.'
During October,   around the world witnessed demonstrations with hundreds of thousands of people participating to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and freedom for Palestine.
Palestinians in Idlib cannot stand by and watch, Muhammad said. Despite the difficult economic and security conditions in Idlib, he added, members of the Palestinian community and Syrian supporters here have managed to collect about $400,000 in donations for Gaza.
Syrian activists also participated in demonstrations in support of Palestine despite bombing by government forces and Russian warplanes  in the country's last rebel stronghold.
For Palestinians in northern Syria who are living through  , the Syrian revolution and the Palestinian cause are now inseparable, Muhammad believes. "Victory will come for both causes because the right will not be lost as long as we demand it," he said.

Why Latin America's 'pink tide' is taking a stand against Israel

November 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Bogota, Colombia - As Israel's bombardment of Gaza enters its second month, world leaders have increasingly voiced concern over the rising death toll and suspected human rights violations in the Palestinian territory.
But in the West, few have been as vocal — or as   — as the leftist leaders in  , many of whom came to power as part of a progressive wave known as the '  '.
On October 31, Bolivia severed  its   with Israel, citing 'the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in the Gaza Strip'. Colombia and Chile echoed that criticism, recalling their diplomats from Israel the very same day.
'If Israel does not stop the massacre of the Palestinian people, we cannot be there,' Colombian President Gustavo Petro posted  on the social media platform X.
His message came minutes after his Chilean counterpart, Gabriel Boric, denounced  the Israeli offensive as a 'collective punishment on the Palestinian population in Gaza'.
Analysts said these acts of censure send a powerful signal from Latin America, a region that has largely maintained close, if sometimes tense, ties with Israel.
'It speaks to a Latin America that is not willing to tolerate such obvious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law,' said Mauricio Jaramillo, an international relations expert.

The Latin American leaders' sharp rhetoric, he added, stood in stark contrast with statements from other Western leaders, like United States  , who have been more circumspect in their criticism of Israel.
In response to Latin America's diplomatic backlash, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on Colombia and Chile to support its right 'to protect its citizens'. To do otherwise, Israel suggested , would be to align 'with Venezuela and Iran in support of Hamas terrorism'.
It also called  Bolivia's decision to cut relations altogether 'a surrender to terrorism'.
Bolivia, Chile and Colombia were not alone in their criticism. By Friday, the leftist government in Honduras had likewise pulled its ambassador  from Israel for 'consultations'. And after last week's bombing of  , Gaza's largest refugee camp, more left-leaning leaders from Latin America spoke out against the Israeli violence.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Argentina, for instance, home to the largest Jewish community in Latin America, condemned the attack in a statement : 'Nothing justifies the violation of international humanitarian law.'

Cold War legacy on left-wing politics
The current conflict in Gaza, however, is not the first time Latin America's leftist leaders have taken a stand against Israel.
Jaramillo pointed out that Cuba's   became the first Latin American leader to break relations with Israel back in 1973.
Announced in the midst of the Cold War, Castro's decision served as a rebuke both to Israeli aggression in the Middle East and to its biggest ally, the US — Cuba's adversary at the time.
The legacy of the Cold War has primed Latin America's leftist leaders to be sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, according to Jehad Jusef, the vice president of the Palestinian Union of Latin America, an association of Palestinian diaspora groups.
During the Cold War, the US backed military dictatorships in Latin America that suppressed leftist movements, Jusef said.
That history, he argued, serves as a parallel for the modern-day situation in Gaza, where the US is supporting Israel in a campaign that has raised grave  .
Israel played its own role in Latin America's Cold War period, serving as a major arms dealer to the US-backed military dictatorships in places like   and  .
'Imperialism in Latin America is the same as imperialism in the Middle East,' Jusef said.

Experiences with displacement
Experts said Israel's settlement of Palestinian territories has also fostered a sense of recognition among Latin American leaders.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians faced   during the 1948 establishment of the state of Israel after a period of prolonged Western involvement in the region. The UN continues to denounce the   in Palestinian territories like the West Bank as illegal.
That history resonates in Latin America, where an estimated 42 million people identify as Indigenous. They too continue to grapple with a legacy of dispossession from their ancestral lands and racial discrimination, as part of European colonisation.
'Progressive movements in Latin America approach the Palestinian cause as one of decolonization,' said Manuel Rayran, an expert in international relations. 'They identify with that cause because [many of the inequalities] seen in Latin America today are inherited from colonialism.'
Some political analysts like Cecilia Baeza have noted that Indigenous groups have even taken a leadership role in supporting Palestinian causes.
'In Chile and Bolivia, where this political convergence is particularly strong, it is not unusual to see Palestine solidarity protests called by both Palestinian diaspora organizations and Indigenous movements,' Baeza wrote in a 2015 article.

Political divides shape Israel relations
Support for the Palestinian cause also falls along stark ideological lines in Latin America.
In the case of Bolivia, the country's first Indigenous president — the socialist   — was also the first to sever relations with Israel in 2009.
But his successor, the right-wing  , decided to renew ties within weeks of taking office.
The country's current president,  , is considered part of the present-day 'pink tide'.
This leftward trend began with the election of President   in Mexico in 2018 and continued with leftist victories in  ,  ,  ,   and  .
In Colombia, the 2022   was particularly historic: Never before had a left-wing president taken office.
But   in Colombia has shown some of the weakness of the latest 'pink tide' movement.

Breaking ties comes at a cost
Only a year into his term, Petro's approval ratings   to 32 percent, as he struggles to implement his domestic platform against a strong right-wing backlash.
While opposition leaders in Colombia have accused Petro of using the crisis in the Middle East to divert attention away from his domestic troubles, Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior analyst for the think tank Crisis Group, questioned that logic.
She argued that — instead of winning public opinion points at home — Petro's decision to take a stand against Israel could come at a cost.
After Petro compared remarks  made by the Israeli defence minister to those made by Nazis, Israel suspended its military exports to Colombia, including the sale of planes and machine guns used in the government's efforts against rebel forces.
Actions and comments from other Latin American leaders could lead to similar repercussions, Dickinson warned. Israel's defence exports alone are a $12.5bn industry.
'This is not an easy or obvious decision,' she said. 'It's clearly a political choice that these leaders have made despite the possible risks to their own interests.'
The diplomatic rebuke from countries like Colombia, Chile and Bolivia is unlikely to deter Israel from escalating the war, she added.
'These are countries that don't have a definitive economic or political relationship [with Israel] that could shift the conflict in one way or another,' Dickinson said.
It does, however, build pressure on the US, Israel's closest ally, to call for a ceasefire.
Dickinson said she suspected that the South American countries timed their actions to coincide with an international summit in Washington last Friday. Both Petro and Boric used the meeting to encourage their US counterpart to condemn Israeli actions.
'It's a point of entry for Latin American leaders to push this forward with the United States,' Dickinson said.

November 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel and Hamas have agreed to a   in fighting that includes an exchange of some of the captives taken during the October 7 Hamas attack for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.
Here's what we know about the captives and prisoners:
How many captives and prisoners are being released?
More than 200 captives were taken by Hamas during its  . Of these, about 50 will be released under the   agreed to on Wednesday. Reuters reported that a senior US official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, saying that there is anticipation that the actual number of captives released will be higher than 50.
In the days before the deal, Hamas had released four captives. Israel rescued one soldier who had been abducted and said it had found the bodies of two other captives.
The truce calls for 150 Palestinian prisoners to be released from Israeli jails. About 5,200 Palestinians were in Israeli prisons before October 7. After the outbreak of violence on October 7, another 3,000 were arrested, including 145 children and 95 women.
What do we know about the captives being released?
The 50 captives being released over the four days will be  , according to a statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.
At least half of all the captives kept by Hamas hold foreign and dual citizenship from approximately 40 countries including the United States, Thailand, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, Germany, Chile, Spain and Portugal, according to the Israeli government.
The senior US official said that of the captives to be released, three are US citizens.
These include two women and a three-year-old girl whose parents were killed in the initial Hamas attack. The official did not provide information about captives of other nationalities who are expected to be released.
French Foreign Affairs Minister Catherine Colonna said on Wednesday that France hopes its eight citizens believed to be captives are part of the group that is released.
According to Hamas, the captives are being held in 'safe places and tunnels' in Gaza.
Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, who was freed by Hamas earlier, reported that the captives slept on mattresses on the floor of tunnels and were provided with medical care.
The Israeli military claimed that it has evidence of some captives being held at or under hospitals. The military also said on Sunday that Noa Marciano, a soldier whose body was recovered, was killed by Hamas at al-Shifa Hospital. Hamas said she died in an Israeli air strike.
On October 20, Hamas released captives Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, 17. They released Israeli women Nurit Cooper, 79, and Lifshitz on October 23.
The armed wing of the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad announced the death of an Israeli captive late on Tuesday. Families of captives have put pressure on the Israeli government to free the captives.
What do we know about the prisoners in Israel being released?
Hamas has said that Israel has agreed to release 150 prisoners, while the Israeli Ministry of Justice presented a list  of 300 Palestinian prisoners who could potentially be released.
Thirty-three adult women are on the list and the majority of the remaining names on the list are teenage boys.
The prisoners on the Israeli list were arrested between 2021 and 2023, with most of them accused of threatening security, illegally entering Israel without a permit, and violent crimes.
Thousands of Palestinians in Israeli prisons are facing administrative detention, which means they are held indefinitely behind bars without facing trial or charges.
Save the Children   that the children in Israeli detention are subjected to abuse. The nature of the abuse ranges from sexual violence to physical and psychological abuse. The report added that some are deprived of food, water and sleep.
'The main alleged crime for these detentions is stone-throwing, which can carry a 20-year sentence in prison for Palestinian children,' said the report.

Israeli forces have killed five Palestinians in the West Bank, according to health officials, as violence   in the occupied territory amid Israel's war against Hamas in  .
The Israeli army said on Monday that its forces encountered explosive devices in a raid on the northern city of Jenin and labelled another incursion, near Hebron, a "counterterrorism operation".
The Palestinian health ministry said four people aged 23 to 28 were killed during the early morning raid on the Jenin refugee camp, a stronghold of Palestinian armed groups and the target of frequent military incursions.
Another nine people were wounded, a ministry statement said.
According to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, "more than 100 military vehicles and two bulldozers" took part in the raid.
Military drones hovered over the area and army snipers were positioned on buildings around Jenin's main hospital.
Part of the hospital's perimeter wall was demolished by armoured military bulldozers.
The Israeli military said its troops uncovered "explosive devices that were planted under the roads in order to attack [its] forces".
The Palestinian health ministry also said a 23-year-old man was shot dead by Israeli forces in Yatta city near Hebron.
The Israeli military said its forces had "conducted counterterrorism in the area to apprehend wanted suspects".
The ministry also confirmed on Monday that another 23-year-old man died after being shot by a settler days ago in Ras Karkar, northwest of Ramallah.
Previous killings
The deaths came a day after five Palestinians were killed by army fire during military incursions into the occupied West Bank.
The health ministry says about 120 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied territory since Hamas fighters stormed across the Gaza border for the attack on October 7.
Hamas fighters killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has hit back with a relentless bombardment that has killed more than 8,300 people, more than half of them children, according to Gaza's health ministry. In recent days, Israeli ground forces have entered Gaza.
The West Bank was already a hotbed of tension before the Gaza war, with frequent Israeli army raids, a surge in attacks by Jewish settlers and Palestinian attacks on settlements.
Israel occupied the West Bank during the 1967 Palestinian-Israeli war and its forces regularly carry out raids on Palestinian fighters there.

Also, a spokesperson for the Israeli military said his country has gathered 100,000 reserve troops near Gaza.
A Wall Street Journal report said Iran helped Hamas plan its surprise attacks against Israel over the weekend, but Iran's mission to the United Nations said Tehran was not involved in the attacks.

Thousands rally in Malaysia's capital in support of Palestinians

October 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia - Thousands of people have rallied in the Malaysian capital to express solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel's ongoing bombardment of Gaza.
Protesters gathered in Kuala Lumpur's Independence Square on Sunday for the rally organised by local NGOs Viva Palestina Malaysia (VPM) and MyCare, which have organised humanitarian assistance for Palestinians.
Many protesters wore the keffiyeh, a traditional Palestinian scarf, and carried placards calling for peace in Palestine and an end to the United States' support of the Israeli military.
'It's hard to even watch the videos because … I can't imagine [what] it is like to live there with bombs all around,' Syikin Samsuddin, a 40-year-old IT specialist, told Al Jazeera at the rally.
'It's very unfortunate … that during this era, this peaceful era for most of the world, there's one place where it's occupied and there's apartheid. It's so sad,' she said.
Hussein Abuzaineh, a 35-year-old Palestinian protester, said his family in the West Bank were on 'high alert' after an escalation in violence in the territory, including an   that military officials said was used as a command centre by Palestinian fighters.
'From here, it makes me feel helpless or powerless to some extent to see that the boundaries of the atrocities can still keep happening at more aggressive or extreme stages," Abuzaineh told Al Jazeera.
'But we do what we can to show our support and send our love and care to everyone, especially the civilians out there. Because in the end, everyone wants to live peacefully, in harmony with everyone around."

Sunday's peaceful rally followed a more confrontational protest on Friday outside the US embassy in Kuala Lumpur, during which protesters scuffled with police. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has vocally supported the Palestinian cause and condemned Israel's bombardment of Gaza, which Palestinian officials say has killed about 4,400 people."I don't have any choice as there is killing of young children and women," Anwar told reporters on Saturday as he wrapped up a trip to Saudi Arabia.Last week, Anwar announced that Malaysia would donate 100 million ringgit ($21m) in humanitarian aid to Gaza.
Malaysia, where about 60 percent of the population is Muslim, does not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel and advocates for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Kuala Lumpur has a longstanding relationship with Hamas, the Palestinian group that administers Gaza, which the US and other Western countries have designated a "terrorist" organisation.

Standing outside Kuala Lumpur's Independence Square, IT specialist Samsuddin lamented that Palestinians are seen as 'oppressors rather than the victims' by the West.
'I think we should support the Palestinians who have been oppressed for many, many long years, for almost 50 years,' she said. 'We as humans collectively, as sisters and brothers, we should support each other.'
Abuzaineh said he was happy to see that attitudes towards Palestinians were improving around the world, albeit slowly.
'[The international response is] somewhat polarised right now,' he said.
'And it shows that there's a lot of awareness that's increasing towards the support of the Palestinian cause, and to finally give a fair share of attention to what the Palestinians have been pleading for since 1948, which is fair standards of living and equality.'

November 5th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC – Tens of thousands of people have gathered in the United States capital to demand a ceasefire in Gaza as the US continues to resist calls for a halt to fighting despite the  .
The demonstrators in Washington, DC on Saturday directed their anger towards US President Joe Biden, accusing him of enabling genocide against Palestinians.
"Biden, Biden, you can't hide; we charge you with genocide," the protesters chanted.
United Nations experts have warned  of a growing risk of genocide in Gaza amid Israel's relentless bombardment of the enclave, which was launched in response to Hamas's October 7 attacks on southern Israeli communities.
The UN's Genocide Convention defines genocide as 'acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group', including killings and measures to prevent births.
The Biden administration has urged Israel to "minimise"  , but also insisted that it is not drawing any "  " for how the US ally conducts its military operations.

Biden has also requested   in aid for Israel from Congress to help fund the current war in Gaza, which has killed at least 9,488 Palestinians, according to health authorities in the Hamas-governed enclave.
Many protesters at Saturday's rally called for an end to US assistance to Israel. The demonstration stretched several blocks from Freedom Plaza, near the White House, eastward towards the US Capitol.
Al Jazeera spoke to many of the protesters. Here's what they had to say:
Nidaa, demonstrator from Gaza
Nidaa, who chose to be identified by her first name only, said her family in Gaza is experiencing constant bombardment with no safe place in the entire territory.
"Stop the war. Stop  . Stop this genocide in Gaza – that's the number one message we are sending today, and I hope our government will listen to us. I hope our people in Gaza, in Palestine in general, know that we are here. Hopefully, they will hear our voices to at least to cheer them up a little bit – that they are not alone."

Huda Alkuraey, Yemen-American advocate
Alkuraey, who travelled to Washington, DC from South Florida to join the protest, voiced anger at the US and international reaction to the conflict.
"Palestinians haven't had freedom for over 70 years. And it's time that we make our voice heard, and we start telling the world that this is not right."
David Horowitz, Jewish-American activist
Horowitz stressed the need for a ceasefire, calling the carnage in Gaza an "abomination". He also slammed the Biden administration's call for   as insufficient.
"We should be calling for a ceasefire, and instead they're talking about a 'pause', which isn't really a stoppage of anything. They're going to let the supply trucks through, and then they're going to continue to fight. It's a euphemism and the public doesn't understand that. It really is not a ceasefire."
Pro-Palestinian activists have warned that the population of Gaza is at risk of genocide [Ali Harb/Al Jazeera]
Ayan Yusuf, Somali-American protester
Yusuf came to Washington, DC from Boston to attend the rally. She said the Biden administration is not seeing Palestinians' humanity.
"We are here to speak for the innocent people. We are here to let the world know that what Israel and the United States are doing is not self-defence; it's a genocide. And we're not supporting that regardless of religion, regardless of our ways, regardless of agenda. We are all human beings."
Eisha Raja, Pakistani-American activist
Raja dismissed a newly announced push  by the Biden administration to battle Islamophobia in the US as a "despicable" effort to distract from Washington's policies in Gaza.
"We want to 100 percent  . We need this to end. We don't want to send any of our tax dollars to Israel anymore. We don't want to be supporting genocide – blood on our hands."
Some pro-Palestinian voters in the US say they will no longer vote for US President Joe Biden due to his support for Israel [Ali Harb/Al Jazeera]
Maria Habib, Lebanese-American demonstrator
Habib, who was dressed in a traditional Palestinian dress known as thobe, said she is having a difficult time coping with the war and the graphic images of the atrocities in Gaza. She added that she will not vote for Biden and other Democratic candidates next year.
"They have no more votes – from me or my family or anybody. It's done. I did vote for them in the past because basically, we don't have a better choice. Now, it's not even a choice."
Pro-Palestinian protesters say the Biden administration is not recognising Palestinians' humanity [Ali Harb/Al Jazeera]
Siham Alfred, Nakba survivor
Siham Alfred, who was forced out of her home as a child during the establishment of Israel in 1948, expressed fear over the potential of displacement of Palestinians out of Gaza, denouncing Biden and other Western leaders.
"Shame, they are racist. They do not believe that Palestinians are equal to Israelis. I will never  . He's a coward and a criminal."

Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered in central London and begun marching in solidarity with Palestine chanting "Stop bombing Gaza" and "Ceasefire now".
The "National March for Palestine" on Saturday is the latest   in the British capital to show support for the Palestinians since Israel launched an air and ground offensive on the Gaza Strip following Palestinian group Hamas's attacks on southern Israel on October 7.
The Hamas assault killed  , and saw more than 240 taken captive.
Israel's attacks, which it has said are aimed at wiping out the Palestinian group that rules Gaza, have killed more than 11,000 people in 34 days, including more than 4,500 children.
Former British opposition leader   and member of Parliament for Islington also took part in the pro-Palestine rally and demanded a ceasefire.

The UK government's ministers had called for Saturday's march to be cancelled because it falls on  , which marks the end of World War I and commemorates those killed in military action.
On Wednesday, British Prime Rishi Sunak told reporters that he would hold the Metropolitan police commissioner accountable for safety since the police official defied demands to ban the pro-Palestine protests on Armistice Day.
A few hours before the protest began on Saturday morning, a mile (1.6km) away from the start of the march, about 1,000 people lined the streets to watch the remembrance events at the Cenotaph war memorial.
Among the crowd, some right-wing counter-protesters  opposed to the pro-Palestinian march chanted messages including, "We want our country back".
The Metropolitan police said even their officers "faced aggression from counter-protesters" who were in the Whitehall area while the two minutes silence for Armistice Day was being marked.
"The scenes of disorder we witnessed by the far-right at the Cenotaph are a direct result of the Home Secretary's words. The police's job has been made much harder," the mayor of London Sadiq Khan said in a post on X.
Home Secretary   recently called pro-Palestinian demonstrations 'hate marches' and said the police 'play favourites' and take a soft stance towards rallies in support of Gaza.
"The Met have my full support to take action against anyone found spreading hate and breaking the law," Khan's post added.
The scenes of disorder we witnessed by the far-right at the Cenotaph are a direct result of the Home Secretary's words. The police's job has been made much harder.

Maghazi, Gaza – Ahmed Nehad, 24, left Gaza two months ago to pursue a master's degree in the United Kingdom and has been talking about Palestine since he got there, especially in the past two weeks.
Adham Mousa, 27, has been away from Gaza for 11 years, ending up in the United States, where he lives and works. He has been back to Gaza only once, in November 2022, and now does not know when he will be able to return.
They are two of the manyPalestinians outside   who are mourning at a distance after hearing of relatives and friends being killed under intense Israeli   as hundreds of people die, entire neighbourhoods are obliterated and the healthcare system collapses.
The struggle of Palestinians far from their extended support networks is compounded because no matter how much their friends try to support them, this kind of pain is hard to explain or share fully.
'I'd rather be home with my family'
Mousa's father used to send him a "Good morning" text every day ever since he left Gaza.
Now he sends a text saying: "We are fine and alive" whenever he gets access to mobile service or the internet.
Mousa says words cannot describe his feelings about what is happening to Gaza – anger, sadness, frustration and fear grip him as he worries about his family and the  .

"I know what it is like to be under constant air strikes and having to flee your house in fear of getting bombed. I was there in 2008-2009 during the Gaza  , but I'd much rather be home with my family than watch them suffer from afar on a daily basis," he said.
Nehad spends his days monitoring the assaults on Palestinians in the  , Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and within Israel, something that he says "feels like a job".
"Every day, news about killings, displacements, home demolitions and arrests of innocent Palestinians in the middle of the night fills my work and conversations about Palestine to everyone here," Nehad said.
When the attacks this month in Israel by the armed wing of Hamas, the group that  , first made the news, Nehad says, the whole world was in shock around him with colleagues, classmates and professors discussing the "conflict". Probably because, he said, the victims were Israeli, not Palestinians.
His university and other institutions in the UK sent out emails condemning the "terrorist" events in Israel.
"My family and all my friends were displaced from their homes. Our home was destroyed. Gaza, which I left two months ago, is in ruins. But the emails haven't changed. We still get emails condemning Hamas and warning us against showing any sympathy to Palestinian 'terrorists'," Nehad added.
He does not feel safe in the UK, he said. Anyone seen to be "sympathising" with Palestine, including by raising the Palestinian flag or wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh headdress, is reported to university management or the authorities. Attending   is risky.
'I want to be where I belong'
Mousa feels less alone, having been supported by friends and co-workers as if he has been through a bereavement.
"The first thing I did was to look for flight tickets to return to Gaza and be with my family. But the Egyptian government closed the   as soon as the Israelis started bombing Gaza, so there was no legal way for me to return to the homeland," Mousa said.
So he stayed in the US and tried instead to educate people on what was happening in Gaza and other Palestinian areas.
"I don't think most people here are curious enough to learn about the Palestinian struggle on their own," he said, adding that he now uses his social media profiles to share the story of Palestine.
"It is a frustrating position to be in, but I will never stop sharing the truth, and I hope others will start sharing it too," Mousa said.
Contacting families in Gaza is nearly impossible. Mousa tries to call every hour of the day because there is no way to tell when his loved ones will have   or mobile service.
"It's a relief when someone picks up the phone. I immediately think, 'Thank God. They're alive,'" Mousa said.
His father was meant to come to visit him, but the trip is now cancelled. "I don't get to see my family, and only God knows when and if I will be able to see them again," he said.
Nehad is similarly in pain. "I'm consumed by guilt. I feel a profound betrayal. I want to be under the bombardment.
"This world, which goes on as if the extermination of two million people in Gaza isn't happening right now, doesn't fit me.
"I'm the 'other' in it. I want to leave it. I want to be where I belong, in Gaza, the unimportant place, with the 'others' whose blood, homes and lives don't matter."

Hamas rejects Israeli claim over installations under al-Shifa hospital

Palestinian armed group Hamas has rejected Israeli claims that it is using hospitals for military purposes, as Israel   of the besieged Gaza Strip.
Hamas political official Ezzat El-Reshiq on Friday denied allegations that the group was using the   as a shield for its underground military infrastructure, and said the claims have "no basis in truth'.
Israeli spokesman Daniel Hagari said earlier that Hamas had 'turned hospitals into command and control centres and hideouts for Hamas terrorists and commanders'. Hagari also accused Hamas of storing fuel for military operations inside hospitals in Gaza.
The al-Shifa Medical Complex is the largest medical health institution within the Gaza Strip. Located in Gaza City, it includes three specialised hospitals; the Surgery Hospital, the Internal Medicine Hospital, and the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital.
Thousands of Palestinian civilians have sought refuge at the hospital since Israel launched a devastating assault on Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel.
El-Reshiq warned that the claim was an attempt to 'pave the way for targeting a hospital that contains thousands of wounded and shelters more than 40,000 displaced people'.
The rejection came as Israel escalated its bombardment of Gaza, expanding air raids and artillery fire in a fierce barrage that knocked out phone and internet services across the Palestinian territory.
Hagari said Israeli ground forces were "expanding operations" in Gaza.
Earlier on Friday, chief of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) Philippe Lazzarini said that aid meant for Palestinians in Gaza was not being diverted for use by Hamas.
"We have solid monitoring mechanisms … UNRWA does not and will not divert any humanitarian aid into the wrong hands," he said.
Hospitals in Gaza have proven an especially tense flashpoint amid Israel's continuing fighting with Hamas, which launched   on southern Israel on October 7 that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
Israel has responded by placing Gaza under total siege, cutting off access to electricity, water, food, and fuel, and conducting a military assault that has pushed hospitals and medical workers  .
More than 100 health workers have been killed, and 15 hospitals out of 35 are out of service, alongside 57 basic healthcare services that have also stopped functioning. Palestinian authorities have said that 7,326 people have been killed and more than 18,967 injured since the fighting began.
Israel and Palestinian authorities have also traded accusations   at the al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, with Palestinian authorities accusing Israel of hitting the hospital with an air raid and Israel stating that the deadly explosion was the result of an errant rocket fired by the group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). The United Nations has called for an independent investigation.

Celtic fined for fans displaying Palestinian flag amid Israel-Gaza war

November 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Scotland's Celtic Football Club has been fined $19,000 after its   during a Champions League match against Atletico Madrid last month, UEFA has said.
The match, which took place at the club's home ground Celtic Park in Glasgow, saw thousands of fans wave the Palestine flag and display banners supporting the people of Gaza amid Israel's war on the besieged strip.
The governing body of football in Europe deemed the flags to be "provocative messages of an offensive nature" in a statement on Wednesday.
Fans, who had been warned by the Scottish club not to display flags before the October 25 game, could be heard singing "You'll Never Walk Alone" while holding the Palestinian flags in a video shared widely on social media.
As kickoff neared, the stadium transformed into asea of Palestinian flags, every stand awash with the colours of Palestine in a show of solidarity with those in Gaza underIsraeli assault.
Supporters also unfurled two large banners at Celtic Park that read "Free Palestine" and "Victory to the Resistance".
The main flag bearers, literally and figuratively, were  - an 'ultras' group formed in 2006, renowned for their Irish Republicanism and unflinching support for the Palestinian cause.
Fearful of penalties, the club urged fans not to heed the Green Brigade's call to show support for Palestine at the match, releasing a statement asking 'that banners, flags and symbols relating to the conflict and those countries involved in it are not displayed at Celtic Park at this time'.
A few days prior to the match, in an apparent warning to the group, Celtic banned the Green Brigade from all away games. Following the display against Atletico Madrid, that ban has been extended to all home games.
In a letter to fans, the club outlined several reasons for the ban, including anti-social behaviour, the use of pyrotechnics and crucially 'against Atletico Madrid, another unauthorised display, breaching the restrictions previously communicated'.
The club was also fined $12,550 for fans blocking passageways and using pyrotechnics.
Fans say support for Palestine will continue
For the Green Brigade, there is little doubt that it was the display of solidarity with Palestine which led to a ban on their attendance.
'The other issues are a smokescreen,'  .
'The club are very clever and cynical. They want to sanction us, they want to punish us. They want to send us a message to try to keep us in line and deter us from doing further action.
"But they know very well that on the issue of Palestine, they're not on strong ground as they don't have a lot of support amongst the wider fanbase on that issue. So they're using other issues that they think they will have support on to sanction us.'
The group said they were 'unashamed of and unequivocal of our support for Palestine" and insisted that it will continue.
'And once again the wider Celtic support showed that they too had the courage and conviction to stand and be counted. To side with the right side of history and voice support for the underdog, which in this case is the Palestinians.'

'We can't confuse Hamas with all Palestinians': Spain says amid aid review

 , the group that rules  , should not be confused with all Palestinians, Spain's top diplomat has said as the country expresses opposition to the proposed suspension of European Union aid to the Palestinian territories.
The Spanish Acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said on Tuesday that Palestinian territories would likely need more aid soon after Hamas's Saturday attack on Israel and   of the Gaza Strip.
"This cooperation must continue; we cannot confuse Hamas, which is in the list of EU's terrorist groups, with thePalestinianpopulation, or thePalestinianAuthority or the United Nation's organisations on the ground," Albares said in an interview with Spanish radio Cadena SER.
EU foreign ministers will meet on the sidelines of a meeting in Oman on the situation in Israel and Gaza to discuss the funding issue on Tuesday after European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi said on Monday on social media platform X that 691 million euros ($728m) in aid had been suspended.
TheEuropean Commission contradictedVarhelyi'sstatement, sayingthat paymentswere not suspended andthat itwas merelyreviewingaid toPalestinianterritories.
Officials also stressed that the review applies only to development funding, not to the separate EU humanitarian aid budget for Palestinians.
Even though countries such as Austria and Germany have announced the end of funding to Palestinian territories, others such as Spain, France and Luxembourg consider the aid flow crucial for the civilian population.
Suspending aid would be "counterproductive", Albares said.
France's foreign ministry also said it was "not in favour of suspending aid which directly benefits the Palestinian populations", adding that it had "made this known to the EU Commission".
Last year, France contributed 95 million euros ($101m) in aid to the Palestinians in Gaza, annexed east Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank run by the Palestinian Authority, and refugee camps in neighbouring countries.
"This aid is focused on supporting the Palestinian populations, in water, health, food security and education," added the ministry.
Distributed through the United Nations, it "directly benefits the Palestinian people" and is "fully in line with the engagements of France", the ministry added.
Luxembourg's Acting Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn also insisted that his government did not support the suspension of aid.
"Two million people live in Gaza. They are also hostages of Hamas. With these methods, we push them into the arms of terrorists," he said.
"We are the largest donor to Gaza. This help is important for young people. This is not money for Hamas. It is for the people of Gaza," he told the AFP news agency.
But the suspension may be supported by other EU states, including the richest, Germany, which announced that it was suspending its own direct aid to the Palestinians.
"It is being examined, that is, temporarily suspended," said a spokeswoman from the German ministry for economic cooperation and development.
The EU announced in February it was contributing 296 million euros for the 2022 budget to help the Palestinian Authority pay civil servant salaries, pensions, healthcare and infrastructure projects.
The bloc says it would provide "up to 1.177 billion euros in financial support from 2021 to 2024".
A European Commission spokeswoman insisted earlier on Monday EU aid "does not fund Hamas or any other terrorist organisation activities, either directly or indirectly".

A Palestinian teenager was shot dead by the Israeli forces during a raid near the city of Jenin in the northern occupied West Bank.
In a statement, the Palestinian health ministry said the 18-year-old was killed by live rounds "to the abdomen" in the town of Kafr Dan. He is the seventh Palestinian to be killed by Israeli forces  .
Israeli troops raided several homes in the town early on Friday, triggering confrontations with Palestinian residents by firing sound bombs, tear gas canisters and live ammunition.
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group identified the victim as Abdullah Abu Hasan and said he was a local fighter from its  .
The Israeli military said soldiers opened fire at suspects who shot and hurled an explosive device at them during a weapons search operation in Kafr Dan. "A hit was identified," it said in a statement.
Violence in the occupied West Bank has surged for more than a year with increased Israeli military raids, inscreased settler assaults on Palestinian villages, and a spate of Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis.
On Tuesday, three Palestinians were killed during a military raid on Jenin, among them a 15-year-old who was   after he discovered them as he was leaving his grandfather's house, according to rights group Defense for Children International – Palestine.
The United Nations has said 2023 is the deadliest year for Palestinians since it started counting fatalities in 2006.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the start of this year, according to the health ministry. At least 35 Israelis have also been killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period.
United States-sponsored statehood negotiations collapsed in 2014 and current diplomatic efforts seem to be focused on forging a historic deal between  .
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, President Mahmoud Abbas said Middle East peace was attainable only when Palestinians achieve "their full rights". He   on the UN to convene a peace conference to "salvage the two-state solution".

Palestinian ambassador urges UN to 'stop the killing' as Israel pounds Gaza

The Palestinian envoy to the United Nations has implored member states to vote to end the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip and to increase aid deliveries to the 2.3 million Palestinians living in the besieged territory.
'I appeal to all of you to vote to stop the killing. Vote for humanitarian aid to reach those whose very survival depends on it. Vote to stop this madness,' Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour said in an emotional speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday.
Arguing for a ceasefire, Mansour said certain nations that he did not name were applying a double standard on the conflict.
"How can representatives of states explain how horrible it is that 1,000 Israelis were killed and not feel the same outrage when 1,000 Palestinians are now killed every single day?" Mansour asked the assembly. "Why not feel a sense of urgency to end their killing?"
The 193-nation General Assembly met for an emergency session as aid agencies and rights groups warned that humanitarian conditions in Gaza are at a critical point more than two weeks into a relentless  .
Israel has bombarded the Palestinian territory since Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,400 people in attacks on southern Israel, according to Israeli officials.
More than 7,000 people have been killed in the Israeli bombardment, according to Gaza authorities, and Israel has also cut off supplies of food, water, electricity and fuel to the territory.
Addressing the General Assembly, Israeli envoy   described the Hamas attack as a "pogrom".
'The rockets were only cover for the pogrom that followed. Barbaric Hamas terrorists invaded Israel from the sea, the land and the air,' Erdan said. 'They came with one purpose: to savagely murder every living thing they encountered.'
 
Erdan made the comments as the assembly began a two-day meeting on the Middle East.
It is due to vote on Friday on a resolution drafted by Arab states that calls for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Speaking on behalf of Arab states, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi accused Israel of "making Gaza a perpetual hell on earth. The trauma will haunt generations to come." He said the impact on Palestinian civilians is immense.
The Israeli siege and assault on Gaza has prompted a   as the death toll continues to rise and aid officials warn of an imminent humanitarian catastrophe.
Medical services in Gaza have been near   for days with fuel supplies strained by Israel's siege of the strip.
On Thursday, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) warned that its fuel stocks were  , and the agency had been forced to suspend 'life-saving services'.
International leaders have also expressed concern that an anticipated Israeli   of Gaza could spark a wider escalation across the region.
In a speech at the UN on Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minster Hossein Amirabdollahian warned that his country did not want to see fighting escalate but "if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire."
In a joint statement on Thursday, the Arab states of Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates condemned what they called Israel's collective punishment and mass displacement of Palestinians.
Human rights groups such as Amnesty International have stressed the need for a  to bring the bloodshed to an end and avoid the chance of fighting spilling over into neighbouring countries.
A delegation of Hamas leaders arrived on Thursday in  , where officials said Iran's deputy foreign minister is also visiting.
Israel condemned Russia, which has ties to all parties involved in the current round of fighting, for hosting members of Hamas, describing the group as 'worse than ISIS'.

Palestinians in occupied West Bank face closures, harassment and attacks

Occupied West Bank – Since the Israeli offensive began on the Gaza Strip on October 7, the violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank has also escalated.
At least 105 Palestinians have been killed, and another 1,550 arrested in a  . Palestinian cities and villages have been cut off from one another through the Israeli closures and the threat of settler attacks, resulting in a near-complete commercial standstill and severe restrictions on movement.
Entrances to most Palestinian villages, towns and cities have been blocked by military checkpoints, earth mounds, cement blocks and iron gates, preventing movement between them.
Al Jazeera spoke to several Palestinians about the impact of these restrictions on their life.
Karim Gibran, B'Tselem director of the field research department in the occupied Palestinian territories
The restrictions imposed by Israel has increased the suffering of Palestinian communities and led to the isolation of families in their homes and lands, especially in areas located in Area C, which is under Israeli civil and security control. (Area C constitutes the bulk of West Bank territory)
Preventing access to water and food needs, especially in the  s, is done by Israel with the aim of displacing the Palestinian communities in those areas.
During the current offensive, the rate of violence practised by settlers against Palestinians has escalated, preventing them from accessing their lands, attacking them while picking olives, expelling them from their fields, and attacking Palestinians moving on roads.
The arming of settlers in the West Bank has increased significantly. This phenomenon has terrified Palestinians, making their movement fraught with danger and fear. The settlers also launched widespread incitement campaigns on social media against the Palestinians, which were fraught with explicit threats to the Palestinians, threatening them with assault, vandalising property, and killing them.
Ahmed Abu Ayyash, 66, owner of a supermarket in Beit Ummar
Everything is closed in the area where I live and work. Beit Ummar is a town located north of the city of Hebron. It is near the al-Arroub camp, south of the city of  . The town has only two entrances that are completely blocked now. Whoever wants to move from Beit Ummar to Hebron has to take long and difficult bypass roads. Instead of the 2km (1.2 miles) we needed to reach Hebron, we now need 30km (18.6 miles).
I own a store called Abu Ayyash Mini Market in an area we call the Beit Ummar Triangle, which connects Beit Ummar to the town of Halhul and the al-Arroub camp. My shop is opposite an Israeli army watchtower.
The store is now completely closed because there is no movement of vehicles on this street. The area which connects Halhul to Beit Ummar to al-Aroub camp is closed by gates and dirt mounds.
I only go to the supermarket about every four days and I can access it because it is close to my house. I just go to check on the goods and electricity. I have a large refrigerator which has goods worth approximately 10,000 thousand shekels ($2,450), all of which are dairy products such as labneh, mortadella, hummus, and canned food. Now, most of their dates have expired.
I also have a parking lot that can accommodate 30 cars. Each car used to pay $10 to park and use it, and now, from October 7 until today, I have not received any cars because the situation is very difficult.

Ahed Musa, 55, food vendor
For the past 10 years, I have been delivering vegetables and fruits by transporting farmers' vegetables from Shufa to Nablus. I also bring vegetables to stores in Tulkarem from the Nablus market.
Today, work is only 1 percent of what it was before October 7 due to the closures. Most stores I delivered to have been closed, as they were dependent on Palestinians from the 194 territories as their primary customers. But now their movement has all but been curtailed. Due to the closure of the checkpoint, the Shufa-Tulkarem   is completely closed by an iron gate and they are not allowed to enter.
The closures have affected my work to a very large extent, as my movement from Tulkarem takes 60km across the Shufa checkpoint to Nablus. Sometimes we take longer and more difficult roads if there are checkpoints, which adds another 20km (12.4 miles) to the journey.

Aisha Abdel Rahman, 59, head teacher of al-Luban Asharqiya Girls Secondary School
My school is one of the most dangerous schools in the West Bank. UNICEF provided us with a bus to transport the female students at the expense of the education ministry.
I have 226 students in the school, ages 10 to 18, grades from seventh to high school. I am responsible for all these lives. As the school director, I am the mother of 226 souls.
The school, which was built in 1946 – two years before the existence of Israel – is located on the main village street. The village is located in the middle of the West Bank, between the cities of Nablus and Ramallah. The school gate, the classrooms, and the yard are all a few meters away from the street, which thousands of settlers pass through every day.
The school and the students have been subjected to harassment and attacks by the settlers, and we had to transfer some of them to the Salfit and Nablus hospitals.
Since October 7, the   and the female students have moved to online learning, which is not without its challenges.
I believe that the current conditions will last a long time and therefore, the school will remain closed perhaps for another weeks or even months. This is the first time this long closure has occurred due to the security situation and the condition of the roads.

Arif al-Hawari, 36, store owner
My brothers and I own a bakery and a supermarket (in Huwara). We live above the bakery which is on the main street. My brothers tried to open the back door to sell bread, cakes, and food to neighbours and people in need. The Israeli army came and opened fire and detained my brother for several hours.
All bakeries, pharmacies, and grocery stores in Huwara have been completely closed for 22 days. A large portion of the people who rented in Huwara have terminated their contracts and moved to work within cities such as Ramallah and Nablus.
Our sales were to all areas of the West Bank, in all its cities, villages and refugee camps.
All the roads are blocked in Huwara, and we lost 60 percent of our customers due to the tense circumstances and conditions.

Jamal Odeh, 56, owner of a wedding and events hall
Since the beginning of the war on Gaza, we have been confined to our homes. Life is unbearable. The Israeli occupation carries out collective punishment on people and allows the settlers to kill us by shooting at our homes.
I, personally, have several shops and businesses on the main Huwara Street, all of which have been closed for three weeks. All aspects of social and economic life have stopped. Today, I am unable to open the door of my house or open a window.
The last wedding celebration was on October 6. People are unable to continue their lives normally. Even before the war on Gaza, we were subjected to daily harassment by the settlers and the army, to the point that they would hinder many events. All people's events have been postponed and cancelled.

Israeli raids in the northern West Bank have killed three Palestinians, according to authorities, as violence in the occupied territory escalates amid the war in Gaza.
Israeli forces killed one Palestinian in the town of Jenin and two others in the town of Arraba, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Saturday.
During the incursion, the Israeli army damaged infrastructure, including roads and power transformers, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
The deadly raid adds to hundreds of Palestinian casualties in the West Bank since the beginning of the Gaza war between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas.
Israeli forces have killed at least 185 Palestinians and injured 2,500 in the West Bank in little more than a month, according to Palestinian authorities.
Israeli forces are also tightening movement restrictions and carrying out mass arrests of Palestinians in the area.
Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from Ramallah, said raids have escalated significantly in the occupied West Bank in the past week.
'The raids have gotten to up to about 40 per day,' Jamjoom said. 'That's a huge increase from where they were earlier in the year, throughout 2023, when they had become an almost daily occurrence."
In addition to the raids, West Bank residents are also facing heightened violence from armed Israeli settlers.
Settlers have killed at least eight Palestinians and forced hundreds out of their homes since October 7, according to Palestinian officials.
'Now [the settlers] are a bit more emboldened by the fact that there's a war [going on],' Adam Bouloukos, director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) affairs in the West Bank, told Al Jazeera.
'And their violence is much more considerable and much more lethal.'
Israel has promised to eliminate Hamas in response to its October 7 attacks in the south, which killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials.
Since then, Israel has carried out a relentless bombing campaign in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas, killing at least 11,078 people, including more than 4,500 children, according to Palestinian officials.

'State of emergency': Six Palestinian citizens of Israel killed in one day

Six Palestinian citizens of Israel have been killed in two separate shootings, police said, the latest fatalities in a crime wave hitting the country's Palestinian minority.
Five members of the same family were killed on Wednesday in a shooting in northern Israel. The three men and two women were shot dead in broad daylight in the town of Basmat Tabun, northwest of Nazareth, police said in a statement.
The Abraham Initiatives, a Jewish-Arab advocacy and monitoring group in Israel, identified the victims as a couple and their three adult children.
Police said they were treating the incident as criminal and hunting down suspected assailants.
Earlier on Wednesday, masked gunmen ambushed and killed another Palestinian citizen of Israel, who was on his way to work in the nearby coastal city of Haifa. Police said they were investigating whether the two shootings were connected.
Authorities in al-Halisa, the Haifa neighbourhood where Wednesday's first killing took place, shuttered all schools and asked that students study from home for at least another day.
Wednesday's fatalities brought the number of Palestinian citizens of Israel killed so far this year to 188, according to the Abraham Initiatives.
Palestinians have long voiced anger at what they have said is a deliberate   in their towns and neighbourhoods - giving criminals and drug dealers free rein.
Palestinian citizens of Israel comprise about 20 percent of the country's 9.7 million population. They have also long suffered from  .
The country's far-right national security minister,  , promised to crack down on crime in Israel's Palestinian communities when he took office late last year.
But Ben-Gvir,  , has seemingly done little to bring safety to Palestinian towns and villages.
 , with more than double the number of such homicides taking place for similar periods in recent years.
Less than 10 percent of similar cases have been solved this year, the Abraham Initiatives group added, describing the surge in violence as a symptom of both police indifference and Palestinian distrust of the police.
"The prime minister must sack the minister of public security and immediately put in place a plan to address criminality in the Arab society. It's a state of emergency," the Abraham Initiatives said in a statement.
"Police do not have the willingness or the capacity," said Thabet Abu Rass, the group's director. "People are afraid to go outside. It's a very dangerous situation right now."

Why are so many Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails?

In golf carts, vans and on motorbikes, Hamas fighters have taken dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers back to the Gaza Strip after their attack on Israel on Saturday.
As Israel's fighter jets bomb the Gaza Strip in retaliation against the surprise Hamas assault, the Palestinian group has said that it plans to use the captured Israelis to strike a deal for the   in Israel's prisons.
But just how many Palestinians are currently in Israeli custody? And how many of them are children?
The Palestinians in Israel in prisons
Many would argue that all of Gaza is effectively an open-air prison — 2.2 million people blockaded by Israel in a tiny coastal enclave.
But the number of Palestinians who have actually spent time in Israeli jails too is of a similar order. Since 1967, when Israel occupied East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, it has arrested an estimated one million Palestinians, the United Nations reported  last summer.
One in every five Palestinians has been arrested and charged under the 1,600 military orders that control every aspect of the lives of Palestinians living under the Israeli military occupation. That incarceration rate doubles for Palestinian men — two in every five have been arrested.
By comparison, in the United States, the country notorious for the world's largest prison population, one in 200 people is imprisoned. The imprisonmentrate among Black Americans is more than three times the overall rate — but even then is a tiny fraction of an average Palestinian's likelihood of spending time in jail.
Palestinian Prisoner rights group Addameer has described the Israeli prison system as a 'complex of monstrous machinery in form, laws, procedures, and policiesdesigned to liquidate and kill'.
Today, the number of Palestinians currently behind Israeli bars is 5,200, including 33 women and 170 children. If tried, Palestinian prisoners are prosecuted in military courts.
So, why are there so many prisoners?
Two months after Israel occupied Palestinian and Arab territories in the 1967 war, its government issued Military Order 101 which essentially criminalised civic activities under the basis of "hostile propaganda and prohibition of incitement".
The order, which is still in use in the occupied West Bank, outlaws the participation and organisation of protests, printing and distributing political material, waving flags and other political symbols, and any activity that demonstrates sympathy for an organisation deemed illegal under military orders.
Three years later, another military order (378) was issued by the Israeli government. This established military courts, and basically outlawed all formsof Palestinian resistance to the Israeli occupation as 'terrorism'.
Hundreds of other military orders have been issued and implemented since then to curtail any Palestinian civic and political expression.
How many Israeli prisons are there detaining Palestinian prisoners?
There are 19 prisons within Israel and one inside the occupied West Bank that hold Palestinian prisoners.
Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, it is against international law for an occupying power to transfer an occupied people from the occupied territory.
"It is unlawful and cruel and the consequences for the imprisoned person and their loved ones, who are often deprived from seeing them for months, and at times for years on end, can be devastating,' Amnesty International has previously  said.
What is administrative detention?
There are 1,264 Palestinian administrative detainees, which means that they are held indefinitely behind bars without facing trial or any charges. This practice, a remnant of the British Mandate era, can be extended indefinitely based on "secret evidence", meaning that a detainee can spend months if not years in prison without being charged.
While Israel says the procedure allows authorities to hold suspects while continuing to gather evidence, critics and rights groups say the system is widely abused and denies due process.
How many Palestinian children have been arrested by Israel?
Since the outbreak of the second Intifada in 2000, more than 12,000 Palestinian children have been detained by Israeli forces.
At least 700 Palestinian children under the age of 18 from the occupied West Bank are prosecuted every year through Israeli military courts after being arrested, interrogated and detained by the Israeli army.
Addameer describes the arrest and imprisonment of children as systemic and part of a collective punishment campaign.
The most common charge is throwing stones, which is punishable by a maximum punishment of 20 years.
The children are often subjected to  , according to child rights groups. They are interrogated without the presence of a parent or lawyer, and critics have accused Israel of exploiting their detention to turn them into informants and to extort their families financially by forcing them to pay huge fines.
What are some of the Israeli military orders against Palestinian children?
Military Order 1726 states that children can be held in preventative detention for 15 days before an indictment is submitted and that a military court can extend that detention by 10 days each time for a maximum of 40 times.
Military Order 1745 stipulates that interrogation sessions of children should be audiovisually recorded in a language understood by children, but excludes children arrested under security pretexts which refers to all Palestinian child detainees.
Under Military Order 132, Palestinian children aged 16 and older were previously tried and sentenced by Israeli military courts as adults.
Furthermore, Palestinian children continue to be charged according to their age at the time of sentencing, instead of their age at the time of the alleged offence, as provided by international law.
In August 2016, Israel changed its law that stated that children under 14 could not be held criminally responsible. This was done after Israeli authorities waited for  , who was 13 years old at the time of his arrest, to turn 14 before charging him with attempted murder and sentencing him to 12 years – which was later commuted down to nine.

Palestinians stock up on essentials amid surge in Gaza food prices

Food prices skyrocketed in Gaza last month, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics has said, amid Israel's bombardment of the enclave and suffocating siege.
The bureau on Saturday called the surge in October 'unprecedented', at a time when Palestinians are taking advantage of some respite in the fighting to stock up on essential items, on the second day of a   that includes the release of some of the Israeli captives held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for   in Israeli jails.
Thousands of people were seen crowding around stalls and shops at the Nuseirat market in the central Gaza Strip, looking to secure much-needed food supplies. Across the Gaza Strip, people stood in long queues in order to buy wheat and other basic items.
The bureau said food and beverage prices had increased by 10 percent in October, while vegetables and wheat flour saw a 32 and 65 percent rise, respectively. The price of water increased by 100 percent.

Israel had suspended aid deliveries into the enclave after the conflict broke out on October 7, and restricted fuel supplies, with even bakeries rendered inactive due to the lack of wheat flour, water and fuel. The United Nations and humanitarian organisations have long warned of the 'immediate possibility of starvation' and the spread of disease.
The UN said that the  between Israel and Hamas has enabled it to scale up the delivery of food, water and medicine to the largest volume since the resumption of humanitarian aid convoys to Gaza on October 21.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said on Saturday it had delivered a convoy of 61 trucks carrying aid assistance to Gaza City and northern Gaza, whose residents were ordered by the Israeli military to evacuate.
The UN said earlier this month that people who remained in the north were resorting to 'negative coping mechanisms due to food scarcity, including skipping or reducing meals and using unsafe and unhealthy methods for making fire'.
The PRCS said Saturday's delivery was the largest since the war began. The trucks were 'loaded with food and non-food items, water, primary health care medicines, and emergency medical supplies,' it said on X.

As part of the four-day deal between Hamas and Israel,   entered Gaza on Friday, with the pause in hostilities.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said 129,000 litres (34,000 gallons) of fuel crossed into Gaza, along with four trucks carrying cooking gas for the first time since October 7.
However, aid agencies say much more is needed to assist the 2.3 million people living in the besieged enclave, calling the conditions on the ground 'catastrophic'.
More than 1.7 million people have now been forcibly displaced across the Gaza Strip, with many sheltering in UN schools, which are experiencing severe overcrowding.
According to the UN, 2.2 million people need food assistance to survive.
More than 44,000 cases of diarrhoea and 70,000 cases of respiratory infections have been reported.

After more than six weeks of fighting that has destroyed extensive areas of Gaza and killed thousands, Israel and Palestinian armed group Hamas have  .
Since October 7, when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel and killed 1,200 people, the Israeli army has been relentlessly bombarding Gaza with air and ground attacks, killing  , mostly women and children.
An estimated 1.5 million Palestinians have been displaced and forced by the Israeli army to flee to the southern areas of the Strip.
Here's what you need to know about the truce that Israel agreed to on Wednesday morning:
What have Israel and Hamas agreed to?
Both sides have agreed to a four-day pause in fighting.
In exchange, Hamas has agreed to release 50 civilian women and childrenout of the 240   abducted on October 7.
As part of the deal, Israel has agreed to release 150 Palestinian women and children from its prisons.
Qatar has said that the deal would allow an increase in the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Israel said it was willing to extend the pause beyond the four-day period, adding a day for every 10 additional hostages released by Hamas.
It is unclear whether Israel will release additional Palestinian prisoners if the truce is extended.
How did the truce happen?
The agreement was mediated by  , which had been leading negotiations between Israel and Hamas, while coordinating with other regional and global powers, including the United States and Egypt.
US President Joe Biden thanked Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt for their role in the breakthrough.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he had leaned on Biden to secure a better deal for Israel, and thanked the US president for his efforts.
Netanyahu also made it clear that the country was not ending its war on Gaza and that the stopping of fighting was only temporary.

Is the truce already in force?
No. As of Wednesday morning, fighting continued between the two sides. Qatar said that the start time of the pause would be declared within 24 hours.
How did Israel come to approve the deal?
After weeks of hectic negotiations and multiple instances when a deal appeared on the horizon before falling apart, Netanyahu called a meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday night.
After the Israeli prime minister presented the proposed deal to his ministers, only three members of his cabinet opposed it — National Security Minister  and two other members of his far-right political party.
What happens if either side breaks the truce?
Neither side is expected to hold back on restarting hostilities if the other breaks — or is perceived to have broken — any of the terms of the agreement.

Biden said in a statement that he expects Americans to be included in the 50 captives released under the deal.
What do we know about Palestinians in Israeli prisons?
Before October 7, there were about 5,200 Palestinians in Israeli prisons.
Since then, Israeli forces have arrested at least 3,000 more Palestinians during daily raids across the occupied West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem.
At least 145 of them are children, according to rights and monitoring groups.
At least 95 are women.
At least 37 are journalists.
(Al Jazeera)
What was the timeline of the deal?
On November 15,   emerging of Qatari mediators closing in on an agreement between Israel and Hamas for the release of 50 captives in Gaza in exchange for a three-day pause.

Israel's Channel 12 reported that the country's war cabinet met on Sunday and discussed that it was ready to move forward with the negotiations and tell Qatar it was ready to reach an agreement.
On Monday, US President Joe Biden said he believed a deal to free the captives was close. The White House clarified that terms had not been finalised.
The same day, Red Cross President Mirjana Spoljaric met with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Doha and had separate talks with Qatari authorities.
On Tuesday, Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq told Al Jazeera that a deal had been in talks for weeks but Netanyahu was stalling. He added that all brigades of the Palestinian resistance agreed on the deal via phone call and that Hamas had   to Qatari negotiators.
On Wednesday morning, the Israeli cabinet backed the agreement after talks on the  .
Later on Wednesday morning, Israel and Hamas independently confirmed the pause in fighting.
What's next?
James Dorsey, senior fellow at the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera that Israel's temporary truce with Hamas is just a first step in difficult negotiations ahead, with a lasting peace in Gaza still far off.
'What this [deal] tells you is how difficult things are going to be going forward. Once you get to the question of releasing Israeli military personnel held captive by Hamas these negotiations are going to become much more difficult.
'My sense is that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was caught in a bind. On the one hand domestic pressure - which wants the hostages released and wants them released now - and, on the other hand, US pressure to allow for a truce."

Spanish PM proposes talks on the establishment of a Palestinian state

November 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Spanish Prime Minister   has called for the establishment of a viable Palestinian state after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
Sanchez, whose new government was sworn in earlier this month, proposed an international peace conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during talks with Netanyahu on Thursday.
The Socialist leader also met Israeli President Isaac Herzog and was set for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank later on Thursday before travelling on to Egypt.
"Today, more than ever, we need to bring back a serious and credible prospect for peace,"Sanchezsaid after talks with Netanyahu. "Without a political settlement, we are bound to run again into a never-ending cycle of violence."
While Sanchez stressed that he backed Israel's right to defend itself following the "atrocities" carried out by Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, on October 7, he said the number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military response "is truly unbearable".
Around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed when Hamas fighters from Gaza attacked southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities, and around 240 others were taken as captives to Gaza.
Since the attack, Israel has bombarded Gaza in an air and ground assault and severely restricted supplies of water, food and fuel to the 2.3 million residents of the territory. More than 14,500 people, including more than 6,000 children, have been killed in the Israeli assault on Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities.
The last US-brokered round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014 and the prospects of a revival appear to have dimmed amid the continuing Israel-Hamas war.
Sanchez said he and unspecified colleagues had proposed holding an international peace conference with the parties as soon as possible. He said the European Union, Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had all endorsed the idea.
"It is in Israel's interest to work for peace, and today, peace means the establishment of a viable Palestinian state that includes the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, according to the UN resolutions," he said.
United States officials have said the time is not right to try to resume peace talks given the protracted intransigence of both sides.
Sanchez attended the meetings alongside his Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo. Their two countries hold the current and upcoming rotating presidencies of the Council of the European Union, respectively.
Last week, Sanchez said a Union for the Mediterranean summit in Barcelona on November 27-28 would be an "ideal place" to relaunch Israeli-Palestinian dialogue as the two sides would "sit on an equal footing" there.
Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs limited parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, are members of the Mediterranean grouping along with neighbours Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria.
UK's Cameron meets Netanyahu
In 1991, Madrid hosted a multilateral peace conference aimed at resolving the conflict through negotiations based on a "land for peace" formula, eventually leading to the 1993 Oslo interim accords that set up the PA.
But a series of follow-up negotiations aimed at creating a Palestinian state in territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war foundered on intractable differences over borders, Palestinian refugees, Israel's steady expansion of settlements on occupied land, and the status of Jerusalem.
As he was sworn in for a new term this month, Sanchez said his foreign policy priority would be to "work in Europe and in Spain to recognise the Palestinian state".
Several smaller European nations such as Sweden and Malta have recognised Palestine, but so far no major EU member has taken this step.
Sanchez governs in a minority coalition with hard-left formation Sumar. In October, Israel's embassy to Spain accused some of Sanchez's ministers of aligning themselves with Hamas after a hard-left cabinet minister called Israel's military offensive in Gaza "a genocide".
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron also met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday after visiting the south of the country. He said the agreed   was an opportunity to get some of the Israeli captives out of Gaza and that he hoped "everyone who is responsible and behind this agreement can make it happen".
"There's no hope for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, between Israel and the Arab states, if we don't eradicate this murderous movement that threatens the future of all of us," Cameron said, referring to Hamas.

Tunis, Tunisia - Tunis has become the latestArab capital to voice its support for Palestinians amid the most significant crisis to have erupted across the region in recent memory.
Following the lead of protesters inAmman,Baghdadand Cairo, around 3,000 people took to Tunis's streets on Thursday in a groundswell of solidarity for Palestinians currently facing  .
Meanwhile, in Gaza, Israel continued its sixth day of air strikes in response to Saturday's   from the Palestinian group Hamas, which resulted in hundreds killed and more than 150 Israelis held captive.
But the Israeli response has also left civilians killed, injured and displaced. Gaza's health ministry estimates that 1,537 Palestinians have died in the bombardment as of Friday morning, and an Israel-imposed   has cut off supplies of food, water, electricity and fuel to the territory, home to 2.3 million people.
Marching through a tunnel of trees on the Avenue de la Liberte in downtown Tunis, 18-year-old student Ayoub Alouj expressed concern for what he considered Israeli abuses in Gaza.
"This is a critical moment and we want to say that we're with Palestine and against the Zionist movement," he said as he and other demonstrators approached the massive synagogue in central Tunis that the march filed past.
"I have no problem with Jews," Alouj added. "Only with Zionists.'

Protesters like Alouj are part of a growing call for justice that has united countries across the Arab world.
Even government critics joined the marches in Tunis, defying an order banning them from appearing at public gatherings. Their appearance was a reflection of the surge of public support for the Palestinian cause.
On Tuesday, lawyer Ayachi Hammami was placed under such a ban for his activism work. Nevertheless, he and other critics of Tunisian   hit the streets to raise their voices in protest.
"Nothing can stop me from protesting, especially for Palestine," he told The New Arab news outletfrom the demonstrations on Thursday.
The question of Israeli violence carries   in Tunisia. In 2016, gunmen said to belong to the Israeli secret service agency Mossad tracked and killed local professor and engineer Mohamed Zouari near the Tunisian city of Sfax.
An alleged member of Hamas, Zouari is credited with designing the drones that are believed to have played a critical role in the attack on Israel last weekend.
In 1985, Israel also carried out an attack on Tunisian soil, when its jets bombed the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization outside Tunis. The United Nations Security Council condemned the bombing, though the United States abstained from a vote on the matter.

On the streets of Tunis on Thursday, 73-year-old Ibrahim Boukarisaid he has been marching against Israel almost as long as Palestine has been occupied.
Many refer to the start of the occupation in 1948 as the  , an event that saw hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced as the state of Israel was established.
That history and its legacy has been a through-line in Boukari's life.
'Sometimes, like today, it feels very prominent. Other times, there's nothing," he told Al Jazeera through a translator, speaking to the ebb and flow of the violence.
Samir Elouaer's hoarse voice was among those mixing in with the din of Thursday's protest. Behind dark glasses, his near-sightless eyes stared dead ahead, as he held a flag before him like a shield.
'Countries like America are part of this," Elouaer said through a translator. The US remains one of Israel's  , and it contributes about $3bn in aid to the country every year. 'They led us to this. They contributed.'
Some protesters took aim at the US's steadfast support for Israel, which has been accused by human rights organisations like Amnesty International of imposing a   on Palestinians.

"Israel has committed many horrendous crimes, from the slaughter of children to acts of genocide," 28-year-old Youssef Khrairef said through a translator, his black-and-white keffiyeh hanging loosely from his shoulders.
He stood in the Tunis city centre among a small group of fellow lawyers, their dress robes — worn at the request of their union — setting them apart in the unseasonable heat.
"The one time that Palestinians decide to defend themselves and take the fight to Israel, everyone took the side of Israel against Palestine," Khrairef said.
For President Saied, the war in Gaza has provided some vindication for his unflinching stance on Israel.
During the  , Saied called any move to normalise relations with Israel"treasonous". He has continued to championTunisia's unwavering support for Palestine's rightto resist occupation.
But Thursday's massive show of support for the Palestinian cause may not translate into boosted approval ratings for Saied's government. His administration faces strong criticism over rising food prices and shortages of staple goods.

On Avenue Habib Bourguiba in central Tunis, history teacherOumeima Aissaoui acknowledged Saied's support for Palestine. But she nevertheless expressed concern about Tunisia's domestic plight.
"We're facing an economic crisis, and it's getting worse and worse all the time," she said.
"Kais Saied will always be known for what he did in July 2021,' Aissaoui added, referencing   when the president dismissed the prime minister and shuttered parliament in a move his critics labelled a coup.
But, she said, Saied's stance on Israel was a mark in his favour. 'On this, he probably made the right decision.'

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier says Germans of Arab and Palestinian descent should take steps to distance themselves from anti-Semitism and the Palestinian group  as pro-Palestinian demonstrations in the country have triggered controversy.
In remarks on Wednesday, Steinmeier said he was concerned that fighting between   could have a disruptive effect on social relations in Germany.
"Speak for yourselves and make a clear stand against terror," Steinmeier said, adding that Palestinians had the right to express anguish over civilians killed in Israel's attacks on Gaza but that this freedom did not include 'calls for the destruction of the state of Israel'.
The comments have drawn criticism, adding to concerns that efforts by   to contain tensions over the war that began on October 7 may be crossing over into discrimination against Palestinians.
'Jews should never be made to account for Israel's actions,' Hugh Lovatt, a foreign policy analyst with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said in a social media post. 'So why should Germany ask its Muslim citizens to account for Hamas's?'
Steinmeier insisted that there must be no anti-Muslim racism or 'general suspicion against Muslims'.
This month, Germany announced a   on the activities of Hamas and ordered the disbanding of a pro-Palestine group accused of spreading anti-Israel and anti-Semitic ideas.Hamas is already designated as a 'terrorist' organisation in the country.
On Tuesday, a report by the German Centre for Integration and Migration Research (DeZIM) found that nearly 40 percent of German Muslim men said they had experienced racism or discrimination when dealing with police and public offices.
Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities across the world have expressed anxieties about increasing discrimination and even violence as fighting rages in Gaza.
In the United States, a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy was   by a landlord who police said was angry about events in the Middle East.
In mid-October, a Jewish synagogue in Berlin was firebombed, prompting German Chancellor   to state that Germany stands 'united for the protection of Jews'.
Palestinian residents of Germany said authorities have   on peaceful protests, which are banned entirely in many parts of the country. In Berlin, schools have also been given authority to ban traditional Palestinian clothing, such as the keffiyeh headdress.
German military exports to Israel have risen tenfold in the past year, the Reuters news agency reported on Wednesday, with Berlin fast-tracking permits even as Israel's war in Gaza, which Palestinian authorities said has killed more than 10,569 people, comes under  .
Israel said it is working to dismantle Hamas, which launched   on southern Israel on October 7, which Israeli authorities said killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.

Two Israelis have been shot dead in the occupied West Bank by a suspected Palestinian gunman.
Israel's ambulance service said two men - ages 60 and 29 - were shot near the Palestinian village of  . Paramedics said the two people were targeted inside a carwash.
"Both were unconscious and had sustained gunshot wounds to their bodies," a spokesperson for the ambulance service said.
The Israeli army spokesperson for Arabic media, Avichay Adraee, confirmed two Israelis had been killed.
#عاجل  شبهة لارتكاب عملية اطلاق نار تخريبية استهدفت عدد من المواطنين الاسرائيليين في منطقة #حوارة  وأسفرت عن مقتل مواطنيْن إسرائيلييْن. قوات جيش الدفاع باشرت بملاحقة المشتبه فيهم ونشرت الحواجز في المنطقة pic.twitter.com/xroJz5rO1U

Translation: Urgent – suspected terrorist shooting attack targeted a number of Israeli citizens in Huwara, leading to the killing of two. The IDF is tracking suspects and has erected checkpoints in the area.
The situation in the West Bank has been particularly volatile over the past 15 months with stepped up deadly Israeli raids and rampages by Jewish settlers on Palestinian villages.
Huwara has been the scene of   by Israeli settlers and retribution in the form of Palestinian shooting attacks over the past few months.
Saturday's shooting comes the same day a Palestinian man shot by Israeli forces earlier this week during a raid in the occupied West Bank succumbed to wounds.
Mohammed Abu Asaab was "seriously injured in the head" on Wednesday in Balata refugee camp on the outskirts of the northern West Bank city of Nablus and died Saturday, the official news agency Wafa reported.
Abu Asaab was hit during clashes that erupted when Israeli "undercover forces" surrounded a house in the camp, it said.
His death brought to 218 the number of Palestinians killed in violence this year linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Prospects of reviving US-brokered peace talks that collapsed almost a decade ago and that aimed to establish a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, remain dim.

Israel arrests Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi in occupied West Bank raids

Israeli forces have arrested Ahed Tamimi, a prominent 22-year-old Palestinian activist, for "inciting terrorism".
They announced the arrest on Monday following another round of overnight raids and fighting in the occupied West Bank. Violence has been spilling over into the territory since the start of the Israel-Hamas war last month.
Al Jazeera correspondent Zein Basravi reported multiple raids by the Israeli army across the West Bank, including in the village of Nabi Saleh, near Ramallah, where   was arrested.
The activist "was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence and terrorist activities", an army spokesperson said. "Tamimi was transferred to Israeli security forces for further questioning."
Nariman Tamimi, the activist's mother, told Anadolu news agency that Israeli forces had searched the house and confiscated the mobile phones of the family members. Her father Bassem Tamimi was arrested by Israeli forces during a raid in the town last week, with no information of his whereabouts.
Israeli media reported that Ahed Tamimi had called for the murder of settlers in the West Bank in an Instagram post. An Israeli security source shared the alleged Instagram post with AFP when questioned about the reason for her arrest.
However, Nariman denied that her daughter wrote the post. "There are dozens of (online) pages in Ahed's name with her photo, with which she has no connection," she said.
The Israeli army celebrated Ahed Tamimi's arrest, publishing a picture on Facebook and asking: 'Where is her smile now?'
Family of activists
Tamimi and her family members are well-known activists and have led Nabi Saleh's non-violent resistance for nearly a decade.
Her father has been arrested numerous times by Israeli forces and has spent at least four years in prison.
Ahed Tamimi became an icon of Palestinian resistance since a video of her 2012 confrontation with an Israeli soldier, who had arrived at the family house to arrest her brother, went viral.
She was previously arrested by the Israeli army in December 2017 following further confrontations, alongside her mother and 20-year-old cousin Nour.
Indicted on 12 charges, including assault, incitement and past instances of stone-throwing, she was jailed for eight months.
Overnight raids
Ahed Tamimi's arrest came amid another night of Israeli raids and fighting in the occupied West Bank, with the occupying forces intensifying nightly raids on Palestinian homes, villages and cities in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Reporting from Ramallah, Basravi said it was a hectic night, with multiple cities across the West Bank witnessing raids and open clashes between the army and armed Palestinian fighters. Footage showed roads and cars destroyed.
At the Shuafat refugee camp, one of the largest military raids took place. It is known to be home to several Palestinian armed groups. The Israeli army arrested an adviser to the Palestinian Authority (PA) government and Fatah member Rafat Alian was detained during a live interview.
Israel has arrested about 1,740 Palestinians in overnight raids  in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7.
Most are being held under laws and military orders that allow detention without trial or charge.

Gaza truce holds into second day, more captives to be released

November 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Palestinians in the war-stricken Gaza Strip are experiencing a second day of relative calm absent of Israeli attacks as a temporary pause in fighting holds.
After almost 50 days of constant Israeli bombardment that has killed nearly 15,000 Palestinians in the enclave, a   from early Friday and appeared to be proceeding unhindered on Saturday.
But the United Nations said on Friday that 'the 24 hours prior to the pause witnessed an intensification of Israeli strikes from air, land and sea' throughout Gaza.
The temporary truce has allowed the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza – where no place has proven safe  in the past seven weeks – to experience their first night of sleep without the fear of being killed in an Israeli air raid.
It also provided some time for families to try to secure supplies of food and water, which have become scarce amid the unrelenting assault on the besieged enclave.
Some chose to go back to the northern parts of Gaza – which have seen the worst of the fighting between the Israeli army and Hamas – amid a ground invasion of the area by Israeli troops supported by heavy machinery and air strikes. Several Palestinians were killed on their way north as Israel ordered them to stay in the south.
Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said some Palestinians had a chance to visit surviving family members.
'It's also an opportunity for those who lost loved ones and friends or family members to pay them respects and offer them a prayer, as funeral processions and proper burials were not permissible under heavy bombardment and relentless air strikes,' Mahmoud said.
More captives to be released
Palestinian journalist Ismail Abu Omar on Saturday shared a video – verified by Al Jazeera – that shows a man searching for his family's clothes from under the rubble of their Gaza home, which was destroyed in the Israeli onslaught.
Palestinian photojournalist Magdi Fathi has documented the testimonies of several displaced women who say nothing is left of their homes in Khan Younis amid Israel's bombardment of the enclave.
'I came to my house to take out some things, but I did not find anything. The Israeli army destroyed the place in a way that we did not expect,' said one woman, who was among the thousands who returned to their neighbourhoods after the start of the truce yesterday.
Another woman, a resident of Khuzaa in eastern Khan Younis, said she was 'shocked' by what she found. 'The destruction is very big,' she said.
Khan Younis is one of the southern cities where residents of northern Gaza were ordered by Israel to evacuate to, but it has been  by Israeli forces.
As part of the truce,   were released on Friday, 13 of whom are Israelis. More are expected to be let go, as the Israeli prime minister's office said it had received a list of captives to be released on Saturday.
Friday also saw the release of   who had been detained by Israel, some of them for years. They returned to their homes in the occupied West Bank.
During the four days of the pause, at least 50 people are expected to be freed by Hamas, leaving an estimated 190 captives in Gaza. In exchange, 150 Palestinians are expected to be released by Israel.
The truce, which could potentially be extended, allowed the first aid deliveries since the start of the war to arrive in northern Gaza.

Afro-Dabke, where Palestine and Cameroon meet to dance

September 28th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Ramallah, occupied West Bank - The energetic tempo, the stomping, and the ancient traditions.
Dabke has a lot in common with various African dances, so Palestinian choreographer Sharaf DarZaid decided to combine the two.
"I felt African folklore is one of the closest forms of dancing to Dabke in the world," the 36-year-old father of two tells Al Jazeera in his office at Ramallah's Popular Art Centre (PAC) in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Dabke, literally meaning "to stomp the feet" in Arabic, is a popular folklore line dance native to Palestine, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, widely performed on joyous occasions like weddings.
Folklore dancing is different to other genres of dance – it is an expression of a people's traditions, cultures, and everyday life.
DarZaid had been dancing Dabke since he was 11 years old and teaching it to others since he was 19, but it was only when he took African dancing classes in Europe that he began to understand Dabke in a deeper way, he says.
In 2014, DarZaid made friends with Serge Tsakap , a dancer of Cameroonian origin, during a five-month dance scholarship in the French capital, Paris.
"When he showed me moves mimicking how they cut sugarcane, I realised how similar they are to moves in Dabke inspired by cutting wheat with a scythe," says DarZaid, his eyes lighting up with excitement.
DarZaid says he found parallels in Cameroonian dances, inspired by farming and animals.
"They have moves related to praying for rainfall like we do, and others mimicking animals such as horses and birds.
'There are also moves inspired by the act of collecting water from wells, just like how we use jugs at springs. Or how they sieve wheat, and how we used hand mills to make flour,' he explains.

In addition to similarities in the inspiration, DarZaid saw resemblances in the style of dancing.
"What sets folklore dancing apart is that it is a bit rough. I call it elegant roughness. You cannot dance Dabke and be extremely elegant like in ballet. It is more popular, more about presence, charisma, personality, energy and liveliness," all characteristics he found in African dancing.
The dances' role in society goes beyond the moves themselves. "African dancing and Dabke are a popular practice that brings people together. Ballet, contemporary and jazz, for example, do not do this," says DarZaid.
"Even from a political aspect: in Africa they use dance, and still do, to fight oppression. South Africa is the biggest example of this with apartheid," he points out.
For Palestinians, he adds: "Our struggle with the occupier [Israel] is not only about the land … It is also an existential and identity struggle. The popular Dabke dance is a part of our identity, it is artistic, cultural heritage, and we hold on to it as a form of artistic and cultural resistance."
'I found myself in it'
After combining the two genres, DarZaid and Tsakap held classes in Paris and then embarked on an Afro-Dabke tour across France. When he returned to Palestine in 2014, DarZaid began giving Afro-Dabke classes at the PAC and has been doing so since.
While Palestinians of all backgrounds have taken DarZaid's classes, they have meant more to some Palestinians than others.
Shaden Qous, a 21-year-old Dabke dancer, is one of a few hundred Afro-Palestinians living in the Old City of Jerusalem, which lies under Israeli occupation. She has been attending DarZaid's classes since 2015.
"My experience with Afro-Dabke is particularly special because I am of African origin," says Qous, noting that her grandparents immigrated to Palestine from Chad.
"It wasn't just another style of dance. I felt a connection with it. I found myself in it," the fourth-year law student at Birzeit University tells Al Jazeera.
Shaden Qous, 21, says Afro-Dabke is very meaningful to her as an Afro-Palestinian [Zena Al Tahhan/Al Jazeera]
A small community of about 350-450 Palestinians originally from Chad, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan live in the Old City, while hundreds more live in Jericho in the occupied West Bank and in the besieged Gaza Strip. Most immigrated during the British occupation of Palestine (1917-48), while others came to Palestine as early as the 12th century.
While Qous has family in Chad, she has no connection with them. The experience of Afro-Dabke, she says, was a chance for her to get to know herself better.
"As part of the African community, I think it's important to find even a small connection to remind you of who you are, and to explore your place in this culture that you are a part of, and which forms your personality and your identity," she points out.
"I am Palestinian first, of African origin. Afro-Dabke is the same thing: my dancing identity is that I am a dabeekeh [Dabke dancer] first," explains Qous, who has been dancing Dabke since she was six years old.
Dina Amin, a 27-year-old filmmaker and dancer living in Ramallah, has attended all his classes since returning from studying abroad in 2018.
"Afro-Dabke is very special to me. I do it when I want to be happy. Some days, when I wake up, I put on some Afrobeats and dance, even if just for five minutes," Amin tells Al Jazeera.

Amin hopes Afro-Dabke will spread to other parts of the world.
"This will display our Palestinian identity to the world and build bridges and awareness. I think that was Sharaf's intention."
Jerusalema
In 2020, the song Jerusalema by producer Master KG and singer-songwriter Nomcebo Zikode from South Africa, went viral, spawning a dance challenge with dozens of groups performing their own versions of the dance.
DarZaid choreographed a Palestinian version  featuring Afro-Dabke, working with South African-Palestine solidarity groups as well as different dance troupes in Palestine to produce it. Dancers from five governorates – Gaza, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Jenin – performed in it, with more than 130 Palestinian dancers in total.
The widely shared video was watched more than half a million times on YouTube alone.
"I think the Jerusalema dance challenge was a turning point for Afro-Dabke," says Qous, who trained the Jerusalem dancers for the video and appeared in it.
"This simple experience opened so many doors for us. It began building bridges.
"I think Afro-Dabke is very important, it built relationships between us and people in Africa. This is something we must think about as Palestinians: How can we strengthen relationships with the outside world to serve our cause?"

'Extinction': Gaza Christians fear for community's survival amid Israel war

Gaza Strip – When Israeli bombs began pummelling the once-bustling streets of Gaza City, Diana Tarazi and her family fled to the Holy Family Church, the only Roman Catholic place of worship in the Gaza Strip.
The 38-year-old Palestinian Christian, her husband and three children huddled alongside fellow churchgoers and Muslim neighbours and friends, lulling their children to an exhausted sleep amid the sounds of bombing, muttering soft words of encouragement to each other.
'Together, we try to get through the war until it ends – and we survive it,' Tarazi told Al Jazeera.
Their sense of safety was shattered on October 19, when Israel   the nearby Church of Saint Porphyrius, Gaza's oldest, killing at least 18 people. The Israeli army said in a statement that the church was not the target of the attack.
'The missile fell directly on it,' Tarazi said of the Greek Orthodox site. 'We cannot believe that the church was not their aim.'
Two days earlier, an   at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital – an Anglican institution located a few blocks away – killed and injured hundreds, according to Palestinian health authorities. Hamas blamed the blast on an Israeli air raid, while Tel Aviv claimed it was caused by a malfunctioning rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group based in Gaza.
Despite Gaza City and adjacent refugee camps being surrounded by Israeli ground forces, and air raids pounding the area, Tarazi is refusing to leave. 'We do not accept displacement from our country, our land and our churches,' she said.
'I will not leave the church except to the grave.'

'Threat of extinction'
At least 10,569 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7.
Only 800 to 1,000 Christians are believed to still live in Gaza, constituting the   in the world, dating back to the first century.
Mitri Raheb, an Evangelical Lutheran pastor and founder of Dar al-Kalima University in Bethlehem, said it was conceivable that the current conflict would spell the end of its long history in this strip of land.
'This community is under threat of extinction,' Raheb told Al Jazeera. 'I'm not sure if they will survive the Israeli bombing, and even if they survive, I think many of them will want to emigrate.'
'We know that within this generation, Christianity will cease to exist in Gaza,' he added.
The broader region of historic Palestine is the birthplace of Christianity, as well as the setting for many of the events in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.
In the fourth century, Gaza, located along a major trade route with access to a vibrant port and a cosmopolitan city, became a major Christian mission hub. After 1948, when the state of Israel was established and 700,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homes in what became known as the Nakba, or 'catastrophe', more Palestinian Christians joined the community on the coastal enclave.
Estimates have indicated that the number of Christians in Gaza dropped in recent years from the 3,000 registered in 2007, when Hamas assumed complete control of the strip, triggering Israel's blockade and accelerating the departure of Christians from the poverty-stricken enclave.
Attacks in West Bank 'quadrupled'
In the West Bank, Christians are on a stronger footing with more than 47,000 people living there, according to a 2017 census.
But violence and persecution have unsettled the community there too. 'Attacks on clergy and churches had quadrupled this year compared to last year,' Raheb, whose academic institution documents such events, said.
On January 1, days after Israel swore in the most   in the country's history, two unidentified men broke into Jerusalem's Protestant Mount Zion Cemetery and   more than 30 graves, pushing over cross-shaped tombstones and smashing them with rocks.
On January 26, a   of Israeli settlers attacked an Armenian bar in the Christian quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, shouting 'Death to Arabs … Death to Christians.'
A couple of days later, Armenians leaving a memorial service in the Armenian Quarter were attacked by Israeli settlers carrying sticks. An Armenian was pepper-sprayed as settlers scaled the walls of the Armenian convent, trying to take down its flag, which had a cross on it.
The attacks have continued to escalate, in tandem with Israeli attempts to 'silence any voices coming from Palestinians inside Israel', Raheb said.
'They are Jewish terrorist settlers, but the international community doesn't recognise them as such because it is part of the same colonial [mindset],' he said, adding that he worried the constant threat of violence would eventually drive out Christianity from the Holy Land.
'My children were disfigured, dead'
Back in Gaza, Ramez al-Souri is trying to wrap his head around the deaths of his three children, Suhail, Majd and Julie, in the Church of Saint Porphyrius bombing.
'The building contained civilians who did not belong to them,' he said, referring to the Palestinian group Hamas, which launched the surprise attack in southern Israel on October 7 that led to Israel's bombing.
Al-Souri had hoped his loved ones would be safe in a holy site, but not even the sanctity of its premises could shield his family from Israeli bombardment. The Israeli army is known to have also targeted UN schools sheltering displaced women and children, as well as hospitals, ambulances and aid supplies.
'My three children came out disfigured from the effects of the missile and shrapnel,' he said, still visibly in shock days later.
'I cannot believe that I will not talk and play with them again in my life.'

Palestinians in Lebanon ready to fight Israel, if Hezbollah helps them

October 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Beirut, Lebanon — Palestinian factions in Lebanon are eager to open a second front against Israel if the Shia-backed group Hezbollah leads the charge, fighters and analysts said.
'Wherever [Israel] is ready for [the fight] to happen, it will happen,' said Ahmed Habet, a member of the Palestinian party Fatah in Burj al-Barajneh, a refugee camp in Lebanon's capital Beirut.
'I'm the blood of my homeland. I live for my homeland. I don't live for the future,' he added.
An all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah - backed by Palestinian factions - is a possible scenario that could drag Lebanon and the region into a catastrophic conflict.
Since Saturday, more than 700 Israelis and 500 Palestinians have been killed following Hamas's surprise operation from the Gaza Strip, a piece of land that it governs and that Israel has besieged for 16 years. Rights groups describe Gaza - home to two million people - as the "world's largest open-air prison."
On Monday, Israel announced a 'total blockade' of the coastal enclave, cutting off supplies of water, food and electricity in an act of collective punishment that, under international law, represents a crime against humanity.
Unlike fighters in Gaza, branches of Palestinian factions in Lebanon such as Hamas, Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) can not sustain an assault against Israel on their own.
Enter Hezbollah, which   into the occupied Shebaa Farms on Sunday. Israel responded with artillery strikes as it continued to battle Hamas fighters inside southern Israel while bombing the Gaza Strip indiscriminately.
Both sides may not be able to avoid - and may even welcome - a major escalation, said some analysts. Whether a broader conflagration actually unfolds could depend on the next steps Israel takes — at home, and against the Gaza Strip, they said.
'A conflict on that scale will be much more likely if [Israeli Prime Minister] Benjamin Netanyahu is able to form a unity government,' said Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow with Carnegie Middle East Center, a Beirut-based think-tank.
'[Netanyahu] needs to feel secure politically to engage on all fronts,' he added.
Room for escalation?
Hezbollah may also launch a direct attack if Israel seriously escalates its operations on the Gaza Strip, according to Ahmed Abed, an official for Hamas's branch in Lebanon.
'Hezbollah … decided that they will engage [Israel] if the retaliation against Gaza is excessive. They said they are coordinating with the leadership of [Hamas] in Palestine and that they will intervene at the right time [if need be],' he told Al Jazeera.
Netanyahu has vowed to turn parts of Gaza into rubble and warned residents in the enclave - nearly half of whom are children - to 'get out' now. Rights groups and experts have noted that civilians in Gaza have nowhere to flee because of the blockade.
That hasn't stopped Israel from escalating bombardment on Gaza and amassing 100,000 troops for a possible ground assault.
Hezbollah is capable of launching a sophisticated attack if it chooses, according to Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based expert with the Atlantic Council.
'The Hamas operation is bigger by far than any single operation carried out by Hezbollah [against Israel], although the tactics Hamas used were straight from Hezbollah's guidebook,' he said. 'Hezbollah has been training for these kinds of border-breaching missions since at least 2007.'
Blanford added that he doesn't predict a larger confrontation erupting between Israel and Hezbollah, but that it can't be ruled out.
'This is the big question. At this early stage, I would say all bets are off,' he told Al Jazeera.

Fed up with exile
Lebanon maintains a number of discriminatory laws that prohibit Palestinians from working in high-skilled professions, repairing basic infrastructure in the camps and applying for citizenship in the country.
Lebanon's political class defends these restrictions by claiming that any concessions made to Palestinians - who are mostly Sunni Muslims - will encourage their naturalisation and tip the fragile sectarian balance of the country.
The policies have impoverished about 93 percent of Palestinians in Lebanon, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
Many Palestinians dream of returning to the land that their grandparents were expelled from during the creation of Israel in 1948. 'The situation for Palestinians in Lebanon is really difficult unfortunately and the ones that remain in the camps are fed up after nearly 80 years of being here,' a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who was not authorised to give his name, told Al Jazeera in Shatila refugee camp in Beirut.
'People just want to return home,' he said.
On Monday, some Palestinian fighters reportedly crossed from Lebanon into Israel. The Israeli military said they killed the fighters, while Hezbollah denied involvement in the operation.

Igniting conflict?
In the past, Palestinian factions in Lebanon have  rockets towards the Shebaa Farms, yet the damage has often been minimal.
After the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, the former often retaliated on the camps with precision strikes or along the Lebanese and Israeli borderlands, often in an attempt to send a message without provoking a second war with Hezbollah.
But Israel may respond in full force today if Palestinian factions fire any rockets from Lebanon, said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center.
He added that Israel used to differentiate between attacks coming from the Palestinian camps and those launched by Hezbollah, but that it may be less inclined to do that now.
'Israel used to be risk averse and prefer precision attacks [in Lebanon] than all-out war that impacts their economy and security. But with Israeli cities supremely impacted [by Hamas attacks from Gaza], there is no need for caution on Netanyahu's side,' Hage Ali said.
'I think the Israeli response [to any attack from Lebanon] would be of a different magnitude.'
However, several members of Palestinian factions in Lebanon said that they need a green light from Hezbollah to initiate an attack.
Others said they will support Hezbollah if it engages in war, yet the group has its own considerations such as popular opinion in Lebanon, which is against any escalation.
'We are ready [to fight Israel] at any time,' said Habet, the Fatah member from Burj al-Barajneh camp. 'Palestinians in Lebanon are suffering from living on land that is not ours. We are all looking forward to the next life.'

Anti-Palestinian sentiment rises amid bipartisan US support for Israel

November 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - Anti-Palestinian sentiment is on the rise in the United States, with politicians from both major political parties backing Israel's   despite the mounting Palestinian death toll and growing accusations of war crimes.
Last week, the war in Gaza dominated the third Republican  , where competing candidates were unanimous in their support of Israel.
"I'm sick of hearing the media, I'm sick of hearing other people blame Israel just for defending itself," one of those candidates, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, told the audience.
Such statements cropped up throughout the two-hour event, even when the candidates were discussing topics unrelated to the crisis. But Palestinians were barely ever mentioned, despite a death toll in Gaza that has ticked past 11,000.
In fact, the only time a candidate said "Palestinian" or "Palestine" was when DeSantis bragged about banning a Palestinian student advocacy group from state universities.
Advocates say this is indicative of a wider trend of US politicians — across ideological lines — justifying and denying Israeli atrocities in Gaza.
"There is a bipartisan effort to dehumanise the Palestinian people," said Ahmad Abuznaid, the executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USPCR).
Abuznaid cited recent episodes in US politics that he said underscore hostility towards Palestinians. They include Democratic President Joe Biden   over the accuracy of the Palestinian death count and attacks on Palestinian American Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib for her criticism of Israel's military offensive.
"Whether they fail to mention Palestinians, question our death tolls, attack our students and protests, or   Palestinian American representative in Congress, their attempts to silence us won't work,"Abuznaid said.
"As much as they wish us to disappear, we are here and will be here, and they will be seeing much more of us moving forward."
Hostility in Congress
At Wednesday's debate, DeSantis and Nikki Haley, a former ambassador to the United Nations, used similar language to push Israel to take strong action in Gaza.
"Finish the job once and for all with these butchers, Hamas," DeSantis said, referring to the Palestinian group that launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7.
Haley echoed that sentiment, saying, "Finish them. Finish them," in response to a question about whether she would urge a "humanitarian pause" during the fighting.
Former New Jersey Governor   — another Republican presidential candidate — followed his appearance in the debate with a visit to Israel on Sunday, where he likewise rejected calls for ending the violence.
A bipartisan delegation of US congress members, including the top lawmakers on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also made a solidarity trip to Israel this past weekend.
Ohio Republican Max Miller, who has faced outrage for saying that Palestine will be turned into a "parking lot", accompanied key Democrats on that visit and posted a photo of the group with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Ambassador to Israel Jacob Lew.
Here is my statement as I head home from #Israel . #StandWithIsrael pic.twitter.com/wcnnmLEp9I
- Congressman Max Miller (@RepMaxMiller) November 12, 2023
Advocates have warned that comments like Miller's could be interpreted as a call for mass violence against the Palestinian people.
But Miller is hardly alone in his sentiments. Congressman Brian Mast suggested earlier this month that there are no innocent Palestinian civilians. "I don't think we would so lightly throw around the term 'innocent Nazi civilians' during World War II,"   on the House floor.
Such comments did not provoke a rebuke in the House of Representatives. However, the chamber did vote to censure its sole Palestinian American member,  , over her criticism of Israel.
Twenty-two Democrats, including the former chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Debbie Wasserman Schultz, joined Republicans in supporting the symbolic punishment, which passed 234 to 188.
Attacks against Tlaib have continued after the censure vote. On Sunday, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn baselessly accused Tlaib of having "alleged ties to Hamas" and "calling for a genocide against the Jewish people".
Rashida Tlaib has alleged ties to Hamas.
Based on these allegations, it's sadly not surprising she's calling for a genocide against the Jewish people.
- Sen. Marsha Blackburn (@MarshaBlackburn) November 12, 2023
Tlaib is one of more than a dozen House Democrats  to call for a   in Gaza, out of a chamber that contains 435 voting members.
Meanwhile, other congressional Democrats have voiced opposition to ceasefire efforts, similar to their Republican colleagues. Democratic Senator  , for instance, waved an Israeli flag as he walked by protesters demanding a ceasefire on Capitol Hill last week.
To highlight the solid bipartisan support for Israel, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has been sharing videos of left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders expressing opposition to a ceasefire in Gaza.
Sanders is usually one of AIPAC's most vocal critics, often rebuking the pro-Israel lobby group for spending millions of dollars   to undermine progressive candidates.
'All of them'
Anti-Palestinian sentiment is also appearing in US politics at the state level. In Florida last week, when State Representative Angie Nixon questioned how many dead Palestinians would be enough to end the violence, her fellow lawmaker Michelle Salzman responded by saying, "All of them."
Nixon had introduced a resolution urging a ceasefire but the measure failed in a 104-2 vote.
Rasha Mubarak, a Palestinian-American organiser from Florida, called Salzman's comments "vile" and "disturbing".
"It's interesting because when the only Palestinian member of Congress calls for an end to the violence and a ceasefire, she's literally  ," Mubarak told Al Jazeera, referring to Tlaib.
"And then we have people in the Florida Legislature, but also people in Congress, who have called for the erasure of the Palestinian people."
Mubarak said support for Israel appears to unite the US political spectrum — with the exception of a minority of lawmakers who are "connecting the dots" between Palestinian liberation, global human rights and injustices at home.
But Mubarak added that Palestinian rights supporters are not discouraged by the pro-Israel consensus in US politics. She noted the   across the country in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
"The movements and the masses of people — and the rare people who are serving in Congress and in state, local, federal positions — are trying to interrupt and disrupt the status quo," she said, referring to Palestinian rights supporters.
Mubarak also warned that Democrats are ignoring and alienating certain members of their base with their stance towards Israel's military offensive.
"What we're seeing is people committing to not voting for Biden, not voting down ballot, not voting for Democrats that weren't right on this issue," she said. "I don't think this time around people are going to forget. People remember."
Abuznaid, of the USPCR, echoed Mubarak's comments, saying that unwavering support for the Israeli government could fracture the political left and estrange the Palestinian rights movement.
"The bipartisan support is a challenge for the movement, but the cracks in the system are deepening," he told Al Jazeera.
"Our movement is larger than ever and growing daily. US complicity in the Israeli genocide of Palestinians will be another lasting stain in this nation's troubled history. Palestinian Americans remain undeterred and will push until there is a ceasefire and a free Palestine."

The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine, Nayef al-Sudairi, is about to present his credentials to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
Al-Sudairi and his accompanying delegation arrived in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday through the Karama crossing from Jordan on a two-day official visit that will end on Wednesday.
He is scheduled to meet with Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki as well as Abbas and Prime Minister Muhammad Shtayyeh.
On Monday, the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates welcomed the visit of the Saudi ambassador, considering it "a historic milestone for developing fraternal relations between the two sister countries".
'We welcome his excellency the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the State of Palestine, who will present his official credentials,' PLO Secretary-General Hussein al-Sheikh said, according to Palestinian news agency WAFA.
Presenting credentials
Last August, al-Sudairi, who is Saudi Arabia's current ambassador to Jordan, was appointed non-resident envoy to Palestine and consul general in Jerusalem.
A copy of his credentials was presented on August 12 to Majdi Al-Khalidi, diplomatic adviser to the Palestinian president,at a ceremony at the Embassy of Palestine in Amman, Jordan, in the presence of Atallah Khairi, ambassador of Palestine to Jordan.
His credentials identified al-Sudairi as "Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz to the State of Palestine, and Consul General of the Kingdom in Jerusalem", according to WAFA.
At the time,   of establishing a Saudi consulate in Jerusalem, with Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen saying al-Sudairi could meet PA representatives in Jerusalem but would have no fixed presence.
Israel claims Jerusalem as its own capital, a status recognised by the United States under then-President Donald Trump in 2017 but not by the international community.
Israeli authorities prohibit any Palestinian diplomatic activity in the city.
The first Saudi ambassador to Palestine
Al-Sudairi will be Saudi Arabia's first ambassador to Palestine.
The appointment of the Saudi ambassador comes amid reports that the Gulf kingdom is mulling official diplomatic relations with Israel in response to US pressure.
However, according to US, Israeli, and Saudi officials, such a deal is still   off because of a number of complex concerns, such as Saudi nuclear power development and Israeli operations in the occupied West Bank.
Riyadh has repeatedly stated that it will adhere to the Arab League's position of not having relations with Israel until the Palestinian crisis is resolved.

Deadly assault on Jenin refugee camp as West Bank raids intensify

At least 10 Palestinians have been killed and 20 others injured during a raid by Israeli forces in Jenin city and refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Ministry of Health has said.
Intense fighting was reported in the camp on Thursday. Black smoke was seen rising over the city amid multiple explosions and gunfire.
"Occasionally, you can hear gunshots, there are explosions, and you can listen to an Israeli military drone overhead," Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith reported from Jenin. "It all started in the early hours of this morning with a raid on the camp. Nothing unusual about that - raids are a fact of life in the occupied West Bank, particularly here in Jenin."
"But we're told the military came in and left behind special forces who were looking for Palestinian fighters. Once they were spotted, the special forces called for backup, and this major gun battle has been going on since then," Smith said.
Israel's military said it was conducting counterterrorism raids in Jenin, but gave no further details.
"The Israeli army will always say they are going after what they call 'Palestinian terrorists', and that's the purpose of these raids. But since October 7, they have stepped up operations. While they're happening all over the occupied West Bank, most of them are here in Jenin, where there are different armed groups," according to Smith.
Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that a large number of Israeli troops entered the camp, accompanied by a bulldozer. Snipers positioned themselves on rooftops as the bulldozer proceeded to destroy roads and infrastructure.
Palestinian news outlet Quds Network posted footage of the moments after Israeli forces bombed a house in the Jenin camp.
In the video posted to social media, smoke can be seen billowing out of a building after it was hit by what the network says was an Israeli drone. Live shots were fired in the ensuing clashes.
'Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank have intensified in the last three hours,' Al Jazeera's Mohammed Jamjoom reported from Ramallah.
'Witnesses in Jenin are reporting explosions, at least five in the last half hour alone, and attribute them to armed Israeli drones,' he added.
'Israeli forces have also dropped leaflets saying that the raids will only intensify.'
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said a paramedic was injured with live bullets when an ambulance came under fire during the raid.

Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, has condemned the deadly raid on the densely populated camp, where about 14,000 people live.
'The occupation that suffers defeat in Gaza will also suffer defeat in Jenin and will not succeed in breaking the will of our people from Gaza to the West Bank,' the group said in a statement.
Dozens of Palestinians have been killed in recent months by Israeli forces in Jenin, particularly in the city's   where armed groups are present alongside tens of thousands of residents.
Since the war began on October 7, Israeli forces have arrested more than 2,000 people  , according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group.
The Israeli military has put the figure at more than 1,000 and said most are affiliated with Hamas.
At least 174 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed across the West Bank since October 7, when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
Since then, Israel has launched an air and ground assault on Gaza that has so far killed at least 10,812 Palestinians, including more than 4,400 children. At least 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza are now internally displaced, according to UN estimates, as large swaths of the besieged territory lie in ruins.

Three young Palestinian men have been shot near a university campus in Vermont in the United States, according to media reports.
Reports said the incident took place on Saturday evening near the University of Vermont's campus in the city of Burlington.
The three were identified as Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdel Hamid and Tahseen Ahmed. They are studying at three different universities in the US.
According to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), two of the victims are in intensive care while one was due to be released on Sunday.
'[We] are deeply distressed by the recent incident involving three of our graduates,' the Ramallah Friends School in the occupied West Bank, where the three studied, said in a statement on Facebook.
'While we are relieved to know they are alive, we remain uncertain about their condition. We extend our thoughts and prayers to them and their families for a full recovery, especially considering the severity of the injuries - as Hisham has been shot in the back, Tahseen in the chest, and Kinnan with minor injuries.'
Three young Palestinian men, Hisham Awartani, Tahseen Ali and Kenan Abdulhamid, students at Brown and other US universities, were shot last night on their way to a family dinner in Burlington, USA.

The motive behind the attack is unknown. When contacted by Al Jazeera, the Burlington police did not immediately respond to a request for further information.
'Hate a motivating factor'
The ADC said it was contacted about the shooting earlier on Sunday, and that it has 'reason to believe [it] was motivated by the three victims being Arab'.
'According to the information provided, the three victims were wearing a keffiyeh and speaking Arabic. A man shouted and harassed the victims, then proceeded to shoot them,' the group said in a  .
This morning, ADC was contacted about the shooting, after reviewing the information, we have reason to believe that the shooting was motivated by the three vitims being Arab.

'Given the information collected and provided, it is clear that hate was a motivating factor in this shooting," said ADC's Director Abed Ayoub.
"We call on law enforcement to investigate it as such. The surge in anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian sentiment we are experiencing is unprecedented, and this is another example of that hate turning violent.'
The incident came amid a   in the US, with both Republican and Democratic politicians backing Israel's  despite the mounting Palestinian death toll and growing accusations of war crimes.
Israel's ground and air assault on the besieged Gaza Strip has so far killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, and left vast swathes of the Strip in ruins.

'Not just a number': A protest and a funeral in the West Bank

Ramallah, occupied West Bank – The Qalandia checkpoint wasn't busy. There were just a few cars trying to cross into the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem.
It was November 1, and Palestinian groups had called a "day of rage" to protest Israel's relentless bombing of the Gaza Strip. The previous day, Israeli bombs had   in northern Gaza. The camp would take another hit on November 1 and then again a few days later.
In Ramallah, rubbish containers blocked some streets. Shops, restaurants and cafes were closed while street vendors were selling bananas to protesters. A large banner in Al-Manara Square read in English and Arabic, 'We are not numbers,' alongside photos of some of the more than 4,000 Palestinian children who have been killed in the bombing.
About 200 people gathered to march, most of them teenagers. Some were covering their faces, others carrying posters with graphic pictures of the children killed in Gaza.
A 38-year-old-man attended the protest with his wife and young son.'We have been relying on the   for 25 to 30 years, and things are only getting tougher,' he told Al Jazeera, expressing a sentiment that many Palestinians share about the lack of a unified and effective response from the international community to stop the attacks against Gaza.
Like many others attending the rally, he blamed the   for not doing enough to defend Palestinian interests during the war. He put his son on his shoulders and walked on.
Another protester, a 35-year-old woman from  , said she had been unable to return to her town because of the tightening of the checkpoints. But most of all, she said, she fears the settlers who have surrounded her hometown.
'Netanyahu has given thousands of weapons to the settlers. They do what they want,' she said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has personally handed out weapons to settlers in the West Bank and has said he has acquired 10,000 assault rifles to distribute.
When asked about how she thinks the war might end, the woman said: 'Palestinians need the right to their land. Palestinians need to be free.'
Some of the young protesters at the rally shouted slogans threatening violence against Israel. A slim, bespectacled man in his 70s who was passing by muttered: 'They are radicalizing.' He said he disapproves of violence as a means of resistance.
A day after the protest near Yasser Arafat's mausoleum in Ramallah, a 29-year-old man with bright green eyes and a defiant stare was working in a coffee shop while chatting with some patrons. Palestinian Authority officials, he said, 'just sit on their chairs and do nothing'.
'They [  ] are armed. We are not. Where is the resistance?' he asked. He pulled out his mobile phone to show videos of the body of a Palestinian teenager killed that day.
On the morning of November 2, the Israeli military raided the town of Qalqilya near Ramallah, killing two Palestinians. One of them was 14-year-old Ayhem Mahmud al-Shafi.
Since October 7, at least 183 Palestinians, including 44 children, have died in the West Bank in attacks by Israeli forces or settlers. More than 11,200 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip, and about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's attacks on southern Israel on October 7.
Ayham's body was carried through the streets of Ramallah by hundreds of mourners. Shopkeepers closed their businesses as the mourners passed through the streets, chanting revolutionary songs about martyrs and the liberation of Palestine.
Some of the mourners urged onlookers to join the procession. On the sidewalks, a few women were crying. Others recorded the procession with their mobile phones.
As the body passed through Al-Amara Square, the procession stopped for a moment: Ayhem's father, mother, uncle and a neighbour kissed him goodbye. To them, and to hundreds of mourners, Ayhem was not a number.

October 7th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel and Hamas seem to be on the brink of another conflict after a surprise attack on Saturday involving aerial, sea and ground operations, initiated by the Palestinian group from the Gaza Strip. Israel responded with a heavy bombardment of the blockaded coastal enclave.
Here is what to know:
What happened and when?
The Palestinian armed group Hamas   against Israel in the most serious escalation since Israel and Hamas fought an 11-day war in 2021.
Hamas said it had fired 5,000 rockets, while Israel confirmed that the group's fighters had entered its territory.
Daniel Hagari, an Israeli army spokesman, said that the group attacked from land, sea and air.
The   at 06:30am local time (03:30 GMT).
The Israeli army also said it launched 'Operation Iron Swords' against the Hamas group in the Gaza Strip.
The early-morning strikes occurred on Simchat Torah, a holiday which falls towards the conclusion of the weeklong Jewish festival known as Sukkot, or the Feast of Tabernacles.
Where did the attacks take place?
The rockets were fired as far north as Tel Aviv. Hamas also sent fighters into southern Israel.
Israeli media said that gunmen had opened fire on passers-by in the town of Sderot, and footage circulating on social media appeared to show clashes in city streets as well as gunmen in jeeps roaming the countryside. One report claimed Hamas fighters had taken control of multiple Israeli civilian population centres, where residents were begging for help from their government.
The Israeli army says dozens of fighter jets were carrying out attacks on Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip.
Currently, the gun battles are taking place in and around the towns of Kfar Aza, Sderot, Sufa, Nahal Oz, Magen, Be'eri, and the Re'im military base, the Times of Israel reported.

How many casualties in Israel and Palestine?
At least 22 Israelis have been killed, local media said, quoting emergency services. More than 500 Israelis have been injured, Reuters quoted the country's health ministry as saying.
At least four Palestinians have been killed and five are wounded in confrontations between the Israeli army and Palestinian groups in the border area of the Gaza Strip, Anadolu news agency said.
(Al Jazeera)
Why did Hamas attack Israel?
Hamas   has told Al Jazeera that the group's military operation is in response to all the atrocities the Palestinians have faced over the decades.
'We want the international community to stop atrocities in Gaza, against Palestinian people, our holy sites like Al-Aqsa. All these things are the reason behind starting this battle,' he said.
"This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth," Mohammed Deif, the Hamas military commander said, adding that 5,000 rockets were launched.
'Everyone who has a gun should take it out. The time has come,' Deif said, according to reports.
Hamas called on "the resistance fighters in the West Bank" as well as "our Arab and Islamic nations" to join the battle, in a statement posted on Telegram.
What is the Israeli government saying?
The Israeli army warned Israelis who live near Gaza to stay in their homes or head to shelters.
"In the last hour, the Hamas terrorist organisation had begun a massive shooting of rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory, and terrorists infiltrated into Israeli territory in a number of different locations,' the army said. 'The Hamas terrorist organisation is the sovereign in the Gaza Strip and is responsible for this attack. It will face the consequences and responsibility for these events,' it added.

What are the international reactions so far?
The Czech government has condemned Hamas for launching 'terrorist attacks' on Prague's traditional ally Israel.
The European Union's foreign chief, Josep Borrell, expressed solidarity with Israel.
The French foreign ministry said France condemned the "terrorist attacks under way against Israel and its population" and that France expressed its full solidarity with Israel.
The UK "unequivocally condemns" a surprise attack by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas on Israel on Saturday, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said.
Egypt warned of "grave consequences" from an escalation in a statement from the foreign ministry carried by the state news agency on Saturday. It called for "exercising maximum restraint and avoiding exposing civilians to further danger".
Lebanese group Hezbollah issued a statement on Saturday saying it was closely following the situation in Gaza and was in "direct contact with the leadership of the Palestinian resistance".

Jordan cancels Biden summit after hundreds killed in Gaza hospital blast

Jordan has cancelled a summit it was scheduled to host in Amman on Wednesday with United States President Joe Biden and the Egyptian and Palestinian leaders to discuss Gaza, Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has said.
Safadi said the meeting would be held at a time when the parties could agree to end the "war and the massacres against Palestinians", blaming Israel with its military campaign for pushing the region to "the brink of the abyss".
Biden was expected to make a whirlwind trip to Israel where he would later head to Jordan and, according to Jordanian officials, meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el Sisi and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
The US president now will visit only Israel and postpone his travel to Jordan, a White House official said as Biden departed on Tuesday.
Jordan's King Abdullah would have hosted the four-way summit, which would have on its agenda the need to get humanitarian assistance to Gaza to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and tamper the conflict with Israel.
Abdullah has blamed Israel for a   that killed about 500 Palestinians on Tuesday, saying it was a "shame on humanity" and called on Israel to immediately end its military assault on Gaza.
Palestinian officials say the explosion was caused by an Israeli air raid. Israeli officials have said the blast was caused when a rocket launched by a Palestinian armed group misfired. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the claims.
King Abdullah warned that Israel's response following a deadly cross-border attack by Hamas on October 7 that killed and injured more than 1,000 Israelis went beyond the right of self-defence to collective punishment of Palestinian civilians.
The cancellation reflects an increasingly volatile situation that will test the limits of US influence in the region as Biden visits Israel on Wednesday.
Failure to meet with Abbas or any Palestinian official, while meeting Israelis on their soil, could undermine Biden's diplomatic message and draw criticism at home and abroad.
After the hospital blast, Biden's efforts in the Israel-Hamas war were criticised by US Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress.
Tlaib, a Democrat who had previously been muted in her criticism of Biden's policy, said in a post on social media platform X, "This is what happens when you refuse to facilitate a ceasefire & help de-escalate. Your war and destruction only approach has opened my eyes and many Palestinian Americans and Muslims Americans like me."
More than 70 religious and activist groups, led by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest US Muslim civil rights group, called on Biden to demand a ceasefire in Gaza during his visit.

Why is France's Macron visiting Israel?

October 24th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
French President Emmanuel Macron is the latest Western leader to visit Israel. Here is what you need to know about his trip:
What time and where did he arrive?
Macron landed at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport at 04:30 GMT on Tuesday.
Macron's visit comes more than two weeks after Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, including about 30 French citizens.
What is the purpose of his visit?
Macron was due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express France's "full solidarity" with Israel, the French presidency said. This is in the wake of the recent violence following the   of October 7.
Additionally, Macron is expected to address the "preservation of the civilian population" in  , amid Israel's relentless bombardment, and as it prepares for a   of the Palestinian enclave.
Macron will call for a "humanitarian truce" to allow desperately needed   into Gaza, whose 2.3 million people have been largely deprived of water, food, electricity and other basic supplies after an  , the Elysee Palace said.
Macron will propose relaunching a "true peace process", with the aim of creating a viable Palestinian state in exchange for guarantees from regional powers towards "Israel's security".
Who else will he meet with during his visit?
Soon after he landed, Macron visited Israeli-French nationals whose family members have died in the violence. He also met with the families of captives.
Macron is scheduled to meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog at 06:20 GMT.
He plans to also meet opposition leaders   and   in Jerusalem before holding a joint press conference withNetanyahu at 10:00 GMT.
There will also probably be exchanges with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, King Abdullah II of Jordan, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and leaders of Gulf nations, the Elysee said.
What is France's position so far on this conflict?
France has favoured a   solution and the country advocates for 'Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security, within secure, internationally recognized borders,' as stated by a delegate in the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 2012.
It also believes that Jerusalem should be the capital of both states, according to the France Diplomacy website.
French author and expert in the Israel-Palestine conflict,   told Al Jazeera that France condemned Israeli aggression in 1967 and continued with this policy while recognising the state of Palestine. France, at the time, took the initiative on this issue among countries in Europe and its efforts culminated in the Venice Declaration, which called for negotiation with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). This was when the United States still considered the PLO a "terrorist" organisation.
However, in recent years, while France claims that its position hasn't changed, "its stance has indeed changed, as it is now developing bilateral relationships with Israel, as if Palestine doesn't exist," said Gresh.
The French government has increasingly opposed the Palestinian cause, even trying to criminalise the   movement, Gresh added.
What is France's relationship with Israel/Palestine?
France recognised Israel and established diplomatic ties in 1949, only a year after its establishment. France supports Israel and its sovereignty, according to the France Diplomacy website.
After the Hamas attack, Macron expressed Paris's full support for Israel's right to defend itself as the Eiffel Tower  in the colours of the Israeli flag.
In 1982, former French President Francois Mitterrand expressed the goal of creating a Palestinian state before the Israeli parliament. France raised the status of the General Delegation of Palestine in France to the Mission of Palestine in 2010. France voted in favour of Palestine becoming a non-member observer state of the United Nations in 2012.
Why are people protesting in France?
Thousands of people demonstrated on Sunday in the Place de la Republique in a pro-Palestine protest as the death toll from Israeli air raids in Gaza rose to nearly  .
This was the first protest authorised by the French police among the recent pro-Palestinian protests in different French cities.
During previous pro-Palestine protests, the French police   on protesters, using tear gas and water cannon to disperse them. This was after Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin ordered a ban on all pro-Palestine demonstrations in the name of 'public order'.

Ramallah, occupied West Bank – Israeli special forces have chased and killed a 15-year-old Palestinian boy who saw them sneaking into Jenin refugee camp during a military raid in the northern occupied West Bank, documentation by a leading human rights group shows.
The Palestine chapter of Geneva-based Defense for Children International (DCIP) said in a report  on Wednesday that Rafat Omar Ahmad Khamayseh was killed on Tuesday as he was leaving his grandfather's house in the Jenin refugee camp.
"As he left the house, Rafat saw Israeli special forces exiting three Palestinian licensed cars and surround the home of the father of a Palestinian man wanted for arrest. Rafat fled, yelling, 'Special forces! Special forces!' One Israeli soldier chased Rafat and shot him in the abdomen from a distance of 10 meters [33 feet]," DCIP said.
The Israeli forces shot at Rafat again when a Palestinian man came to his aid, said the group, the only rights organisation specifically focused on children in Palestine.
"The Palestinian man threw himself on top of Rafat and rolled him toward his house, less than five meters [16 feet] away. The man and his family sheltered Rafat for about an hour and a half as the Israeli military prevented ambulances from accessing Jenin refugee camp. Rafat died before an ambulance transferred him to Ibn Sina Hospital in Jenin."
DCIP explained that the boy "was struck with one bullet that entered his abdomen and exited from the upper right side of his chest. … He bled extensively from his mouth and nose while waiting for an ambulance."
According to  local media, an initial medical report issued by Ibn Sina Specialized Hospital in Jenin said: 'Khamayseh arrived at the hospital unconscious and without any signs of life."
"Investigations and evidence collected by DCIP regularly suggest that Israeli forces use lethal force against Palestinian children in circumstances that may amount to extrajudicial or willful killings," DCIP said.
Israeli forces have killed at least 240 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and besieged Gaza Strip since the start of 2023, including 46 children.
The figure includes   on Tuesday in Jenin, Jericho and Gaza in the latest daily Israeli military raids  in the occupied Palestinian territory.
International and local rights groups have declared 2023 the "deadliest" year for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since 2005.
Israel  , arrests and killings in Palestinian cities and villages in the occupied West Bank from June 2021 following a   known as the 'May outburst', which swept Israel and the Palestinian territory it has illegally occupied for the past 56 years.
While the state of armed resistance in the occupied West Bank was largely dismantled by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Israel following the end of the second Intifada (uprising) in 2005, the city of Jenin and its refugee camp re-emerged in 2021 as  , with other cities and camps particularly in the north of the occupied West Bank following suit.
Uninvolved bystanders have been killed, along with civilians trying to defend their neighbourhoods, by the Israeli army during raids. Palestinian resistance fighters are killed in targeted assassinations as well as  .

At least 11 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry, amid protests against the continuing Israeli bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip.
Protests took place in cities across the Israeli-occupied territory on Friday, including Ramallah, Tulkarem, Nablus and Hebron, hours after Israel ordered residents in northern Gaza to evacuate their homes ahead of an expected ground invasion.
The AFP news agency reported that at least three people were killed in the town of Tulkarem, and a 14-year-old boy was killed in Beit Furik, near Nablus. The news outlet dpa reported that Israeli settlers, alongside soldiers, took part in some confrontations with Palestinian protesters.
At least 46 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank since Saturday, according to the health ministry.
The killings come amid rising tensions in the occupied West Bank, as Israel carries out a crushing   on Gaza ahead of an expected ground assault against the Palestinian group Hamas, which governs Gaza. Hamas fighters carried out a   in southern Israel on Saturday that killed at least 1,300 people.
In neighbouring Jordan, riot police dispersed a pro-Palestinian rally as it tried to march towards the border with the occupied West Bank, which Israeli authorities have placed under  .
Jordan and Egypt have expressed concern that further escalation could have a destabilising effect within their own countries and across the region.
Cairo on Friday rejected Israel's demand for more than one million residents of northern Gaza to  , amid fears of a massive influx of refugees across the heavily fortified border into its territory.
Egypt's Foreign Ministry said the move "constitutes a grave violation of the rules of international humanitarian law, and will expose the lives of more than a million Palestinian citizens and their families to the dangers of remaining in the open without shelter."
In the statement, Egypt called on the United Nations Security Council, which is scheduled to meet Friday, to stop the evacuation
The United Nations has said that such a large-scale evacuation, carried out under constant  , is 'impossible', would have "devastating humanitarian consequences" and has called on the order to be rescinded.
The Norwegian Refugee Council, a rights group, warned that the demand, "absent of any guarantees of safety or return, would amount to the war crime of forcible transfer".
In the occupied West Bank, settler violence has also intensified since Saturday.
Israel's far-right National Security Minister   announced earlier this week that his ministry was purchasing 10,000 assault rifles for distribution to Israelis, including those living in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.

On Thursday, a Palestinian man and his son were shot and killed when settlers   on a funeral taking place for several Palestinians killed in a separate settler attack the previous day.

Alain Gresh: 'Macron's party has a strong anti-Palestinian position'

October 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Paris, France – After the Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, French President Emmanuel Macron was quick to join his European counterparts in condemning the violence.
He expressed Paris's full support for Israel's right to defend itself as the Eiffel Tower   in the colours of the Israeli flag.
The Hamas assault set off a major new conflict, with Israel now promising a ground invasion of Gaza to crush the Palestinian group which rules the besieged strip. More than 3,000 Palestinians have been killed, as well as at least 1,400 in Israel, in less than two weeks.
France   in support of Palestine on October 12 and police have fired on the demonstrators who defied the order with tear gas and water cannon.
Macron's response has been compared with that of Charles de Gaulle, the first president of the fifth and current French republic.
Although France was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in 1949, this did not prevent de Gaulle from condemning Israel at the start of the Six-Day War between Israel and a coalition of Arab states in June 1967, a position that differed from many world leaders at the time and which was met with accusations of anti-Semitism.
Al Jazeera spoke with French journalist Alain Gresh, who has written several books on the Middle East conflict. Gresh is also the founder of Orient XXI, a digital magazine which analyses developments in the Arab and Muslim worlds.
Al Jazeera: How has France's position on the Israel-Palestine conflict evolved over the years?
Alain Gresh: Charles de Gaulle paved the way when he condemned Israeli aggression in 1967 and the presidents that came after him more or less continued with this policy, despite being from different political parties.
The policy consisted of not only condemning Israeli aggression but also of saying that recognising the state of Palestine was part of the solution [to bringing peace to this region]. France at the time led the charge on this issue in Europe and its efforts culminated in the Venice Declaration [an agreement issued by the nine members of the European Economic Community – the precursor to the European Union].
Al Jazeera: What did that declaration say?
Gresh: It stated that there would be no solution [to the Israel-Palestine conflict] unless all states in the region, including Israel, were recognised, negotiation talks were held with the PLO [Palestinian Liberation Organization, a Palestinian group that is now recognised as the official representative of the Palestinian Authority] and that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people were recognised, including the right to self-government.
At that time, the US still considered the PLO to be a terrorist organisation. In fact, President Nixon even said something along the lines that Europe wanted [the US] to negotiate with "Arab Nazis". Israel's current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made the same comparison with Hamas.
France at that time recognised that there would be no solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict unless the Palestinians were included and its relationship with Israel was thus dependent on the situation in the Palestinian territories.
Al Jazeera: And how has France's position changed since then?
Gresh: In the years since Presidents Nicolas Sarkozy, Francois Hollande and now Emmanuel Macron, France has said that it hasn't changed its position on the Israel-Palestine conflict, saying that they still want a two-state solution and condemning expanding Israeli settlements.
However, the problem is that its stance has indeed changed, as it is now developing bilateral relationships with Israel, as if Palestine doesn't exist.
They are not putting any real pressure on Israel, and the relationship between Israel and France on matters such as security has never been so good. This shift was not a one-day decision and many factors contributed to it.
For instance, [terrorism] has played an important role. After 9/11 in the US, France started saying that, "We are in a war against terror" and that the Israelis are "fighting terror and Islamists just like us".
Presenting Islamism as a threat to European security and identity has played an important role in changing France's position [on the Israel-Palestine conflict] and that of other European countries across the political spectrum.
From 1967 onwards, de Gaulle wanted to develop relationships with the Arab world and part of this meant having a strong position on Palestine. Now, you can have good relations with the 'official' Arab world even if you are 100 percent pro-Israeli. It has become easier to have this position now that part of the Arab world has   with Israel.
Al Jazeera: France, which is home to Europe's largest Muslim minority, a community the state often has tensions with, recently made headlines by banning pro-Palestinian protests. Paris said that they are 'likely to generate disturbances to the public order'. What's behind this order, and how does it conflict with France's commitment to free speech?
Gresh: It was different at the beginning of Macron's presidency. They [the French government] have attacked the Palestinian cause more and more. They tried to criminalise the   [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions] movement, which went to the European court to say that their movement should be allowed to continue because of the right to freedom of speech [the European court subsequently ruled in their favour].
It's clear that the French government feels that what is happening in Gaza has brought this debate to a whole new level.
[Banning pro-Palestine protests] is hypocrisy. It is very strange in a country where we defended Charlie Hebdo, which published cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad, and that in the aftermath of the 2015 terrorist attacks, we said that we can say whatever we want in the name of freedom of speech.
They [the French government] are condemning BDS, which is not a violent movement and trying to put pressure on people so that they can't express solidarity with Palestine. It's a risky position in my opinion as it widens the gap between France and the Arab world. France is … seen as having become worse because of its  , the hijab.
Distancing itself from its Muslim population and not allowing it to express support for Palestine may push people to do crazy things. If you can't express your support using political means, some people will want to express it in a violent way, and I think that is very dangerous.
Al Jazeera: Other than Macron's centrist party, where do the others stand?
Gresh: If we examine France's different political parties, it's clear Macron's party has a very strong anti-Palestinian position, even though they say that they support the two-state solution.
Even left-wing parties in France have been reluctant to take on the Palestinian cause, except for Jean-Luc Melenchon's [far-left] La France Insoumise [France Unbowed] party and grassroots organisations.
There's also somewhat of an internal political struggle happening in France, as Melenchon's party has refused to describe Hamas as a terrorist organisation [following the October 7 attack].
I think some of the political forces in France want to get rid of Melenchon, like they did with   in the UK. They are simply trying to use what has been happening in Gaza to attack him. It has nothing to do with the Palestinian cause.
Al Jazeera: Upon Russia's invasion of Ukraine, France, along with other European countries, said that Ukraine had a right to defend itself. However, following Hamas's attack on Israel, it showed support for Israel while making no acknowledgement of Israel's continued occupation of Palestine. Why the double standards in your view?
Gresh: There is no logic to it. We have condemned Russia for starving a population and cutting off water and electricity, but now we are supporting Israel as they do the same thing.
Al Jazeera: Considering France's own history with anti-Semitism, most notably with the mass deportation of Jews during World War II, how has this shaped French policy towards the Israel-Palestine conflict?
Gresh: Of course it has shaped French policy, but if anything anti-Semitism was much more of a problem back in 1967 than it is today. I think it is merely a pretext. Of course, there are still problems with anti-Semitism today, we must acknowledge that much of it is coming from [France's far-right] National Rally party. Marine Le Pen [leader of the National Rally] says that she supports Israel today, but like many extreme right groups now, we can only say that they are more anti-Islamic than anti-Semitic.
Israel doesn't really care about anti-Semitism, they merely weaponise it. You can see that when they forge relations with far-right parties in Eastern Europe that they don't have a problem with anti-Semitism then, as they're trying to make a front of all people who support Israel. However, it is worth noting that most of the big far-right parties are more anti-Islam than anti-Semitic now.
Al Jazeera: Many among France's sizeable Jewish population hold strong ties with Israel. Could tensions between communities in France emerge?
Gresh: It's been an issue since 1967. I remember the French government was concerned back then about potential clashes between Jews and Muslims in France. After the Algerian War, much of the country's Jewish population came to France after independence.
We now have a population of five million Muslims and 500,000 Jews [the largest in Europe for both groups]. It's normal that the government has some concerns, but if you have concerns, then you must ban demonstrations in support of both Israel and Palestine, not just one or the other.
Al Jazeera: In your view, how should France be approaching the latest Middle East conflict?
Gresh: I want the French government to return to when it had a voice independent of the US and Israel. In the 1980s, it pushed for the PLO to be recognised, which led to talks between the PLO and Israel. We must have a political process.
Regarding the situation in Gaza, the problem is that the people living there are willing to do anything to get out of it.
Following the Munich 1972 Olympic Games [during which members of the PLO invaded the Olympic Village and killed two members of the Israeli team], what led to the PLO renouncing this type of activity was the possibility of a political solution.
Now the Palestinians don't have any possible political solution. France should help create the political solution. Violence is not the solution, so France should step up and help create it [the political solution], though I fear they do not want to.

Israeli air raid kills Palestinian journalist and family in Gaza

November 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
An Israeli air raid has killed a journalist working for the Palestinian Authority's television channel, as well as 10 family members, according to the network.
Palestine TV accused Israel of carrying out a "deliberate assassination" of Mohammed Abu Hatab as it bombed his family home in Gaza's Khan Younis, in the south of the territory, on Thursday.
"Our colleague Mohammed Abu Hatab fell as a martyr along with members of his family in an Israeli bombardment against his home in Khan Younis," the TV station said in a statement carried by the Palestinian news agency Wafa.
Sources at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis said at least 11 people were killed in the strike.
The statement said an air strike hit Abu Hatab's apartment shortly after his arrival.
It asserted that the attack 'is a bloody message to terrorise Palestinian journalists,' intended to stop them from 'conveying the suffering of the Palestinian people and exposing the crimes of the occupation'.
The channel said it would continue to carry out its duty 'no matter how great the sacrifices are and no matter how many crimes the occupying state commits against our journalists'.
Dozens of journalists killed
The Palestinian journalists' union says that 27 of its members have been killed in Gaza since October 7.
Local and international media representatives in Gaza used to work from offices in Gaza City. However, intense Israeli bombardments, which destroyed many buildings, have forced news organisations to send their teams to the south of the enclave, even as Israeli air strikes hit targets across the entire territory.
The conflict raged for a 28th day on Friday after the October 7 attacks when Hamas fighters stormed the border, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 people as captives, Israeli officials say.
Since then, Israel has relentlessly pounded the Palestinian territory and sent in ground troops, with Gaza's health ministry saying 9,061 people have been killed, including 3,760 children.

Gaza faces humanitarian catastrophe as Israel evacuates north

October 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Ramallah, occupied West Bank – Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip are facing a "real catastrophe", United Nations officials warn, as Israel's heaviest bombardment of the occupied enclave rages on for the 11th consecutive day.
In a report on Tuesday, the UN said the Israeli army continued pounding southern areas despite previously telling residents to move south ahead of a looming offensive by land, air and sea on the tiny coastal strip of land.
It also stressed that "water remains a key issue as people will start dying without water", a warning that came hours after the World Health Organization said there are only '24 hours of water, electricity and fuel left' in Gaza.
Residents of the besieged Strip, home to more than two million Palestinians, have already been severely struggling with little to no water to drink, shower or do laundry. They are also facing grave shortages of basic supplies including baby formula and flour, with all supermarkets out of stock.
"Concerns over dehydration and waterborne diseases are high given the collapse of water and sanitation services, including today's shutdown of Gaza's last functioning seawater desalination plant," the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said in Tuesday's report. "Fuel reserves at all hospitals across Gaza are expected to last for an additional 24 hours only. The shutdown of backup generators would place the lives of thousands of patients at serious risk."
More than 2,800 people, including at least 1,000 children, have been killed in Israel's bombing campaign since October 7, according to Palestinian officials. Some 10,000 others have been wounded, with many remaining buried under the rubble.
The bombardment began after fighters from Hamas, the Palestinian armed resistance movement running the Strip, launched a surprise attack just outside the besieged enclave on Israeli territory. So far, at least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed and more than 4,000 injured, according to Israeli officials.
In the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, Israel has killed 61 Palestinians over the past 11 days in military raids and arrests in Palestinian neighbourhoods, towns and villages, the Palestinian health ministry said on Tuesday morning. At least seven of those were killed by settlers.
The latest deadly raid took place at dawn on Tuesday when the Israeli army killed 17-year-old Mohammad Melhem in a raid on the town of Halhul in Hebron in the southern occupied West Bank.
In Nablus, the health ministry also announced on Tuesday the death of 72-year-old Sameer Sabra after he sustained an Israeli army gunshot wound on Friday.
Meanwhile, Israel announced on Monday night that it would begin evacuating residents of 28 mostly Jewish-only communities located about 2km away from its northern border with Lebanon as tensions and exchanges of fire with the Hezbollah armed group continue, threatening a wider, more regional war.
The evacuation will be carried out by the Israeli army and those evacuated will be accommodated in hotels and guest houses paid for by the Israeli government.
Arrests and captives
In a video statement on Monday, Abu Obaida, spokesperson for Hamas's armed wing, said the group was holding up to 250 captives in the besieged Strip. He noted that 22 captives have so far lost their lives in Israeli bombardment.
The group also said it was holding a number of non-Israeli captives that they were prepared to release when "on-the-ground circumstances permit it."
Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal indicated  on Monday that the captives were being held in hopes of releasing the roughly 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons. He told Al Araby TV that Hamas "has what it needs to empty the prisons of all prisoners".
In 2011, Israel released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for one Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, who was held captive in Gaza for five years.
Late on Monday, Hamas released a recorded video statement from one of the captives, a 21-year-old French-Israeli citizen who identified herself as Mia Schem and pleaded to be returned to her family.
Separately on Monday night, Israeli police arrested Nazareth-based Palestinian singer and cultural icon Dalal Abu Amneh, who holds Israeli citizenship, over a Facebook post in support of Gaza. An Israeli court ruled to extend her detention on Tuesday morning.
The Palestinian Authority Commission for Detainees Affairs said on Tuesday that Israel has arrested 680 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7, adding that 25 percent of those arrested were children and elderly men.
At least 88 people were arrested overnight on Tuesday.
On October 13, Israel amended its military orders in the occupied territories to make it easier for soldiers to arrest Palestinians on mere suspicion under the Unlawful Combatants law.

Here is the situation on Wednesday,  , 2023:
Latest developments
Late on Tuesday, the United States House of Representatives   Congress's only Palestinian-American member, Rashida Tlaib, over her criticism of Israeli bombardment of Gaza and   for Israel.
A vigil was held outside Knesset, the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem, on Tuesday night to mark one month since more than 1,400 people were killed in Israel by Hamas and another 240 were taken captive.
The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project has recorded 4,200 demonstrations over the Israel-Palestine war   between October 7 and 27. The highest number of these protests were held in the United States and 90 percent of the global protests were in support of Palestine, the organisation reported on Tuesday. More than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed in one month of Israeli military assault.
At least 320 foreign passport holders   through the Rafah crossing to Egypt on Tuesday.
In a televised conference on Tuesday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the military is operating deep within Gaza City and "tightening the noose".
Human impact and fighting
Israeli forces launched deadly air raids   in the past 24 hours, hitting the vicinity of   and Indonesian hospitals, as well as Khan Younis, Nuseirat, and Jabalia refugee camps, according to reports from Al Jazeera Arabic and Palestinian news agency Wafa.
All bakeries in the north of Gaza have now   due to 'lack of fuel, water and wheat flour' as well as damage from air raids, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Only nine bakeries in the south of Gaza are "intermittently" available, OCHA said on Tuesday.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said its convoy of five trucks and two   vehicles was hit by gunfire while carrying supplies to health facilities on Tuesday. Two trucks were damaged and a driver slightly wounded before the convoy re-routed to al-Shifa Hospital where it delivered the supplies.
On Wednesday morning, Israel's military said one soldier was killed and two wounded during overnight fighting in northern Gaza.
Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israeli warplanes attacked   infrastructure on Tuesday in response to firing from Lebanese territory. There are fears of escalation on the Israel-Lebanon border.
Diplomacy
G7 foreign ministers held an   in the Japanese capital, Tokyo, on Tuesday evening where Gaza dominated discussions, according to Al Jazeera correspondent Katrina Yu. A joint statement is expected at the end of their two-day meeting on Wednesday.
Saudi Arabia will host summits with Islamic and African nations over the coming days to discuss Israel's war on Gaza, Reuters news agency reported.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk began a five-day Middle East visit on Tuesday to engage with officials on human rights violations in the war, according to Reuters.
Attacks and arrests in the West Bank
At least 154 Palestinians have been killed and 2,150 arrested by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war broke out a month ago, according to the Palestinian Prisoner's Society.
Predawn Israeli raids continued across   on Wednesday. Several Palestinians, including two senior journalists, have been arrested from Hebron, Al Jazeera correspondent Zein Basravi, reporting from Ramallah, said on Wednesday morning.

At least nine Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the  , according to the Palestinian health ministry, as violence soars amid Israel's continuing assault on the besieged Gaza Strip.
At least 75 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or settlers in the West Bank since the Gaza war erupted on October 7, according to ministry figures.
The Palestinian health ministry said Israeli forces killed seven Palestinian during raids on the Nur Al Shams refugee camp in the town of Tulkarem on Thursday.
Health officials said one of the victims was a 16-year-old boy.
The Israeli military said in a statement that it was "continuing to operate in the [Nur Al Shams] camp to thwart terror activity".
The Palestinian Red Crescent said its medics treated 25 people in Nur Shams, the majority for gunshot wounds.
"Ambulances are being detained by occupying forces with injured people inside," the organisation said in a statement.
Two other Palestinians were killed in separate incidents in the Dheisheh refugee camp and the town of Budrus, the ministry said.
Israeli forces have escalated raids on   and carried out a sweeping campaign of arrests in the occupied West Bank,   in solidarity with Gaza.
Israel began its assault on Gaza after the Palestinian group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, launched a   on southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 200 others captive.
Israel has since imposed a "  " on Gaza, cutting off access to water, food, electricity and fuel for the strip's 2.3 million inhabitants and relentlessly bombarding the territory. At least 3,785 people have been killed in the assault, according to Palestinian health authorities.
Protests across the West Bank — which grew more intense following reports of an explosion at   in Gaza that Palestinian authorities say killed hundreds of people on Tuesday — have also targeted the Palestinian Authority (PA), which has long faced criticism for its policy of security coordination with Israel.
PA security forces used tear gas and stun grenades to   who chanted for the ouster of President Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday.
Israeli authorities in the occupied West Bank have arrested more than 600 people since the fighting began. Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem have also warned about increasing harassment by Israeli settlers and security forces.

Egypt says Israel seeks to empty Gaza, rejects corridors for civilians

Egypt has discussed plans with the United States and others to provide humanitarian aid through its border with the Gaza Strip but rejects any move to set up safe corridors for refugees fleeing the enclave, according to Egyptian security sources.
Gaza, a coastal strip of land wedged between Israel in the north and east and Egypt to the southwest, is home to about 2.3 million people who have been living under a blockade since Palestinian armed group Hamas took control there in 2007.
Egypt has long restricted the flow of Gaza Palestinians onto its territory, even during the fiercest conflicts.
Cairo, a frequent mediator between Israel and the Palestinians, always insists the two sides resolve conflicts within their borders, saying this is the only way Palestinians can secure their right to statehood.
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the US had been holding consultations with Israel and Egypt about the idea of a safe passage for civilians from Gaza, which was hit by a massive Israeli assault in response to a deadly incursion by Hamas fighters into Israel.
Those consultations were continuing, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday.
One of the Egyptian security sources, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters news agency that Egypt rejected the idea of safe corridors for civilians to protect "the right of Palestinians to hold on to their cause and their land".
Right to return
Several Arab states still have camps for Palestinian refugees who are descendants of those who fled or left their homes during the war surrounding Israel's 1948 creation.
The Palestinians and other Arab states have said a final peace deal needs to include the right of those refugees to return, a move Israel has always rejected.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday that crucial life-saving supplies, including fuel, food and water, must be allowed into Gaza.
"We need rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access now," he told reporters, thanking Egypt "for its constructive engagement to facilitate humanitarian access through the Rafah crossing and to make the El Arish airport available for critical assistance".
UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric later said: "Civilians need to be protected. We do not want to see a mass exodus of Gazans."
Egypt has been intensifying its efforts to contain the situation in Gaza, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi told Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani during a meeting in Cairo, a statement from el-Sisi's office said.
According to the Egyptian security sources, talks between Egypt and the US, Qatar and Turkey discussed the idea of delivering humanitarian aid through the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula under a geographically limited ceasefire.
Turkey's president said work had started to deliver aid, without elaborating.
The Rafah crossing, which is the main exit point from Gaza not controlled by Israel, has been closed since Tuesday after Israeli bombardments hit on the Palestinian side, according to officials in Gaza and Egyptian sources.
Egypt has made repeated statements this week warning against the possibility that Israel's assault on Gaza could lead to the displacement of residents from the enclave onto Egyptian territory.
Israel's ambassador in Egypt, Amira Oron, said in a post on social media that Israel had "no intentions in relation to Sinai, and has not asked Palestinians to move there … Sinai is Egyptian territory".
Asked about the prospect of displacement following a meeting with Tajani, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said: "Egypt was keen to open the Rafah crossing to provide humanitarian aid, food and medicine, but instability and the expansion of the conflict leads to more hardship and more refugees to safe areas, including Europe."

Atop a Jerusalem mountain, a cafe of rare coexistence in a divided city

Jerusalem – Aroma Espresso Bar, a trendy cafe, straddled between the Hebrew University campus and a sprawling hospital complex and perched 834 metres above sea level, is usually a hub of activity.
Hospital staff, professors, lecturers, and local and international students often mingle as they grab a quick snack or coffee.
For 20 years, the cafe has offered a unique atmosphere in a deeply divided city, a haven where Palestinian and Israeli medical staff and students could coexist.
Rania Abu al-Hawa, a soft-spoken maths lecturer, says it is a place where everyone goes to "relax, regardless of where they are from".
Rania Abu al-Hawa outside Aroma Espresso Bar [Al Jazeera]
"We forget everything here; we can have no politics for an hour, then we head out and face the real world."
That was until recent events.
After Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing more than 1,400 people, Israel responded with a near-constant aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which has included the targeting of schools, hospitals and the enclave's oldest church where Palestinians were seeking shelter. More than 4,100 Palestinians have been  .
At the Aroma counter, Palestinian staff prepare coffee for customers. Ahmad*, a mild-mannered Palestinian, takes an order in Arabic, before looking up and seamlessly switching to Hebrew as a towering Israeli soldier approaches the counter.
Ahmad says he has both Palestinian and Israeli friends at work. It's normal to chit-chat every morning with each other – the cafe has been a bubble, he explains, where tensions would be put aside.
Now, Ahmad says he speaks less with the Israeli friends he had made at work. "It's risky," he says, choosing his words carefully.
There is only a trickle of customers using the cafe now compared with before. Chairs that are usually filled with students, who take pictures of fancy drinks and post them on social media, are propped up against the tables.
To be sure, many regulars at the cafe still view it as a rare space where Jerusalem's mixed population can visit.
Danny, a 44-year-old Israeli working in real estate, strides out of a nearby building, a dark pair of sunglasses shielding him from the morning light. He says he has always enjoyed the cafe because he prefers "to stay out of politics", and it is a place where "both Arabs and Jews like to go".
He says that people are focused on their jobs in the area, and there are always good relations between Palestinians and Israelis in the hospital and university.
Ahmad says the cafe can only cater to everyone due to the "special dynamic" of the area. He adds that the menu is not kosher, which means that Israelis who visit are more secular and, therefore, more "open-minded" to mixing with non-Jews.
Despite most of the staff being Palestinian, the ownership of the cafe, which is part of a chain with more than 200 stores, is Israeli, and some of the profits, he says, go towards the army.
It has left some Palestinians conflicted about working at the cafe.
"Some people asked me why are you helping to give to the army?" Ahmad says, "But it is not just us; almost every business does now, just take McDonald's, for example".
McDonald's Israel had recently announced on its social media accounts that it had handed out thousands of free meals to the Israeli military.
A view from Jerusalem's Old City [Al Jazeera]
The Aroma Espresso Bar had previously attempted to open in a Palestinian neighbourhood, but Ahmad says it had to close after being attacked.
The recent tensions have affected the work environment; staff are eager not to discuss any of the recent events.
Many Palestinians who work for Israeli companies who spoke to Al Jazeera had been warned about expressing any pro-Palestinian sentiment. Rights groups and lawyers have noted dozens of instances where Palestinian employees have been   after allegedly expressing support for Hamas.
Mount Scopus, where the cafe sits, has a Hebrew and an Arabic name: The former translates to the "Mount of the Watchmen" and the latter to "Mount Lookout". Both names are a nod to the spectacular view of the ancient city from the cafe.
In the distance, monolithic concrete walls cut off dense Palestinian neighbourhoods.
Wad Sub Laban, a shy student in her twenties, climbs up a steep pathway from Issawiya, a Palestinian neighbourhood on the rocky eastern slopes of the mountain.
She passes two large boulders that separate the area from the university car park; a couple of Israeli soldiers sit in a vehicle, eyeing everyone who comes and goes.
She likes to visit the cafe in between her classes and pick up a hot chocolate, but her view of the cafe as a haven, where both sides can coexist has been jaded, and she suggests it is more a matter of convenience.
She says that politics is not discussed only because "mostly Arabs work at the cafe, but most of the students who visit are Israelis" — so a power dynamic is at play where Palestinians know not to rock the boat.
*Names of some individuals have been changed to protect their identity

Gaza under communications blackout, amid warnings of cover for war crimes

October 28th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza continues to be unreachable to the outside world after the  , as humanitarian and media organisations warn the communications blackout could provide cover for atrocities in the besieged enclave.
Palestinians inside Gaza were unable to communicate with people outside the enclave for a second day on Saturday after some of the heaviest bombing of the war and reports by Hamas of limited ground incursions by Israeli forces overnight.
Palestinian telecoms provider Jawwal said late on Friday that Israel's bombardment of the Strip had destroyed 'all remaining international routes connecting Gaza to the outside world."
Al Jazeera's Nida Ibrahim, reporting from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, said on Saturday that there was 'very, very minimal' information coming out of the enclave.
'After Gaza went into darkness with no communications, no phones, no internet connections, Palestinians here outside of Gaza and elsewhere feel that they are also being kept in the dark about what's going on,' Ibrahim said.
'They can't check on their friends, on their loved ones [and] family members to check if they're alive or not.'
Amnesty International said it had lost contact with its colleagues in Gaza and the lack of communications was making it increasingly challenging to document rights abuses.
'This communications blackout means that it will be even more difficult to obtain critical information and evidence about human rights violations and war crimes being committed against Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and to hear directly from those experiencing the violations,' Erika Guevara Rosas, senior director of research, advocacy, policy and campaigns, said in a statement on Friday.
Deborah Brown, the senior technology and human rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the blackout risked 'providing cover for mass atrocities and contributing to impunity for human rights violations'.
The Committee to Protect Journalists also warned that the 'news blackout' could lead to 'serious consequences', including the spread of misinformation.
The collapse of communications services in Gaza came as Israel ramped up its bombardment ahead of an expected full-scale ground offensive on the enclave.
On Friday, Al Jazeera's Safwat Kahlout, reporting from Gaza City, said the latest Israeli strikes had been far greater in intensity compared with previous attacks.
'Today is the worst in terms of the strength of the Israeli fire, and we can hear some explosions coming from the sea as well, specifically in the north of the Gaza Strip,' Kahlout said.
Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Khan Younis in Gaza, said on Friday that residents were 'terrified and afraid' after being left 'totally isolated'.
Israel has launched countless air strikes on Gaza in response to Hamas's October 7 attacks inside the country, which Israeli officials say killed 1,405 people, mostly civilians.
At least 7,326 Palestinians, including more than 3,000 children, have been killed in Israeli air strikes, according to Palestinian officials.

Analysis: Why is so much anti-Palestinian disinformation coming from India?

October 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The cliche goes that the first casualty of war is truth.
With Israel's occupation of Palestine, disinformation often comes with a side of anti-Palestinianism and Islamophobia, turbocharged by social media amplification, especially under Elon Musk's leadership of X, formerly known as Twitter.
But an intriguing element of the disinformation that has flooded social media since Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel is that a lot of it has beenproduced or spread by right-leaning accounts based out of India.
Some of these fake stories include Hamas kidnapping  a Jewish baby and beheading a young  boy on the back of a truck. Blue check accounts have pushed false reports into the stratosphere of virality. One extremely popular tweet shared by thousands of people even claimed the Hamas attack was a US-led psyop.
The rise of the Islamophobic 'disinfluencer'
BOOM, one of India's most reputed fact-checking services, found several verified Indian X users at the helm of a disinformation campaign.
These "disinfluencers" - influencers who have routinely shared disinformation - have been "mostly targeting Palestine negatively, or being supportive of Israel", according to BOOM.
They have peddled tropes that have sought to showcase Palestinians as fundamentally brutal.
In one instance, an account began circulating a video  that claimed to show dozens of young girls taken as sex slaves by a "Palestinian" fighter. However, the video was likely from a school trip to Jerusalem. While relatively low quality, if you look carefully, you can see girls happily chatting and using their phones.
Despite this, the video got thousands of retweets and racked up at least 6 million impressions. An analysis of the accounts sharing the video showed that most were based in India.
It was even shared in the Telegram channel of Angry Saffron, an apparent open-source intelligence or OSINT channel operating from India. This suggests either sloppy intelligence or disinformation aimed at exploiting the credibility that the description "OSINT" might imply.
In another instance, a video circulated that falsely claimed to show Hamas kidnapping a Jewish baby. The video garnered more than a million views in one post alone. Seven of the top 10 most-shared tweets featuring the misleading video were profiles based in India or containing the Indian flag in their biography.
These seven tweets alone received more than 3 million impressions on X. However, the video was from September and had nothing to do with kidnapping or indeed with Gaza.
Islamophobia, India and social media
Many of the accounts sharing these false videos also spend a lot of their time posting anti-Muslim comments on X.
One account, Mr Sinha_, who shared the false video of a boy being beheaded by Hamas, included the hashtag #IslamIsTheProblem in the same post.
Another account that shared the misleading video of Palestinians kidnapping sex slaves had previously written:'The only difference is when Muslim girls convert to Hinduism they live happily ever after. But when Hindu girls convert to Islam they end up in a suitcase or a fridge.'
Others have been more explicit in their hatred of Palestine. One Indian account, purporting to belong to a retired Indian soldier, stated, "Israel must finish off Palestine from the planet."
It is no secret that India has an Islamophobia problem, one that   since the rise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
A report by the Australia-based Islamic Council of Victoria found that the majority of all Islamophobic tweets can be traced back to India.
The plight of Palestinians has drawn Islamophobes like moths to a light and this can be witnessed on social media. Part of this online hatred can be traced to what has been called the "BJP's IT Cell", who have fanned the flames of hatred.
In her book, I Am a Troll, Swati Chaturvedi discusses the BJP's online social media army. According to Sadhavi Khosla, one of Chaturvedi's interviewees, 'The BJP has a network of volunteers who take instructions from the social media cell, and two affiliated organisations, to troll critical voices."
Khosla said she left the "IT Cell" after tiring of the constant barrage of "misogyny, Islamophobia and hatred" she had to disseminate.
A perfect storm: Musk, BJP and #GazaUnderAttack
While the BJP's IT Cell may have an Islamophobia problem, it also has a disinformation problem, and it is coming to the conflict in Gaza
Pratik Sinha, a co-founder and editor of the Indian non-profit fact-checking website AltNews, tweeted: 'With India now exporting its disinformation actors in the Indian mainstream media and on social media in support of Israel, hopefully the world will now realise how the Indian right-wing has made India the disinformation capital of the world".
Elon Musk's acquisition of X and his decision to scale back efforts to curb lies spread on the platform has potentially set a precedent that might be influencing other technology giants in their approach towards managing harmful content. Notably, companies like Meta and YouTube appear to be re-evaluating their existing commitments to mitigating hate speech, disinformation and other detrimental content on their platforms.
Last week, the European Union even sent a warning to Musk following the deluge of disinformation on X following the Hamas attack on Israel.
Western support of Israel, Big Tech's renewed indifference to content moderation and the digital reach of right-wing Islamophobic accounts from India are turning the Gaza crisis into a springboard of hate targeted at Palestinians and Muslims.

Thousands join pro-Palestinian rallies in Australia amid Gaza bombardment

Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Australia's biggest city to express solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel's bombardment of Gaza.
About 15,000 attended the rally in Sydney on Saturday, organiser the Palestine Action Group said, with protesters chanting 'free, free Palestine" and 'down, down Israel".
Thousands more Australians attended rallies in Perth, Brisbane and Hobart, with more pro-Palestinian events scheduled to take place on Sunday in Melbourne and Adelaide.
"It's difficult, what has been broadcasted in the Western media is definitely not reflecting what is on the ground," Abdullah Ali, who attended the Sydney rally, was quoted as saying by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
"What I see isdifferent I see parts of children being put in plastic bags, it's extremely hard for anyone to see."
At least 4,137 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its bombardment of the enclave in response to attacks by Hamas on October 7, according to Palestinian officials.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to continue the offensive on Gaza until the Palestinian armed group is eliminated amid expectations that Israeli troops will soon launch a ground invasion of the enclave.
Oxfam and United Nations agencies have warned that the enclave is facing a humanitarian catastrophe as residents risk contracting cholera and other deadly infectious diseases due to the   services.
Saturday's rally went ahead peacefully after receiving last-minute approval from police, following controversy over a previous event that featured anti-Jewish slogans.
Organisers had warned that anti-Jewish chants, flag burning and flares would not be tolerated during the event.
There were no reports of arrests.
New South Wales Premier Chris Minns had earlier promised "zero tolerance" for violence or hate speech.

Egypt's el-Sisi says future Palestinian state could be 'demilitarised'

A future Palestinian state could be demilitarised and have a temporary international security presence, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has said.
"We said that we are ready for this state to be demilitarised, and there can also be guarantees of forces, whether NATO forces, United Nations forces, or Arab or American forces, until we achieve security for both states, the nascent Palestinian state and the Israeli state," el-Sisi said on Friday during a joint news conference in Cairo with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo.
A political resolution which calls for a Palestinian state based on the June 4, 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, has remained out of reach, el-Sisi added.
Arab nations have rejected suggestions that an Arab force could provide security in the Gaza Strip after the end of Israel's current military operation there against the Palestinian group Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007.
Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told reporters in London this week that Arab states would not want to go into a Gaza Strip that could be turned into a "wasteland" by Israel's military offensive.
"What are the circumstances under which any of us would want to go and be seen as the enemy and be seen as having come to clean up Israel's mess?" he said.
Shoring up support for an international peace conference
The Spanish prime minister, whose new government was sworn in earlier this month, is visiting the region alongside his Belgian counterpart. Their two countries hold the current and upcoming rotating presidencies of the Council of the European Union, respectively.
Sanchez has been trying to   momentum for an international peace conference aimed at securing the establishment of a "viable" Palestinian state, he told Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.
Last week, Sanchez said a Union for the Mediterranean summit in Barcelona on November 27-28 would be an 'ideal place' to relaunch Israeli-Palestinian dialogue as the two sides would 'sit on an equal footing' there.
Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs limited parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, are members of the Mediterranean grouping along with neighbours Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and Syria.
Later on Friday, Sanchez and de Croo visited the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, currently the only one providing access to the besieged enclave.
De Croo called on Israel to open more of Gaza's crossings 'because innocent civilians are suffering and they need help.'
Sanchez said during the visit to Rafah that the current   in Gaza is not enough and that a permanent ceasefire was needed.
Combat between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters halted on Friday for the first time in seven weeks before the planned release of civilian hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
The fighting erupted on October 7 when Hamas carried out an attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has responded with a devastating assault on Gaza, killing more than 15,000 people, including more than 6,000 children, according to Palestinian authorities.

'We reject the forced displacement' in Gaza: Abbas tells Blinken in Jordan

October 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that he "rejects the forced displacement" of Palestinians from Gaza, following Israel's order for all of the enclave's civilians to move to the south.
Abbas said at Friday's meeting in Jordan's capital Amman that such an event would constitute a "second Nakba", referring to the mass displacement of Palestinians in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
He also said that humanitarian corridors must be allowed in the blockaded coastal enclave immediately to prevent a humanitarian disaster, the report said.
Al Jazeera's diplomatic editor James Bays said Blinken was in Jordan to negotiate, not to ask for the cessation of hostilities.
"Blinken is expected to also travel to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt to make progress on the release of American captives held by Hamas and negotiate the safe exit of 500 to 600 US citizens or dual nationals currently in Gaza," he said.
"The diplomatic trip is also aiming to avoid a regional escalation of the war. But not the cessation of hostilities. He is not saying Israel should stop the aggression on Gaza," Bays added.
Earlier on Friday, Blinken met Jordan's King Abdullah II who also called for "opening humanitarian corridors to allow for the entry of urgent medical and relief aid to Gaza, and protecting civilians and stopping the escalation and war on Gaza", a statement from the royal court said.
Meanwhile, thousands of people gathered in Amman on Friday for a demonstration in support of Palestinians.
More than 10,000 people massed in the centre of the city near the Grand Husseini Mosque.
They held banners, reading: "The victory march will continue, solidarity with Palestine" and "Stand with Palestine, Liberated Palestine".
There was a heavy police presence in the area, according to the AFP news agency.
Witnesses said police fired tear gas to halt about 500 demonstrators who had reached a security checkpoint outside Amman on a highway leading to a main border crossing with Israel.
Jordan is worried that a regional widening of violence arising from the Israel-Hamas war could have repercussions for itself given that a large percentage of its population is Palestinian.
Israel is in the middle of a war to "destroy" Hamas, an armed group that rules the Gaza Strip, after the Palestinian fighters stormed its southern border over the weekend and killed more than 1,300 people.
Israel has since been pounding Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, where 1,537 people have been killed.
The Israeli military said it has dropped 6,000 bombs on the Gaza Strip since October 7, nearly matching the number of bombs the US used in Afghanistan in one year.
Afghanistan is almost 1,800 times bigger than the besieged enclave.

At least 199 people being held captive by Hamas, Israel says

The Israeli military has raised to 199 the number of people it says are being held captive by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
'We have updated the families of 199 hostages," military spokesperson Daniel Hagari told a media briefing on Monday.
'The efforts on the hostages are a top national priority. The army and Israel are working around the clock to bring them back."
Israeli officials had previously estimated that 155 people were being held captive by the Palestinian armed group.
Hamas abducted Israelis and foreigners into Gaza during its October 7 attacks on Israel, the deadliest on the country in decades.
The multipronged attack, dubbed  , killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, and wounded about 3,500 others, according to Israeli officials.
Israel responded with intense air attacks on Gaza, levelling once densely populated neighbourhoods and imposing a total blockade on the enclave.
About 2,800 people have been killed and more than 10,000 injured in the besieged enclave and occupied West Bank, according to Palestinian officials. A further 1,000 people are believed to be trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings.
Hamas on Sunday said that nine captives had been killed in Israeli airstrikes in the past 24 hours.
The announcement came a day after the group said 13 captives had been killed in Israel's bombardment, which Israeli officials denied.
The latest claim, which raises the number of captives allegedly killed to 22, could not be independently verified.
On Monday, the Reuters news agency cited two unnamed Egyptian security sources as saying that an agreement had been reached to open the Rafah crossing and allow much-needed aid into the enclave.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office denied that any ceasefire had been reached.
'There is currently no truce and humanitarian aid in Gaza in exchange for getting foreigners out,' it said in a statement.
United States President Joe Biden has stressed the need for humanitarian aid for Palestinians in calls with Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
Washington is also seeking to evacuate its citizens and has told people to get close to the crossing so they can leave.
There are 500-600 dual-citizen Palestinian-Americans in Gaza, according to US government estimates.

Biden has also urged Israel to follow the rules of war in its response to the Hamas attacks in contrast to earlier statements supporting Israel's right to retaliate.
'The overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas's appalling attacks and are suffering as a result of them,' Biden said on Sunday.
Gaza on Monday entered its fifth consecutive day without electricity, pushing vital services, including healthcare, water supply and sanitation, to the brink of collapse.

November 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Three young Palestinian men have been shot near a university campus in Vermont in the US weeks after a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy was  , raising alarms against rising Islamophobia in the country.
Critics say the media coverage and the political discourse in the US have caused anti-Arab and anti-Islam sentiment to rise amid Israel's war on Gaza which has killed nearly 15,000 Palestinians.
Here is what to know about  :
What happened in Vermont and when?
Three students of Palestinian descent were shot in what investigators suspect was a hate-motivated crime.
According to police, the victims were speaking Arabic and two of them were wearing a   when attacked. Two were shot in the torso and one in the 'lower extremities'.
Police were searching for the suspect   at around 6:25pm (23:25 GMT) on Saturday, Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad said in a statement on Sunday.
Two of the men were in stable condition and the other suffered 'much more serious injuries', the police chief added.
The shooter, a man, without speaking, discharged at least four rounds from the pistol and is believed to have fled, the police chief said.
Where in Burlington did the attack happen?
The attack took place on North Prospect street in Burlington near the University of Vermont.
According to local media reports the students were walking on the street while visiting the home of one of their families in Burlington for the Thanksgiving holiday when they were attacked by a man with a gun.
Who are the three Palestinian students who were shot?
The families identified the victims as Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ahmed.
All three are graduates of the Ramallah Friends School, a private Quaker secondary school in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the families said. All are 20 years old.
Two of the victims are US citizens and the third is a legal US resident, police said.
Hisham Awartani:
Awartani was identified as Palestinian-Irish-American. He is a student at Brown University and described "as a math genius".
Awartani's great-uncle Marwan Awartani, a former Palestinian education minister, told The New York Times that "a bullet had struck Hisham's spinal cord, and he lost feeling in the lower part of his body. He remained hospitalised on Sunday evening".
He is 'expected to survive his injuries', Christina Paxson, the president of Brown University said in a statement.
"There are not enough words to express the deep anguish I feel for Hisham, his parents and family members, and his friends. I know that this heinous and despicable act of violence – this latest evidence of anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian discrimination and hate spiraling across this country and around the world – will leave many in our community deeply shaken," Paxson added.
Hisham Awartani is a Palestinian American junior at Brown University, described as a math genius. He was shot by a white man yesterday in Vermont along with his friends Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ahmed. The 3 students were wearing kuffiyehs.

Kinnan Abdalhamid:
Abdalhamid is currently a student at Haverford College.
In a statement, the college said it was in touch with his family "who live overseas".
'Kinnan and his friends are all Palestinian students studying at US colleges and universities. Police are investigating the shootings, and we await word on whether it will be pursued as a hate crime,' the release said. 'In the meantime, know that Haverford College condemns all acts of hatred.'
Tahseen Ali Ahmed:
Ahmed, a student  at Trinity College in Connecticut, was reportedly shot in the chest.
"He is in stable condition at an area hospital, and he is aware this message is being released," Trinity College said in a statement. 'At this moment, please keep Tahseen and his friends in your heart,' the statement added.

Who was behind the attack?
Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrested Jason J Eaton, 48, while conducting a search of the shooting area in Burlington at 3:38pm (20:38 GMT) on Sunday, the Burlington Police Department said in a statement.
Authorities collected evidence during a search of Eaton's apartment in a building in front of the shooting location. He is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday, police said.
What was the motive behind the attack?
Police chief Jon Murad said in a statement: "In this charged moment, no one can look at this incident and not suspect that it may have been a hate-motivated crime."
"And I have already been in touch with federal investigatory and prosecutorial partners to prepare for that if it's proven," Murad added.
'The fact is that we don't yet know as much as we want to right now,' the police chief added. 'But I urge the public to avoid making conclusions based on statements from uninvolved parties who know even less.'
The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee releaseda statement Sunday saying that there is 'reason to believe this shooting occurred because the victims are Arab'.
What are people saying?
The Institute for Middle East Understanding posted a statement on X that the institute said was from the victims' families.
"We are extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of our children,' the statement said. 'We call on law enforcement to conduct a thorough investigation, including treating this as a hate crime. We will not be comfortable until the shooter is brought to justice.'

In response to the shooting, US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries encouraged people to 'unequivocally denounce the startling rise of anti-Arab hate and Islamophobia in America'.
Governor Phil Scott called the shooting a tragedy, calling on the state's residents to unite and 'not let this incident incite more hate or divisiveness'.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said on Sunday it would offer a $10,000 reward for "information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator or perpetrators" involved in the shooting.
Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent, also denounced the shooting.
'It is shocking and deeply upsetting that three young Palestinians were shot here in Burlington, VT [Vermont]. Hate has no place here, or anywhere,' Sanders said in a statement.
It is shocking and deeply upsetting that three young Palestinians were shot here in Burlington, VT. Hate has no place here, or anywhere. I look forward to a full investigation. My thoughts are with them and their families.

"Three young Palestinian men… were shot last night on their way to a family dinner … Their crime? Wearing the Palestinian keffiyeh. They are critically injured," Husam Zomlot, the head of the Palestinian Mission to the UK said on X.
"Six weeks ago, [a] six-year-old Palestinian child was stabbed 26 times in a hate crime in Illinois. The hate crimes against Palestinians must stop. Palestinians everywhere need protection," he added.
The coalition of Ivy League students for Palestine asked for students across Brown, Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth College, Harvard, Penn, Princeton and Yales to "wear their keffiyehs and the colors of the Palestinian flag in solidarity. In the face of hatred, we will not stand down".

Hamas says it will release some foreign hostages in coming days

October 31st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The armed wing of the Palestinian group   has said that it will release some foreign hostages from Gaza in the coming days, without offering more specifics.
Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Obeida announced the decision in a video address on Tuesday, in which he also promised to turn Gaza into a 'graveyard' and a 'quagmire' for Israeli forces amid increased  .
"We have informed intermediaries that we will release a certain number of foreigners in the next few days," Obeida said.
More than 230 people, including Israeli soldiers and civilians, as well as foreigners from numerous countries, were   by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups during a deadly assault on Israel on October 7 that Israeli authorities say killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
Israel, human rights groups and the United Nations have called for the immediate release of the hostages, and those with loved ones held captive have   to secure their release.
'Hamas and Islamic Jihad are committing war crimes by holding scores of Israelis and others as hostages in Gaza,' the rights group Human Rights Watch said in an earlier statement. 'No grievance can justify holding anyone hostage,' it added.
Five hostages have been released thus far, most of them following negotiations through diplomatic channels with assistance from countries including Qatar and Egypt, and one after a ground raid by Israeli forces inside Gaza.
On Tuesday, Israeli families of those killed on October 7 called on the International Criminal Court (ICC), the jurisdiction of which Israel does not recognise, to investigate the  .
Tel Aviv-based international lawyer Yael Vias Gvirsman, representing the families of more than 34 victims, filed an "article 15 communication" with the ICC, urging ICC prosecutor Karim Khan to focus an ongoing investigation into alleged crimes within its jurisdiction on the Hamas attack.
The news outlet Reuters confirmed that the ICC prosecutor's office has received the filing and is assessing the request.
Israel is not a party to the ICC, whose jurisdiction it has refused to recognise. Palestinian authorities joined the court in 2015 and were granted UN observer state status, allowing   to begin a continuing investigation into alleged crimes committed on Palestinian territory and by Palestinians on Israeli territory.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called that decision a 'perversion of justice' at the time.
During a visit to the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza over the weekend, Khan said that impeding aid access to Gaza could   under ICC jurisdiction.
He also said that he had tried to enter Gaza and Israel to meet with families of victims, but had not been able to do so.

Egyptian swimmer Abdelrahman Sameh says he has "been getting death threats" for showing solidarity with the people of Palestine, adding he could not celebrate his gold medal at the World Aquatics Swimming World Cup 2023 as war rages on in Gaza.
Sameh - also known as Abdelrahman Elaraby - won the men's 50-metre butterfly final at the tournament held in Greece last week, but said on Sunday it was difficult for him to celebrate it after a "mentally tough week".
'I have been getting death threats - people have been attacking me all week for supporting Palestine,' he said when asked to speak about his win.
'My family goes to sleep, not knowing if someone is going to break into my room, if somebody is going to break into my apartment. They have to wonder every time I don't pick up a call, 'Is he busy or is someone trying to kill him?'"

'My brothers and sisters are being killed in Palestine'
The 23-year-old Egyptian is part of the University of Notre Dame's swimming and diving team in Indiana, United States.
He beat favourites Isaac Cooper of Australia and Michael Andrew of the US to win his first-ever gold medal at the World Cup but refused to celebrate it.
"My brothers and sisters are being killed in Palestine, and I'm threatened with death just because it's a cause I'm standing for.'
The medal win came five days after Sameh posted a message on his Instagram account, saying critics had accused him of "supporting terrorism" because he had spoken against Israel's attacks on Gaza.
"I want to emphasise that my support for the Palestinian cause is rooted in a belief in the value of all human lives," he said.

'Where's Sameh?'
Sameh has been posting news and images from the war in Gaza in an act of solidarity with the people of the besieged Strip - an act that has not gone down well with Israeli swimming officials.
One of his earlier social media posts included a political cartoon that showed the different perceptions of resistance by Palestinians and Ukrainians, according to a report on the swimming website SwimSwam .
On Friday, Israel Swimming Association Chairman Miki Halika wrote to World Aquatics - swimming's global governing body - urging it to "take action against swimmers who support terrorism".
"It is disheartening to see extremist ideologies tarnishing the reputation of our beloved sport," Halika wrote in his complaint.
Sameh competed in the 50m final two days later and won it.
However, some users on X, earlier known as Twitter, noted that the Egyptian was missing or cropped out from the image showing the final list of winners that was posted on the World Aquatics account, leading them to start the trend "#WeStandWithAbdelrahmanSameh".
Some users asked the world body "where's Sameh" and others slammed it for allegedly cropping him out.

Meanwhile, Tunisia's Olympic swimming champion Ahmed Hafnaoui has also been at the receiving end of threats and was one of the swimmers whom Halika targeted in his letter.
Hafnaoui, who won the 400m freestyle gold at Tokyo 2020, has posted a link to a fundraiser collecting aid for the people in Palestine who are affected by the war.
He was targeted by American swimmer Eli Cohen, who told Hafnaoui he was asking people to "donate to terror".
The Tunisian has been a consistent supporter of the Palestinian cause.
After winning gold in Tokyo, the 20-year-old dedicated his medal to his country, but also famously added: 'May Allah bless the Palestinian people. Amen!'
'Incredibly important to Palestinian people'
Last week, fans of Scotland's Celtic Football Club   to continue their display of solidarity with the people of Palestine despite backlash from the club's board and a former player.
These acts of solidarity by athletes, teams and fans are 'incredibly important to the Palestinian people, who are being bombarded and targeted", said Abdullah al-Arian, associate professor of history at Georgetown University in Qatar.
Al-Arian told Al Jazeera last week that it was 'becoming increasingly hard' to show support for the Palestinians in Western countries because some governments in Europe have   against the Israeli attacks in Gaza and have threatened to bar the display of the Palestinian flag.
'Especially as we see the posture of the media and government as being one silencing and intimidation of people who are simply standing up for human rights of the people of Palestine."
