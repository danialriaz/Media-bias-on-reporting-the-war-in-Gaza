How a watermelon became a symbol of Palestinian solidarity
The Times of India (TOI)
November 15, 2023 Wednesday

The watermelon has gained global recognition and popularity as a symbol of Palestinian solidarity, especially in the recent escalation of violence and aggression by Israel against the Palestinians in Gaza Strip. Many people around the world have used the watermelon emoji, images, and artworks to express their support and sympathy for the Palestinian cause. The watermelon has become a universal sign of solidarity with the oppressed and a demand for peace and justice in the region.Palestinians have used the watermelon in various forms of expression, such as art, graffiti, poetry, and protests, to show their identity, culture, and aspirations for freedom and justice.HistoryThe origins of the watermelon as a symbol of Palestinian solidarity can be traced back to the aftermath of the Six-Day War in 1967, as reported by TIME. 
This conflict resulted in Israel's control over Gaza and the West Bank. In response to this occupation, the Israeli government prohibited the display of the Palestinian flag in these territories.In an ingenious act of defiance, Palestinians turned to the watermelon, which, when cut open, revealed the same colors as their flag – a silent yet powerful form of protest against the ban. This creative use of the watermelon allowed Palestinians to subtly express their national identity and resistance.The prohibition on the Palestinian flag was eventually lifted in 1993 through the Oslo Accords, a set of agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). However, the watermelon had already established itself as a poignant symbol of Palestinian solidarity and resilience during this challenging period.Symbolism of colorsThe watermelon, when sliced open, reveals the same colors as the Palestinian flag: red, black, white, and green. Each color on the flag has its own significance: green represents the land and agriculture, black symbolizes the dark periods of the Palestinian history, white stands for peace, and red signifies the bloodshed in the struggle for freedom. The watermelon, with its natural embodiment of these colors, becomes a powerful symbol of Palestinian identity and resilience.The employment of the watermelon emoji in social media conversations is an example of "algospeak," a term TechCrunch defines as "coded euphemisms used online" to circumvent content filtering systems. This practice involves using seemingly innocuous symbols or language to convey messages that might otherwise be flagged or censored by automated moderation tools.

Shashi Tharoor, IUML clash over who the terrorist in Gaza conflict is

KOZHIKODE: Thousands of people converged on Kozhikode beach on Thursday afternoon in the largest pro-Palestine rally to take place in the country ever since the Israel-Palestine conflict began. The rally was organised by IUML.The IUML activists, including hundreds of women, chanted "Solidarity with Palestine" and "Down with Zionism" on the beach, and held banners - inscribed in Arabic - that read "Indians with Palestine" and "End the genocide in Gaza".Inaugurating the rally, IUML state president Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal said "Israel was the biggest terrorist nation" in the world and added that the Indian government was "trying to whitewash Israel".Thangal said that while all Indian PMs, from Jawaharlal Nehru to Manmohan Singh, including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had sided with justice and had taken a stand against the Israeli occupation of Palestine, the current central government was trying to dilute that stand.However, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who was the chief guest at the event, tacitly referred to Hamas as terrorists in his address, drawing a response from IUML leader M K Muneer."Terrorists attacked Israel on October 7 and killed 1,400 people and took 400 as hostages, and in retaliation Israel has killed over 6,000 people in bombings carried out in Gaza, which have still not stopped," Tharoor said, adding, that the Israeli response to the attack was disproportionate and in contravention of human rights conventions. 
Muneer, who was the last to speak, said "It is a fight for independence by Palestinians, but what Israel is doing is ethnic genocide. We are with the resistance of the people of Palestine, and we should be able to identify between resistance and attack." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israel calls out Greta Thunberg over support for Palestine, Gaza

NEW DELHI: Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg is facing strong criticism over a social media post supporting Palestines and Gaza.In a X (formerly Twitter) post made on October 20, Greta can be seen holding a "stand with Gaza" placard along with 3 others also holding pro-palestine, climate awareness posters. Greta had posted the photo with a caption, "Week 270. Today we strike in solidarity with Palestine and Gaza. The world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected."Following the post, the 20-year old was slammed by Israel's official account, who quoted Greta's tweet with pictures of reported victims of Hamas attack. 
They also seemed to mock Greta's environment awareness activities with the caption, "@GretaThunberg, Hamas doesn't use sustainable materials for their rockets which have BUTCHERED innocent Israelis. The victims of the Hamas massacre could have been your friends. Speak up."However, few users came to the support of Greta Thunberg calling out Israel. One user replied to the Israel account's tweet, "your subconscious and true ideals leaked. She said gaza, not hamas. This says a lot. good luck editing this next." Another posted, "This is the most desperate tweet for the year, we should nominate this guys." Another voiced support for Palestines by replying, "We stand with the people of Palestine and will continue to stand with them until the persecution of the people of Palestine end."Greta had posted this cropped photo with the clarification after she faced severe backlash after the first post which had a stuffed Blue Octopus which can be seen as an anti-semitism symbol, which she deleted.

'Generational trauma of my Palestinian blood': Bella Hadid's plea for peace in Middle East

NEW DELHI: Supermodel Bella Hadid, who is of Palestinian descent, broke her silence on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, penning a long note highlighting the hardships and suffering experienced by innocent Palestinians, reported TMZ.“Forgive me for my silence,” Hadid wrote on Instagram Thursday. “I have yet to find the ideal words for this deeply intricate and horrific past 2 weeks, weeks that have turned the world’s attention back towards a situation that has been taking innocent lives and affecting families for decades.”Bella Hadid's father, Mohamed Hadid, fled the region with his family during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War when he was just a baby. Both Bella Hadid and her sister, model Gigi Hadid, have strongly connected with their Palestinian heritage and actively supported the Palestinian cause.Bella Hadid also revealed that her personal phone number was leaked, leading to her receiving hundreds of death threats daily. Despite the danger to her family, she emphasized her determination not to remain silent.“My heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,” Hadid wrote. 
“Seeing the aftermath from the airstrikes in Gaza, I mourn with all the mothers who have lost children and the children who cry alone, all the lost fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunties, friends that will never again walk this earth.”She said she mourned, too, for the Israeli families suffering in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas militants, who killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and took more than 200 hostages, according to the government.“Regardless of the history of the land, I condemn the terrorist attacks on any civilians, anywhere,” Hadid wrote. “Harming women and children and inflicting terror does not and should not do any good for the Free Palestine movement.”Hadid additionally provided context regarding her father's relocation from Nazareth during the Nakba, an Arabic term signifying the "catastrophe," describing the large-scale displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 war. Mohamed Hadid and his family were forcibly removed from Palestine, transforming into refugees, away from the place they once called home.She also addressed the profound suffering caused by Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories over the ensuing decades. Since its occupation of the West Bank in the 1967 war, Israel has constructed numerous settlements, despite these actions being widely regarded as violations of international law and counter to a United Nations plan that initially reserved the West Bank for a future Palestinian state.“My family witnessed 75 years of violence against Palestinian people,” Bella Hadid wrote. “Most notably, brutal settler invasions which led to the destruction of entire communities, murder in cold blood and the forcible removal of families from their homes.”“The practice of settlements on Palestinian land still continues to this day,” she added.She highlighted the pressing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which has been under Israeli blockade since the October 7th attack. The Hamas group governs this Palestinian area, home to over 2 million residents. Israel has halted the supply of essential resources, resulting in a high casualty toll, including many children, due to weeks of airstrikes.“Wars have laws - and they must be upheld, no matter what,” Hadid wrote.“We need to keep pressure on our leaders, wherever we are, not to forget the urgent needs of the people of Gaza, and to ensure that innocent Palestinian civilians are not the forgotten casualties of this war.”(via media reports) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: NBA player Kyrie Irving, known for his support for the Palestinian cause, made a bold statement over the weekend during the Dallas Mavericks game against the Milwaukee Bucks. Irving appeared at the game wearing a keffiyeh on his head, symbolizing solidarity with the Palestinian people, particularly in the context of Israel's conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.Irving continued to wear the keffiyeh during the press conference after the game, but he did not elaborate on his choice of attire, and journalists present did not inquire about it.The NBA star's gesture garnered extensive attention in the Arab world, where it was celebrated, especially considering the general support for Israel among NBA players following the October 7 massacre.Irving's symbolic act sparked a mix of reactions on social media. 
Dr. Omar Suleiman, a Muslim American imam known for sharing critical views on Israel, expressed support for Irving's gesture, sharing images of Muhammad Ali and Nelson Mandela wearing keffiyehs. However, Irving faced criticism from supporters of Israel, with some accusing him of antisemitism.Irving, who converted to Islam several years ago, has a history of supporting the Palestinian cause. In November, he mourned the casualties in the Gaza Strip, and in August, he shared a photo from the funeral of Qusai Jamal Ma'atan, a Palestinian killed in the West Bank.The NBA star has been vocal about his stance on Israel, accusing the country of harming innocent children and babies during Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. Irving's recent show of solidarity with the Palestinians has reignited discussions about his outspoken views and their impact on his career. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

31 Harvard student groups hold Israel 'entirely responsible' for Hamas attack

NEW DELHI: Havard University student organizations have blamed Israel for Hamas' mass slaughter in which 700 Israelis were killed, the New York Post reported.A group of 31 Harvard organizations, including the Ivy League's affiliate of Amnesty International, has condemned Israel. The groups claimed that Hamas' attack "did not happen in a vacuum," and the Israeli government has forced the Palestinians to live in an "open-air prison for over two decades," according to the letter obtained by The Post."We, the undersigned student organizations, hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence," the letter reads. The group further claimed that the apartheid regime was the only one to be blamed. 
"Israeli violence has structured every aspect of Palestinian existence for 75 years," they continue.The letter further stated that Palestinians went through a lot from systematized land seizures to routine airstrikes, arbitrary detentions, to military checkpoints, and enforced family separations to targeted killings. The Palestinians were forced to live in a state of death, both slow and sudden.""Today, the Palestinian ordeal enters into uncharted territory," the groups wrote. "The coming days will require a firm stand against retaliation."We call on the Harvard community to take action to stop the ongoing annihilation of Palestinians."The letter sparked almost immediate condemnation, including from Rep. Elise Stefanik, who graduated from Harvard in 2006."It is abhorrent and heinous that Harvard student groups are blaming Israel for Hamas' barbaric terrorist attacks that have killed over 700 Israelis," tweeted the New York rep, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee.Princeton professor Robert George also tweeted that 31 Harvard organizations have declared that the murders, rapes, kidnappings, and other atrocities committed by Hamas against innocent people are in no way the fault of Hamas, but are rather entirely the fault of Israel.Harvard's Palestine Solidarity Committee has previously come under fire for hosting anti-Israel events like a "Boycott Israel Trek," and has claimed responsibility for getting the Harvard Crimson - the school newspaper - to support the controversial Boycott, Divest, Sanctions movement.

Who is Hamas, the militant group that has launched an attack on Israel

NEW DELHI: At least 100 Israelis and  200 Palestinians were killed after the militant Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip carried out an unprecedented, multi-front attack on Israel, firing thousands of rockets. Dozens of Hamas fighters infiltrated the heavily fortified border in several locations and catching the country off-guard on a major holiday.Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Israel was "at war" and called for a mass mobilization of army reserves. The invasion revived memories of the 1973 war practically 50 years to the day.
Israel-Palestine crisis: Live updatesWhat is Hamas?Hamas is a Palestinian political and military organization that was founded in 1987 during the First Intifada, which was a Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. The name "Hamas" is an acronym in Arabic that stands for "Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya," which translates to "Islamic Resistance Movement" in English. It is backed by Shi'ite Iran and shares the Islamist ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was established in Egypt in the 1920s.It governs more than two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, but the group is best known for its armed resistance to Israel. Hamas is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the United States, European Union, Canada, Egypt and Japan.The group's charter calls for establishing an Islamic Palestinian state in place of Israel and rejects all agreements made between the PLO and Israel. Hamas has a military wing known as the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades that has conducted many anti-Israel attacks in both Israel and the Palestinian territories since the 1990s. These attacks have included large-scale bombings against Israeli civilian targets, small-arms attacks, improvised roadside explosives, and rocket attacks.This has led to ongoing conflicts and hostilities between Hamas and Israel, with Israel often launching military operations in response to Hamas's actions.How does Hamas govern Gaza?Hamas gained control of the Gaza Strip through elections in 2006. It has since governed Gaza, while the West Bank has been under the control of the Palestinian Authority, which is dominated by the Fatah political faction.In Gaza, Hamas routed Fatah's militias in a week of fighting, resulting in a political schism between the two Palestinian territories. Palestinians have not voted for a legislature since 2006, nor a president since 2008.How does Hamas challenge Israel?Hamas continues to refuse to recognise or renounce violent resistance against Israel and in early 2008 conducted a suicide bombing, killing one civilian, as well as numerous rocket and mortar attacks that have injured civilians. The US government has designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organization.Hamas in June 2008 entered into a six-month agreement with Israel that significantly reduced rocket attacks. Following the temporary calm, HAMAS resumed its rocket attacks, which precipitated a major Israeli military operation in late December 2008. After destroying much of Hamas' infrastructure in the Gaza Strip, Israel declared a unilateral cease-fire on 18 January 2009.In 2012, Israel killed Hamas's military chief of staff, Ahmad Jabari. Eight days of Palestinian militant rocket fire and Israeli air strikes followed.In 2014, the kidnaping and killing of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas led to a seven-week war in which more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in Gaza and 73 Israelis lost their lives, 67 of them military.Hamas and Israel entered one of their deadliest conflict in May 2021. Hundreds of Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli security forces at the Al Aqsa compound in Jerusalem, Islam's third holiest site. After demanding Israel withdraw security forces from the compound, Hamas unleashed a barrage of rockets from Gaza into Israel. Israel hit back with air strikes on Gaza. Fighting went on for 11 days, killing at least 250 people in Gaza and 13 in Israel. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Former Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal addresses pro-Palestine rally in Kerala's Malappuram

KOCHI: Former chief of Hamas, Khaled Meshaal, virtually addressed a pro-Palestine rally held in Malappuram district of Kerala on Friday.The "Youth Resistance Rally" with a tagline of "Uproot Bulldozer Hindutwa and Apartheid Zionism" was organised by Solidarity Movement, an organisation under the state unit of Jamaate Islami Hind.The visuals of the rally held in Malappuram town shows that Meshaal addressed the rally in Arabic and it was a pre-recorded visual. The post-event press note issued by the organisers had described Khaled Meshaal as a "freedom fighter".The organisers had earlier announced that another leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh will also virtually address the rally, apart from Meshaal. But Haniyeh was unable to attend.Strongly coming up against the presence of Hamas leaders in the Malappuram rally, the state president of BJP K Surendran said that Khaled Meshaal’s address at the rally is alarming. 
"Where is Pinarayi Vijayan’s police? Under the disguise of 'Save Palestine' they are glorifying Hamas, a terrorist organisation and its leaders as 'warriors'. This is unacceptable", he wrote on the social media platform X, where he shared a photo of the virtual address of Khaled Meshaal at the rally.But, the organisers has justified the virtual presence of Meshaal in the rally. According to a statement issued by C T Shuhaib, the state president of Solidarity organisation, there is nothing unusual in the participation of Hamas leader in the rally as "Hamas" is a "resistance movement"."The Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) is an influential movement in Gaza and the West Bank. The party won 74 out of 132 seats in the last election. There is nothing unusual about the leader of such an organization speaking at a Palestinian solidarity event in Malappuram. Hamas is not an active or banned organization in India. So, the presence of a Hamas leader in the event is not against law”, says the statement."Sangh Parivar is carrying out a conspiracy to label those who stand in solidarity with Palestine as terrorists by spreading false propaganda. By doing so, they are trying to suppress the public protests against India’s support to Israel. Such attempts will not succeed. There will be many more solidarity events in India which will prove that the support of the Indian people will be for Palestine", added the statement.Solidarity has decided to go ahead with similar programs and campaigns against the Hindutva-Zionist alliance, it says.

NEW DELHI: Palestine supporters have been attempting cyber-attacks on Indian government websites, including those of the Delhi government and AIIMS, accusing India of siding with Israel, sources said Monday, setting off a retaliatory blitz.The Indian cyber establishment has successfully fended off attacks in the last 48 hours, most categorised as "denial of service" strikes. After the attempted invasions into the Delhi government and AIIMS sites on Monday, cyber groups with alleged links to India escalated their offensive against Palestinian establishments and targeted the Hamas website, besides the portals of the Palestinian National Bank and the National Telecommunications Company. Sources confirmed the Hamas site was disabled for a "substantial" period of time.These operators have also been working with pro-Israel groups like the ThreatSec, which allegedly compromised the infrastructure of Gaza-based ISP AlfaNet.One Palestinian group, which goes by the name "Ghosts of Palestine", even invited hackers from other countries to attack the infrastructure of Israel and its allies, including India. Several other groups, including one called "Libyan Ghosts", have joined them, according to their Telegram channel.As the Indian security establishment went on alert in the wake of the Hamas attack, cyber units upped their guard, too. The cyber wing of DRDO and CERT-IN have been tasked with thwarting attacks, officials said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

As al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza was hit by a huge explosion that killed hundreds of people, pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protesters clashed in New York City's Washington Square Park on Tuesday night.A video captured a pro-Palestinian protester setting fire to the Israeli flag and chanting 'Allahu Akbar!' along with others. The flag had the Star of David symbol of the Jewish state, the Daily Mail reported.There were hundreds of pro-Palestine demonstrators and dozens of pro-Israel counter-protesters at the park, according to reports.The pro-Palestine protest was led by NYU Students for Justice in Palestine and other campus groups. They criticized the university's president, Linda Mills, for her statement condemning the Hamas attack that killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians.The student group said that Mills' statement ignored the suffering of Palestinians and painted a false picture of only Israeli victims of 'terrorist attacks'."The statement makes no mention of the excessive violence against Palestinians in the last few days, despite 413 Palestinians having been murdered in Gaza within the past 48 hours. 
It is framed to portray an untrue and misrepresentative picture where 'terrorist attacks' were only occurring against Israeli citizens," the student group said.The two sides of protesters confronted each other at the park. The NYPD tried to keep them apart, as reported by NBC New York.CBS New York said that the NYPD Intel Division was monitoring social media for any possible threats.The New York Post reported that some pro-Palestinian protesters shouted 'You bombed a hospital! You bombed a hospital!' at the pro-Israel side.The pro-Israel side replied 'Bring them home! Terrorists! Terrorists! Terrorists!', referring to the hostages taken by Hamas after their attack.Maya, aged 59, travelled from New Jersey to express her solidarity with Israel, where her family resides in fear."I came to defend my homeland. My homeland. My family is there and it's not OK that bombs are flying over my mother-in-law's head when she's sleeping. She's a Holocaust survivor!" she told the New York Post."My parents hid from the Nazis because they were Jewish," she added, her voice filled with emotion. "After all those struggles, we finally have one Jewish state, and now they want to take it away from us!"Some protesters held signs calling for the US to stop funding Israel, while another held a sign to honor Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old from Illinois who was stabbed by a man allegedly influenced by the news of the attacks.Hundreds of people died in a huge explosion at a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, where many Palestinians were injured or taking refuge, the health ministry controlled by Hamas said. Hamas accused Israel of launching an airstrike, but the Israeli army said it was a rocket launched by Islamic Jihad, a smaller and more extreme Palestinian militant faction allied with Hamas.The Israeli army said Islamic Jihad was responsible for the blast, saying the group had fired a volley of rockets near the hospital and that "multiple sources of intelligence" confirmed this.The army's chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, told reporters that there were no Israeli air, ground or naval attacks in the area when the blast happened. He said radar detected incoming rocket fire at the same time, and communications intercepted between militant groups showed that Islamic Jihad had fired the rockets.Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden, who is on way to Israel, has cancelled his trip to Jordan in the wake of the blast at the Gaza hospital.

NEW DELHI: NBA player Kyrie Irving, known for his support for the Palestinian cause, made a bold statement over the weekend during the Dallas Mavericks game against the Milwaukee Bucks. Irving appeared at the game wearing a keffiyeh on his head, symbolizing solidarity with the Palestinian people, particularly in the context of Israel's conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.Irving continued to wear the keffiyeh during the press conference after the game, but he did not elaborate on his choice of attire, and journalists present did not inquire about it.The NBA star's gesture garnered extensive attention in the Arab world, where it was celebrated, especially considering the general support for Israel among NBA players following the October 7 massacre.Irving's symbolic act sparked a mix of reactions on social media. 
Dr. Omar Suleiman, a Muslim American imam known for sharing critical views on Israel, expressed support for Irving's gesture, sharing images of Muhammad Ali and Nelson Mandela wearing keffiyehs. However, Irving faced criticism from supporters of Israel, with some accusing him of antisemitism.Irving, who converted to Islam several years ago, has a history of supporting the Palestinian cause. In November, he mourned the casualties in the Gaza Strip, and in August, he shared a photo from the funeral of Qusai Jamal Ma'atan, a Palestinian killed in the West Bank.The NBA star has been vocal about his stance on Israel, accusing the country of harming innocent children and babies during Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021. Irving's recent show of solidarity with the Palestinians has reignited discussions about his outspoken views and their impact on his career. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

COIMBATORE: The Coimbatore city police booked three men for scaling an under-construction flyover in Ukkadam during a protest against Israel two days ago. The police charged that they had posed a threat to themselves as well as others as the flyover was not yet completed. 
The city police on Thursday clarified that a case registered against three men was not for placing a Palestine flag on the flyover. Some TV channels had telecast that an FIR had been registered against three people for keeping the Palestine flag on the parapet of the flyover. The Ukkadam police registered a case against MS Sabeer Ali, district secretary of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Abuthagir of Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi (MJK) and Rafiq under sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 290 (public nuisance) 341 (wrongful restrain) of the Indian Penal Code.“The protesters occupied the road and created a public nuisance. A few of them climbed an under-construction flyover, and the act was endangering humans. So, we booked the protesters,” said deputy commissioner of police Shanmugam.He added that many protesters held Palestine flags on their hands during the protest. “We did not register a case for possessing the Palestine flags,” said Shanmugam.A protest was held at Ukkadam on Tuesday evening by the Coimbatore District United Jamath, the Federation of Islamic Organisations and a few Muslim political outfits demanding that the world countries support Palestine and intervene immediately to save the Palestine people in Gaza. They condemned the Union government for supporting Israel. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Turkey's Erdogan calls for Gaza's incorporation into an independent Palestinian state

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan emphasized that Gaza should be a part of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state following the Israel-Hamas conflict, and Ankara will not support any plans aimed at gradually erasing Palestinians from history, as reported by Reuters.Erdogan's comments came one day ahead of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's scheduled visit to Ankara for discussions on Gaza.Turkey, as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza intensifies, has heightened its criticism of Israel and supports a two-state solution. Additionally, Turkey hosts members of Hamas, which it does not classify as a terrorist organization, in contrast to the United States, Britain, and other Western nations, as Reuters reported.Turkey has urged an immediate ceasefire and proposed the establishment of a mechanism to ensure it."Once all of this that is happening is finished, we want to see Gaza as a peaceful region that is a part of an independent Palestinian state, in line with 1967 borders, with territorial integrity, and with East Jerusalem as its capital," on Saturday, Erdogan was quoted as saying by broadcaster Haberturk and other sources."We will support formulas that will bring peace and calm to the region. We will not be supportive of plans that will further darken the lives of Palestinians, that will gradually erase them from the scene of history."Erdogan mentioned that his intelligence chief maintained contact with Israeli and Palestinian authorities, as well as Hamas, but he would no longer consider Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a counterpart. 
However, he emphasized that Turkey did not intend to sever ties with Israel.On the day before Blinken's visit, hundreds of protesters assembled in Ankara and Istanbul to express their opposition to the United States and Israel. The secretary of state is scheduled to meet with Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan on Monday, as reported by Reuters.Video footage from Ankara depicted demonstrators near the US Embassy, chanting slogans and displaying posters that read: "Israel bombs hospitals, Biden pays for it."In Istanbul's Sarachane Park, protesters displayed banners reading, "Blinken, the accomplice of the massacre, leave Turkey," featuring an image of Netanyahu and Blinken together marked with a red "X.""Children are dying, babies are dying there, being bombed," said 45-year-old teacher Gulsum Alpay.Turkey recalled its ambassador to Israel, Sakir Ozkan Torunlar, for consultations on Saturday, following Israel's previous recall of its envoys to Turkey. Israel had recalled its diplomats due to security concerns during pro-Palestinian protests in Turkey, which were triggered by Erdogan's characterization of Hamas as freedom fighters.In response to Israel's foreign ministry, Turkey's move to recall its ambassador was seen as "another step to side with the terrorist organization Hamas."Regarding Turkey's efforts to repair relations with Israel prior to the Israel-Hamas war, it was indeed working on improving ties after years of acrimony.Erdogan also mentioned that Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi is scheduled to visit Turkey at the end of November and that he would attend an Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit in Riyadh this month to discuss a ceasefire in Gaza.Erdogan expressed Turkey's commitment to backing efforts aimed at holding Israel accountable for alleged war crimes and human rights violations, emphasizing that a failure to do so would undermine trust in the global system.

Israel-Hamas conflict: Jordan's Queen Rania slams western world over 'glaring double standards'

NEW DELHI: Queen Rania of Jordan condemned the western world's reaction to the Hamas attack on Israel as against Israel's attack on Palestinians, calling it a "glaring double standard".Rania stated in a CNN interview that the people of Jordan and the Middle East were "shocked" to discover that the world vehemently denounced the cruel Hamas attack but is still standing by as a humanitarian crisis plays out in real-time in Gaza. "Are we being told that it is wrong to kill a family, an entire family, at gunpoint, but it's OK to shell them to death?" Rania asked. 
"I mean, there is a glaring double standard here. It is just shocking to the Arab world," she added.Calling out the skewed response to the ongoing conflict, Rania asked, "We are seeing staggering human suffering happening today, so why is the narrative always skewed towards the Israeli side?" "The Western media and policymakers are quick to adopt the Israeli narratives. When Israel attacks, Palestinians 'die,' but when Israelis die, they are 'killed,' murdered in cold blood," she added.Decrying the media for its coverage of the conflict, she said, "Most networks are covering the story under the title of 'Israel at war.""But for many Palestinians on the other side of the separation wall, on the other side of the barbed wire, war has never left," she added.Highlighting the age old Palestinian conflict, she said, "This is a 75-year-old story, a story of overwhelming death and displacement to the Palestinian people."According to the Palestinian health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, more than 5,700 Palestinians have died in the conflict so far, reported the Associated Press. Over 1,400 Israelis have died, the majority of them were civilians targeted by Hamas on October 7. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

That too, when it happens on a scale and intensity that is an affront to basic human values.”Describing the terror attacks in Israel on October 7 as shocking, Patel said they deserve condemnation.“Terrorism is a malignancy and knows no borders, nationality or race. The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts. Let us keep aside differences, unite and adopt a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism,” she had said.

How Netanyahu allowed Hamas to grow while undermining the Abbas govt in Palestine

NEW DELHI: The subsequent governments led by Benjamin Netanyahu over the years have taken a divide and conquer approach to control the Gaza Strip and the West Bank that involved undermining the authority of Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas while propping up the Hamas terrorist group, which has now carried out the deadliest attack against Israel in decades.According to an article in The Times of Israel by senior Israeli journalist Tal Schneider, Natanyahu and his advisors took the approach to prevent Abbas - or anyone else in the Palestinian Authority's West Bank government - from advancing towards the establishment of a Palestinian state.'Israel saw Hamas as an asset'In this effort, Hamas was upgraded from a mere terror group to an organisation with which Israel held indirect negotiations via Egypt, and one that was allowed to receive infusions of cash from abroad, said Schneider.Hamas was also included in discussions about increasing the number of work permits Israel granted to Gazan labourers, which kept money flowing into Gaza.Toward the end of Netanyahu's fifth government in 2021, approximately 2,000-3,000 work permits were issued to Gazans. This number climbed to 5,000 and, during the Bennett-Lapid government, rose sharply to 10,000, said Schneider.Since Netanyahu returned to power in January 2023, the number of work permits has climbed to nearly 20,000.Additionally, since 2014, the Netanyahu-led governments have practically turned a blind eye to the incendiary balloons and rocket fire from Gaza in order to maintain its fragile ceasefire with the Hamas rulers of the Strip.Most of the time, Israeli policy was to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset.Schneider said that Netanyahu, during a meeting of his Likud party in 2018, had reportedly said that those who oppose a Palestinian state should support the transfer of funds to Gaza, as maintaining separation between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza would prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.Policy backfiresThis policy of propping up Hamas has now backfired spectacularly with one of the bloodiest days suffered by Israel as Hamas terrorists slaughtered hundreds of Israelis and kidnapped an unknown number under the cover of thousands of rockets fired at towns throughout the country's south and centre.Just a few days ago, Assaf Pozilov, a reporter for the Kan public broadcaster, tweeted the following: "The Islamic Jihad organisation has started a noisy exercise very close to the border, in which they practiced launching missiles, breaking into Israel and kidnapping soldiers."Hamas became stronger and used the auspices of peace that Israelis so longed for as cover for its training, and hundreds of Israelis have paid with their lives for this massive omission, added Schneider.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan President Arif Alvi has retracted an earlier statement on the Palestinian issue in which he had suggested a one-state solution to the conflict if Israel did not agree to the long-advocated two-states plan.Alvi’s office had quoted him as suggesting to his Palestinian counterpart Mahmoud Abbas the one-state solution during a telephonic talk on Friday.“If two-states solution was not acceptable to Israel, then a one-state solution was the only way where Jews, Muslims and a good percentage of Christians could live to exercise equal political rights,” the previous statement read.Hours later, Alvi’s office issued a revised statement saying the President had assured Abbas that Pakistan would continue its support for resolving the Palestinian dispute in accordance with United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.Meanwhile, the foreign office reiterated Islamabad’s unwavering commitment to a fair and enduring resolution of the conflict, founded on the two-states solution.This, the foreign office stressed, would lead to a sovereign and viable Palestinian state with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital, along borders that existed prior to 1967, as enshrined in several resolutions of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).The same position was reiterated by caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar during a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Riyadh on Friday, the foreign office pointed out. 
Kakar had travelled to Saudi Arabia for an OIC summit convened to discuss the Gaza situation. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Congress on Monday came under pressure from its Kerala leader Ramesh Chenniathala that it take a line on the Israel-Palestine conflict that underlines the "two state" option, as he expressed resentment that the party had not reflected its traditional stance, endorsing Palestine in its statement earlier.On Sunday, Congress had slammed the "brutal attacks" on Israel and called for a dialogue, even as it endorsed the legitimate aspirations of the people of Palestine. The CWC resolution did not mention the brutality against Israeli citizens, making party's stand contrast clearly with PM Narendra Modi's unequivocal condemnation of "terrorist" attack by Hamas.Chennithala is learnt to have complained that India under Indira Gandhi was very close to the Palestine Liberation Organisation of Yasser Arafat, and the proximity appeared diluted by the statement issued on Sunday. He felt that the party while condemning the attacks on Israel, could have done a balancing job for Palestine.However, sources said a quick discussion ensued to settle the matter. 
Senior Kerala MP Shashi Tharoor and Jairam Ramesh are learnt to have said the proximity to Palestine under the PLO did exist, and the party was still supportive of the Palestine cause. But Hamas, as a militant outfit, could not be put on a par with PLO, and that was the only difference now.As the last paragraph of a two-page resolution, CWC said, "The CWC expresses its dismay and anguish on the war that has broken out in the Middle East where over a thousand people have been killed in the last two days. The CWC reiterates its long-standing support for the rights of the Palestinian people to land, self-government and to live with dignity and respect. The CWC calls for an immediate ceasefire and for negotiations to begin on all outstanding issues including the imperative issues that have given rise to the present conflict."

NEW DELHI: Joined by several opposition parties, Congress' Priyanka ?Gandhi Vadra on Saturday said she was 'shocked and ashamed' over New Delhi's decision to abstain from voting on the UN resolution on Gaza. "To refuse to take a stand and watch in silence as every law of humanity is pulverised and food, water, medical supplies, communication and power is cut off as people in Palestine are being annihilated goes against everything our country has stood for," she said.NCP's Sharad Pawar said there was confusion , with the PM and foreign minister speaking in different voices. BJP said India's position has been consistent and that it will 'never be on the side of terrorism.' India's explanation of the vote spelt this out clearly, the party said. Opposition attacks govt's Gaza stand, India won't back terror, says BJPCongress and Left parties attacked the Modi government over its decision to abstain from voting on UN resolution on Gaza, drawing a sharp riposte from BJP which stressed that the resolution was silent on Hamas' brutality and India could "never be on the side of terrorism", while also calling the opponents out over their participation in a rally allegedly addressed by a leader of Hamas.Objecting to India's stand over the resolution, Congress' Priyanka Gandhi said an 'eye-for-an-eye' makes the whole world go blind, and added that India was founded on the principles of non-violence and truth which represent the "moral courage of India that guided its actions as a member of the international community". "To refuse to take a stand and watch in silence as every law of humanity is pulverised and food, water, medical supplies, communication and power is cut off as people in Palestine are being annihilated goes against everything our country has stood for," she said.BJP hit back with senior party leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi saying in a series of posts on X: "Those who are 'ashamed and shocked', must realise that India will NEVER be on the side of terrorism."India abstained from voting, saying the resolution didn't mention the terror strike by Hamas on Israel on October 7, stoking the latest conflict.Asserting that India's position on the Palestine issue is steadfast and consistent, the BJP leader said that those who choose to side with terror do so at their own peril.BJP took the battle to the rival terrain by attacking Congress and Left over their participation in rally organised by the youth wing of Jamat-i-Islami in Kerala, which was allegedly addressed by Hamas leader Khaled Mashal. 
Describing Hamas as a terror outfit, BJP general secretary Dushyant Gautam said Congress and Left parties were guilty of "anti-national conduct". BJP spokesperson Anil Baluni said, "Congress is driven by the policy of appeasement and its views on Gaza reflect that it can go to any extent for vote-bank."NCP chief Sharad Pawar said, "I've never seen such confusion in India's position on the Israel-Palestine issue. When PM Modi issued a statement, he spoke of extending total support to Israel. When reactions to this statement started to be seen around the world & within India, foreign minister issued a statement in support of Palestine ... Thousands of people are dying in Gaza. India has never supported such violence."Calling Israel's attacks on Gaza as "genocidal", Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja expressed shock over India's abstention and called for an immediate ceasefire. They alleged that India's foreign policy was being "shaped by being a subordinate ally of US imperialism and the Modi government's actions for consolidating the US-Israel-India nexus".CPM announced a sit-in on Monday to show solidarity with the people of war-torn region.

NEW DELHI: Israeli-Palestinian conflict has become a topic of controversy at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, a private women's liberal arts institution. According to reports, some resident advisers at one of the campus dorms sent an email with anti-Israel sentiments to the students living there.In the email sent to Munger Hall residents, the residence hall leaders criticized Israel for its actions against Hamas and stated that there should be no place for Zionism within the Wellesley College community. The message was conveyed by Moi Nee, the Munger Hall house president, on behalf of the "Munger Res Staff.", reported Fox News."As of October 18th, 2023, the Palestinian-Israeli war has cost the lives of some 3,478 Palestinians and wounded 12,000. Israel’s apartheid against Palestinians, characterized by the displacement of 600,000 individuals, the dissemination of genocidal rhetoric by the Israeli government, and the illegal occupation of native Palestinian lands, have left our hearts heavy," the email stated. Taking into account all historical, political, and territorial factors, it is necessary to express strong disapproval of the Israeli Zionist government. 
Additionally, individuals who support the involuntary displacement of Palestinians should be identified as advocates for colonization."Munger Hall stands in strong condemnation of Israel's actions and those who have supported their actions against Palestinians. We firmly believe that there should be no space, no consideration, and no support for Zionism within the Wellesley College community," the email added.In addition to the comments, the residence hall leaders said they "plan on donating to a reputable organization that provides aid to the children and families whose lives have been destroyed."The residence hall leaders, who also pointed to campus resources as lines of support for students during "this devastating time," concluded the email by saying, "We care about each and every one of you, and please feel free to reach out with any ideas of how we can best support you during these difficult times."When contacted for a statement, a media relations representative from the school directed Fox News Digital to an email sent by Wellesley College President Paula Johnson to the community on October 20th. In the email, President Paula Johnson highlighted that the residential hall heads were informed of their duty to provide support to all students."It recently came to my attention that a small number of student residence hall leaders from one dormitory sent a letter to their housemates in their capacity as resident assistants that expressed views on the Israel-Hamas conflict," Johnson said in the email. "Our Student Life team met with these students and talked about their role and responsibility to support all students. They have since sent an apology to all students in the residence hall. That these young leaders were able to learn from this episode gives me hope."As president of Wellesley, I have often spoken about inclusive excellence and the importance of listening and learning across difference. Today, I feel even more strongly that this work is more necessary than ever and requires significant effort, focus, and courage."In recent weeks, several colleges have witnessed a surge in anti-Israel protests by pro-Palestinian students and student groups.In subsequent communications with the student residents, Nee, representing herself and other leaders in the residence hall, expressed remorse for any harm caused by their previous communication. Nee's email, which was later obtained by Novak, addressed the situation as follows:"Hello all, I would like to address the email that was sent last night on behalf of the Munger HP and 4 Munger RAs," Nee wrote in the email, which was later obtained by Novak. "We regret any harm our words have caused to our residents, parents, alumni, or others in the community. "We are also truly sorry if it has dissuaded anyone from coming to us as RAs or an HP. We overstepped our roles as reslife staff in making this statement and apologize for that."The views expressed do not reflect the views of Paula Queenan (our CD), Cathy Bickel, the Office of Residential Life and Student Housing, Wellesley administration, the Munger community as a whole, or anyone else in the college," Nee added. "We want our residents to know that while we never intended so, we understand how making this statement has caused hurt to specific populations in our community."We as a staff are committed to rebuilding trust and repairing relationships in the Munger community," she added. "If anybody has felt affected by the message sent last night, please feel free to reach out to us to talk. We hope to hold a community space for Munger residents soon regarding this issue. All my best, Moi"In recent times, a number of colleges have observed an increase in protests related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by pro-Palestinian students and student organizations.(Via Fox News Digital) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Hindutva and Zionism have parallels: Yechury

Kochi: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu share a reactionary ideology which is not only against minorities but all people in general. Hindutva and Zionism have parallels. Both endorse killing Muslim minorities. They also try to pass off mythology as history, he claimed, while inaugurating a meeting organized by CPM's Ernakulam committee to extend solidarity to Palestine on Thursday.
Yechury urged that the UN resolution on boundaries of Israel and Palestine, introduced in 1967, must be followed. It's the only feasible solution to the Israel-Palestine issue. Modi tweeted and expressed solidarity with Israel within hours of Hamas bombing southern Israel. At the same time, it took several days for Modi to comment on Manipur violence, he said while repeating CPM's stand on the issue.
Even as Israel continues its counterattack by killing many including kids, Modi hasn't spoken. India hasn't officially taken a stand that Hamas is a terrorist outfit. Mahatma Gandhi also supported the cause of an independent Palestine in 1920. Even 100 days after riots happened in Manipur, Modi didn't visit the state, Yechury said.
Yechury praised Israeli people and the media for standing with the truth. Media exposed fake news that Israel had never bombed hospitals in Gaza strip. According to Israel, it was the missiles of Hamas that fell on the hospitals in Gaza. Hamas has no powerful missile that can completely destroy a hospital. Such weapons are there in the arsenal of Israel only, Yechury alleged.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Monday came under pressure from its Kerala leader Ramesh Chenniathala that it take a line on the Israel-Palestine conflict that underlines the "two state" option, as he expressed resentment that the party had not reflected its traditional stance, endorsing Palestine in its statement earlier.On Sunday, Congress had slammed the "brutal attacks" on Israel and called for a dialogue, even as it endorsed the legitimate aspirations of the people of Palestine. The CWC resolution did not mention the brutality against Israeli citizens, making party's stand contrast clearly with PM Narendra Modi's unequivocal condemnation of "terrorist" attack by Hamas.Chennithala is learnt to have complained that India under Indira Gandhi was very close to the Palestine Liberation Organisation of Yasser Arafat, and the proximity appeared diluted by the statement issued on Sunday. He felt that the party while condemning the attacks on Israel, could have done a balancing job for Palestine.However, sources said a quick discussion ensued to settle the matter. 
Senior Kerala MP Shashi Tharoor and Jairam Ramesh are learnt to have said the proximity to Palestine under the PLO did exist, and the party was still supportive of the Palestine cause. But Hamas, as a militant outfit, could not be put on a par with PLO, and that was the only difference now.As the last paragraph of a two-page resolution, CWC said, "The CWC expresses its dismay and anguish on the war that has broken out in the Middle East where over a thousand people have been killed in the last two days. The CWC reiterates its long-standing support for the rights of the Palestinian people to land, self-government and to live with dignity and respect. The CWC calls for an immediate ceasefire and for negotiations to begin on all outstanding issues including the imperative issues that have given rise to the present conflict."

Group writes to CM after cops deny nod for meeting

Bengaluru: Bengaluru for Justice and Peace, a collective of citizens, through an open letter to chief minister Siddaramaiah, on Friday voiced its disappointment over the actions of the government in clamping down on protests demanding an end to the ongoing conflict in Palestine and advocating peace in the Israel-Palestine region.
The organisation expressed concerns that peaceful protests have been met with denials of permission and even registration of FIRs against protesters. “We strongly believe the reasons furnished by police in their letter rejecting permission for our protest are insufficient and unsubstantiated. We are shocked at the deliberate attempt to silence our voices in support of Palestine, when Congress as well the Centre have issued statements in support of Palestinian people,” the letter to the CM reads.
Pointing out how several other states have allowed rallies of thousands in Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kozhikode, Coimbatore etc., the organisation asked why the Karnataka government was deliberately silencing voices of solidarity with the Palestinian people. 
The letter follows denial of permission by the DCP (west) for holding a public meeting and blood donation camp at Freedom Park to express solidarity with Palestine. The organisation has also written to the DCP to reconsider. In the letter to the CM, it is demanded that he ensure police do not curtail the right to freedom of speech and expression and assembly and grant permission to protest. “...Withdraw FIRs that have been registered against protesters for having exercised their fundamental right to protest,” the letter reads. tnn

Governor has forgotten his duties, pursuing personal agenda, says CM

Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday lashed out at governor Arif Mohammed Khan saying that having forgotten his constitutional duties, he has been pursuing some personal agendas against the state government.
On the governor’s demand that the chief minister should come and brief him about the bills, Vijayan said he had met Khan several times earlier and explained things to him.
“This time, the ministers who had piloted the bills in the assembly met the governor and offered explanations. Who else should go and meet him?” asked the chief minister.
“He is occupying a constitutional position and he has some responsibilities. But he is not performing them. His intention is not just to put the state government in trouble. He has some personal agenda as well,” said Vijayan.
CM Praises Muslim League
Praising the Muslim League for its stand on the Palestine issue, the CM said: “Muslim League is an integral part of the UDF and there is no UDF without the League. Hence, the Muslim League leaders themselves have clarified that when they are part of the front with the Congress, it would not be proper for them to attend an event organized by the CPM.” The country had taken a firm stand on the Palestine issue since Jawaharlal Nehru’s time. Our stand was that we will be always with the people of Palestine. However, the country drifted away from the policy when Narasimha Rao was the prime minister. The country started appeasing Israel since the governments at the Centre wanted to please the US. It has reached its peak now with the country openly declaring its support to Israel, he said.
“But there are certain organizations which have taken an independent stand on the issue and the IUML is one among them. They have openly said that they stand with the Palestinian people. Since we support the people there it does not mean that we are supporting terrorism,” said Vijayan. He also flayed the Congress for seeking an explanation from Aryadan Shoukath for organizing a pro-Palestine rally in Malappuram. “It shows the true colour of the Congress,” he said.
Aadimam Controversy
Vijayan brushed away the controversy over showcasing the tribespeople in the Adimam exhibition organized as part of the Keraleeyam programme. The tribespeople were not showcased. What happened was the presentation of ritual arts. What is wrong with tribal groups performing ritual art on the model of their forefathers, he asked.

Israel-Hamas ceasefire: Hostage exchange brings temporary respite after weeks of war

NEW DELHI: After weeks of intense fighting, Israel and Hamas have finally agreed to a temporary ceasefire from Friday to facilitate the release of dozens of hostages who were abducted during the militant group's unprecedented raids last month. Why it matters: The four-day truce, which was brokered by Qatar, US and Egypt, brings a glimmer of hope not only to the war-weary Palestinians in Gaza but also to the anxious families of the captives awaiting their return.? As part of the ceasefire conditions, Israeli jets and troops will halt their operations during the hostage exchange period.?
 Hamas militants are also expected to stop rocket attacks on Israel.? Hamas has claimed that Israel will also halt flights over southern Gaza during the truce.?  Over 13,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7 while Hamas has abducted around 240 people and killed at least 1,200.Humanitarian pause: The hostage exchange will offer some relief to civilians on either side of the conflict. It will also help de-escalate some tensions between Israel and Hamas following weeks of indirect negotiations. The ceasefire also promises an increase in humanitarian aid and fuel supplies to Gaza, addressing the dire shortages exacerbated by the conflict. ? The release process will occur in multiple stages during the ceasefire. ? Under the negotiations, Israel will release Palestinian prisoners, including women and minors. Hamas will release 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners.? Many hostages, including foreign nationals, may remain in captivity. Families not included in the deal will likely continue advocating for their release.Future course: Over the next four days, the war-torn region will witness a brief period of calm. The agreement also opens a window for strategic shifts and further negotiations, potentially influencing the future course of this long-standing conflict that began on October 7.? Once the ceasefire ends,Israeli troops will maintain their positions in northern Gaza.? The hostilities between Israel and Hamas are expected to resume on Tuesday, unless the period is extended. ? Hamas leader Yehya Sinwar might extend the cease-fire by offering to release more hostages.? Hamas, meanwhile, may use the time to strategize and potentially increase demands.

What is Islamic Jihad, the group being blamed by Israel for bombing at Gaza hospital?

An explosion tore through a Gaza hospital late Tuesday, claiming the lives of at least 500 people. The incident triggered worldwide condemnation and led to violent protests in multiple Muslim nations. The blame for the tragedy was exchanged between Israel and Palestinians. US President Joe Biden, en route to the Middle East, expressed his profound sorrow and outrage over the incident. 
Biden has also cancelled his trip to Jordan.Hamas authorities in Gaza said that the explosion at the Ahli Arab Hospital was the result of the latest Israeli airstrikes. However, the Israeli Defense Forces pointed fingers at Palestinian militants, contending that an outgoing Islamic Jihad rocket had misfired.Here is all you need to know about Islamic Jihad:Islamic Jihad is a Palestinian Islamist militant group that was formed in 1981 as a splinter of the Muslim Brotherhood. It is one of the factions that opposes the peace process with Israel and seeks to establish an Islamic state in Palestine. It is also allied with Hamas, the dominant force in Gaza, and receives support from Iran and Syria. Here is a brief overview of the group and its role in the conflict:History and ideologyIslamic Jihad was founded by Fathi Shaqaqi, a Palestinian doctor who was inspired by the Iranian revolution and the writings of Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian Islamist thinker. Shaqaqi believed that armed struggle was the only way to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation and to create an Islamic society based on Sharia law. He also rejected any political compromise or negotiation with Israel, considering it a usurper of Muslim lands. Shaqaqi was assassinated by Israeli agents in Malta in 1995, and was succeeded by Ramadan Shalah, who led the group until 2018, when he was replaced by Ziyad al-Nakhalah. Islamic Jihad is considered more radical and less pragmatic than Hamas, and has often clashed with the Palestinian Authority over its security cooperation with Israel.Activities and tacticsIslamic Jihad is mainly active in the Gaza Strip, where it has a strong presence in refugee camps and poor neighborhoods. It also operates in the West Bank, but to a lesser extent. The group's armed wing is called Al-Quds Brigades, which means Jerusalem Brigades. It is responsible for carrying out attacks against Israeli military and civilian targets, such as suicide bombings, rocket fire, shootings, and stabbings. Islamic Jihad has also been involved in several wars with Israel, such as the 2008-2009 Gaza War, the 2012 Gaza War, and the 2014 Gaza War. In these conflicts, Islamic Jihad has coordinated with Hamas and other factions to launch rockets and mortars at Israeli towns and cities, as well as to infiltrate Israeli territory through tunnels and ambushes. Islamic Jihad claims that its attacks are a response to Israeli aggression and oppression, and that it is defending the rights and dignity of the Palestinian people.Relations with other actorsIslamic Jihad is part of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, a coalition of factions that reject the Oslo Accords and advocate for armed resistance against Israel. It is also a member of the Axis of Resistance, a regional alliance that includes Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Islamic Jihad has received financial, military, and political support from Iran, which considers it a proxy force against Israel. Iran has also mediated between Islamic Jihad and Hamas when tensions have arisen between them over issues such as strategy, governance, and resources. Islamic Jihad has maintained close ties with Syria, which hosts its political headquarters in Damascus. Islamic Jihad has also expressed solidarity with other Islamist groups in the region, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, al-Qaeda in Yemen, and the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Will Palestine authorities pay Hamas terrorists' families?

NEW DELHI: Growing concerns exist among Israelis and some Palestinians regarding a contentious law designed to provide compensation to the families of Palestinians involved in "nationalistic attacks" against Israelis, according to a Fox News report.Under this law, the Palestinian Authority may be obligated to allocate nearly $3 million each month to the families of hundreds of individuals associated with Hamas who were involved in the deadly incident against Israel on October 7.Israeli organization Palestinian Media Watch, which focuses on highlighting Palestinian extremism, including within its leadership, suggested in an article posted on its website that the Palestinian Authority, the governing body for Palestinians in the West Bank, could now be compelled to provide financial support to the families of the deceased terrorists and those currently in Israeli custody.Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, told Fox News Digital."The Palestinian Authority pays salaries to every single terrorist and to anyone who is arrested fighting Israel," The Palestinian Authority's payments, often referred to as "pay for slay," have been consistently supported by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his government. These payments apply to any Palestinian who is considered a martyr, regardless of their affiliation, including individuals associated with Hamas and Islamic Jihad.Marcus added, "The Palestinian Authority has been adamant about paying these salaries." He also said that these payments persist even as the Palestinian Authority has had to reduce salaries for all government employees due to an economic crisis in the Palestinian territories, leading to protests.According to Lt. 
Col. (res) Shaul Bartal, a senior researcher at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv, it seems improbable that the Palestinian Authority would be able to secure the necessary funds to extend this policy to the families of such a significant number of terrorists. He said, "Right now, the PA does not have the money to pay them even if they wanted to, and Abbas has already said that what Hamas did does not represent the Palestinian people." However, Itamar Marcus did say that Gaza residents demanded compensation from the Palestinian Authority after the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas which resulted in a large number of Palestinians terrorists killed.Abbas and the Palestinian Authority have faced strong criticism for these payments, which consist of an initial bonus in the first month followed by a monthly stipend that progressively increases over time.Bassem Eid, a Palestinian human rights activist and political analyst, told Fox News digital, "In my opinion, the Palestinian Authority is using this policy to encourage more terror against Jews and Israelis. The international community knows this money is going to terror via the Palestinian Authority, but they continue to accept it."Eid, however, did express his doubts that Abbas would "allocate funds to support Hamas militants" in the wake of this month's attack. He suggested that it was more probable for Hamas to directly reward its own fighters. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

New Delhi: In Israeli air strikes, at least 770 Palestinians have lost their lives and 4,000 were injured since Saturday, Gaza's Health Ministry said on Tuesday.The ministry further added that another 18 people were killed and 100 injured in the West Bank since Saturday, according to Reuters.Earlier today, Israel said it had reclaimed control of the Gaza border, pounding the enclave with the fiercest air strikes in the 75-year history of its conflict with the Palestinians despite a Hamas threat to execute a captive for each home hit.Israel has vowed to take its "mighty revenge" since gunmen rampaged through its towns, leaving streets strewn with bodies in by far the deadliest attack in its history. It has called up hundreds of thousands of reservists and placed the Gaza Strip, crowded home to 2.3 million people, under a total siege.After the weekend attacks by the Hamas terrorists, Israel continued its retaliatory strikes on Palestinian-held territory in the Gaza Strip.The United Nations said 180,000 Gazans had been made homeless, many huddling on streets or in schools. 
Smoke and flames rose into the morning sky, while bombardment of the roads often made it impossible for emergency crews to reach the scene of strikes.At the morgue in Gaza's Khan Younis hospital, bodies were laid on the ground on stretchers with their names written on their bellies. Medics called for relatives to pick up bodies quickly because there was no more space for the dead, as per Reuters.There were heavy casualties in a former municipal building struck while being used as an emergency shelter for displaced families.

Hamas-Israel conflict: 'In China, social media is bursting with support for Palestine'

Amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, Chinese social media users have come out in support of Palestine. On Weibo, which boasts nearly 600 million users, a wave of antisemitism and anger towards Israel has emerged, the Business Insider reported quoting posts on Weibo. While Weibo is heavily moderated and may not accurately represent the consensus in China, it offers insight into the narratives and sentiments permitted in the country's digital spaces.Some commenters drew comparisons between Israel and Japan, a country disliked in China due to its actions during World War II. 
Others went so far as to accuse Israel of being a Nazi state.Many commenters also invoked the memory of Du Zhaoyu, a 34-year-old Chinese lieutenant colonel who was killed in a 2006 Israeli air raid while on a peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.Officially, China has called for calm as Hamas launched a significant attack on Israel, prompting Israel to respond with airstrikes and a siege of Gaza.Among the numerous posts and derisive comments, a frequently reposted message suggests that some of the anti-Israel sentiment may be directed at the United States: "Emotionally: sympathy for the Palestinian people. Position: understanding Israel. Politically: disliking the United States. Fundamentally: longing for peace. Conclusion: opposing war means opposing the United States."As in the rest of the world, discussions about the Israel-Palestine conflict have surged on Weibo. The three most popular hashtags related to the conflict have collectively garnered over 1 billion views, according to Insider.On the most prominent posts, support for Palestine is evident. One top comment on a report by the state media agency Xinhua states, "Normal people will support Palestine. It's evident that Palestine is fighting for survival. It is almost at the end of the line."Undercurrents of animosity toward the United States appear in nearly every discussion of the conflict."America, Britain, Israel. The Earth's three major troublemakers. Without these three nations, the world would be much more peaceful," wrote blogger Wenxiao Vincent in a post about a Shanghai woman in Tel Aviv during the Hamas attacks.Renowned columnist Hu Xijin, in his commentary on the Israeli siege of Gaza, pointed out that former US ambassador Nikki Haley, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination, had urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to "finish them" in an October 7 post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Hu accused Haley of making a post "full of murderous intent." He was formerly the Chief Editor of the staunchly pro-government outlet, The Global Times.As per the Business Insider report, blaming the US for war is a recurring theme on Weibo, where users perceive Washington as a cabal of Imperialist warmongers with a hand in all global conflicts, aligning with the propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party.

With Gaza ripped apart, activists, action groups from Palestine raise voice for falling agriculture, threatened food security

BATHINDA: The Palestinian food, agricultural communities and environmental groups activists joined hands for an online event on food crisis and environmental issues to give voices to 'Unheard Palestine', after the Israel-Gaza war named it so. The war-induced agricultural crisis has forced activists to raise questions around food/environmental impacts, ceasefire, solidarity.  While this month's olive season should had been a cause for celebration and harvest, the situation on ground presents a different picture with the farmlands being burned, farmers/fishermen being attacked, and inaccessibility to food and water infrastructure. 
“Our communities in Gaza warn that even if they survive Israel’s bombing, they worry that they will die of thirst or starvation” said Yasmeen from Union of Agricultural Work Committees (UAWC). Yasmeen also spoke on the food security situation saying “65% of Gaza’s population was food insecure before October 7. Now the entire population is at risk of starvation. The Israel’s strategy is that it aims to ensure that those who do survive the bombs are condemned to a future without sustenance.” Yasmeen also spoke about ground situation on food and agriculture, where she mentioned...“Just three days ago Israel bombed boats of the fisheries community. The farmers whose land has not been destroyed already, can’t access their land. Agricultural lands, poultry farms, fisheries have all been damaged to the point that they are non-functional.”“There is a systemic attack on trees for their value for the agricultural sector. Israelis know that if they uproot these ancient trees, it is easy to uproot people", said Mariam from Arab Group for the Protection of Nature (APN), independent civil society movement and research group that has been working on food security and agriculture.“Palestinians are being called by many Israeli officials as being ‘beasts, animals, cockroaches - this is something that actually happened to the Jews before the Holocaust occurred. This also happened before the Bosnian genocide. So what you’re seeing now is that we’re not learning through history. We are repeating the same genocide”, she added.Bashar of the Socio-Economic Action Collective speaking on Israeli military aggression in Lebanon said “Israel managed to burn more than 40,000 trees since Oct 7. They threw white phosphorus, they threw other types of bombs and definitely these will have a long term impact on the contamination of soil and water and the whole ecological system.”Lina Isma’il from Palestinian Agroeclogocial Forum (PAF), which through youth-led agricultural cooperatives and development of local markets, support communities in reclaiming their culture and connection to land raised voice for marginalised communities.Bashar Abu Saifan and Sara Salloum, who represent Socio Economic Action Collective (SEAC), Agricultural Movement in Lebanon, who work to secure the rights of farmers, and strengthen the socio-economic empowerment of agricultural communities also spoke about how agriculture and food security is in grave danger.UAWC, a grassroots civil society organization, founded by agronomists, works in Gaza and the West Bank to rehabilitate lands destroyed by the occupation. It aims to preserve native seeds, support farming co-operatives, and also train farmers in agroecology. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Rift among US Jews widen over Israel-Gaza war

NEW DELHI: Across the US, some Jews are having a mixed bag of emotions as they grapple with the escalating war in Israel and Gaza. Within the Jewish community, one can see a reflecting broader divisions in public opinion over the war.Such a dilemma was seen in Jackie Goldman, who grew up in a conservative Jewish household and attended a Jewish private school as a child, as he was taken aback following Hamas’s attacks in southern Israel on October 7, according to the Guardian. Goldman wanted to grieve Israeli and Palestinian deaths alike and was stunned by what the community felt was a lack of empathy for Palestinian casualties on the part of their congregation. 
In the synagogue listserv, members characterized protests in solidarity with Palestine as violently antisemitic. Meanwhile, a fundraising effort for the Israeli Defense Force garnered widespread support.With a heavy heart, Goldman left the congregation. “What now? What am I going to do for Jewish holidays in the future?” they lamented.The Israel and Palestine war is not a new, maybe not an escalated one, for the Jewish population, who were staying in the US and constituting the world’s second-largest Jewish population after Israel. Even before the October 7 surprise attack, the support for Israel was shifting. According to a poll, most Jews see caring about Israel as important to their Jewish identity, and more than half disapprove of the country’s right-wing government. Another found that a quarter of American Jews agree Israel is an “apartheid state”, and one-fifth of those under 40 do not think the Jewish state has a right to exist.These shifts have come with a surge in Jewish organizing on the left, with groups like IfNotNow and Jewish Voice for Peace, which have long condemned Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, at the forefront of calls for a ceasefire and an end to US support of Israel’s war on Gaza. Since the war started, Jewish activists have shut down New York’s Grand Central station and been arrested for actions like occupying the halls of Congress and rallying in front of the home of the Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, who is also Jewish, reported Guardian.Rabbi Anna Levin Rosen, who oversees the University of Chicago’s Hillel Center, says such actions are isolating to Jewish students who feel they leave little space for their grief over violence against Israeli civilians. “That horror … being embraced as a justified form of resistance, felt shocking to so many of us,” Rosen said, pointing to an incident on campus in which a rally in support of massacred Israelis was drowned out by a protest led by Students for Justice in Palestine.“It feels even more lonely when even Jews don’t see the right for Israelis to live in peace in our homeland,” Rosen said, emphasizing that she holds an “open heart” for Jews whose primary concern is for civilians in Gaza.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin's key ally is ready to join Hamas terrorists against Israel and appealed international community to find a "peaceful solution."Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov on Monday wrote a post on his Telegram channel saying he would happily provide "peacekeeping forces" in "support of Palestine" if needed, Daily Star reported. He wrote: "I appeal to the international community so that at least once they unanimously make a fair decision regarding the situation in Palestine."Through his Telegram Channel, he also appealed to the leaders of Muslim countries to create a coalition and call on those whom you call friends, Europe and the entire West, so that they do not bomb civilians under the pretext of destroying militants. "We support Palestine, and we are against this war, which, unlike other conflicts, can develop into something more," Kadyrov said."I myself have been to Israel, and our peaceful delegation experienced first-hand attempts at overt provocation. 
Therefore, I call for a stop to both the war and any form of escalation of the situation - if necessary, our units are ready to act as peacekeeping forces to restore order and counter any troublemakers."So far, no international leaders have responded to the offer from the warlord. More than 10 Brits are now feared to be "dead or missing" in Israel as a result of the terror attack onslaught from the Hamas terror group, reported Daily Star.Earlier today, the Russian President said the explosion of violence between Israel and the Palestinians showed the failure of US policy in the Middle East, and the Kremlin said it was in touch with both the warring sides.Putin's spokesman said Moscow would seek to play a role in resolving the conflict but did not specify how. Instead, Putin took the opportunity to blame the sharp escalation on years of US policy in the region."I think that many people will agree with me that this is a vivid example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East," Putin told visiting Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani.Putin said the United States had sought to "monopolise" international efforts at forging peace, and accused Washington of neglecting to seek compromises that would be acceptable to both sides, as per Reuters.

How IDF's secret Unit 504 helped in 'uncovering' Hamas network under Gaza hospitals

NEW DELHI: Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza to eradicate Hamas and uproot its infrastructure have recently focussed on hospitals in the Strip mainly due to information recovered by agents of the Israel Defense Forces' secret Unit 504.Days after Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, was declared a 'dead zone' following an operation by Israeli forces, another hospital in the Strip was struck by an Israeli missile killing at least 12 people on Monday.The shift in focus of military operations has been in part due to information uncovered by Unit 504.What is Unit 504?IDF Unit 504 is the military’s human spy network and Israel claims it has been vital in "unmasking Hamas’ abuse of hospitals for a variety of terrorist and military purposes", reported The Jerusalem Post.According to experts, Unit 504’s goals tend to be less big-picture strategic than the Mossad (intelligence agency) and the Shin Bet (security agency, and they pertain more to ongoing military operations.The unit had been mainly focussing on Lebanon but it now fully dedicated to Gaza. It has reestablished a new physical center and unit to handle Gaza issues and security issues on Israel’s southern border, after a hiatus dating back more than a decade.How Unit 504 is helping military opsUnit 504 has doubled its size since the Israel-Gaza war started on October 7, including with some of the most highly trained reservists in the IDF.It has been questioning many arrested Palestinian fighters in an effort to help troops in their operations. 
The IDF said Unit 504 has interrogated over 500 fighters since October 7 and arrested and questioned at least 300 fighters since the start of the Gaza counter-invasion.In a recording released by the IDF of a Unit 504 interrogation, a Palestinian who had been in Al-Shifa Hospital said there were many Hamas forces there, and their presence upset the medical staff. The interrogated Palestinian estimated that he had seen 80 to 100 terrorists there. Another Palestinian told Unit 504 about how Hamas terrorists were using 50,000 Palestinian civilians at the large Palestine Red Crescent Society building in Gaza as human shields, said The Jerusalem Post.Hamas wrapped their rockets in civilian blankets to hide them from the IDF and they frequently fired them from the nearby surroundings of the building, the Palestinian told the IDF.Another Palestinian told Unit 504 he had seen more than 100 Hamas terrorists controlling Rantisi Hospital in Gaza, split up into tents of about five to six terrorists per tent. He said he was also in a hospital known as the Sweden Hospital, where he saw at least seven Hamas terrorists. Although they were in civilian garb, he said he knew one of them personally, and the rest were armed.Uncovering tunnel networkUnit 504 has helped flag some 300 terrorist sites for IDF operations, with more than 100 of them having later been attacked by various Israeli forces.Unit 504’s field interrogation personnel are not just bringing back terrorists to Israel for questioning; they are also questioning terrorists in the field in real time to assist IDF forces with their immediate battle maneuvers and to find Hamas’s sensitive locations on nearby Gaza streets.Besides these interrogated detainees giving Unit 504 questioners information about sensitive terrorist locations in general, they have also been especially helpful in locating Hamas’s tunnel network, the method of operation of the enemy, and detecting how and when Hamas has tried to fade into civilian locations or into the civilian population, the IDF said.In addition, Unit 504’s technological team developed a 360-degree, virtual-reality device to help soldiers see and feel what it is like in battle areas of Gaza at street level. The VR program is based on real videos taken by spies in Gaza who are working on behalf of Unit 504. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

ANKARA: Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan held calls on Saturday with his regional counterparts to discuss the fighting between Israel and Palestinians, a foreign ministry source said, as Ankara said it stood ready to help de-escalate the situation.The source said Fidan discussed the conflict with his Saudi, Qatari, Iranian, Palestinian and Egyptian counterparts, but did not provide any further details.Earlier, Turkey's foreign ministry repeated President Tayyip Erdogan's call for restraint and strongly condemned the loss of civilian lives in the conflict."We emphasize that acts of violence and escalation linked to these benefit nobody," the ministry said. It also urged citizens in the region to remain in secure, indoor locations."Turkey is always ready to provide any help it can to ensure that the developments in question do not escalate further and get taken under control without spreading to a wider region," it added. "In this regard, we continue our intensive contacts with the relevant parties."The conflict comes as Turkey, which has backed Palestinians in the past and supported a two-state solution to the conflict, works to normalise ties with Israel after years of animosity.The former allies mutually expelled ambassadors in 2018 and have often traded barbs on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
But a regional charm offensive launched by Ankara in 2020 prompted a thaw and subsequently led to the re-appointment of envoys.Israel had also long complained of Ankara's hosting of leaders of Hamas, which Turkey does not view as a terrorist group.Prior to Saturday's violence, Erdogan had said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may visit Turkey in October-November to discuss cooperation on energy, while Turkey's energy minister said he planned to visit Israel in November.

NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden may visit Israel sometime this week amid growing fears that a looming Israeli move into Gaza could spark a wider war in the Middle East with devastating humanitarian consequences.On Monday, Biden postponed a planned trip to Colorado to stay in Washington and focus on the growing conflict in the Arab region, sparking rumours that he may fly out to Israel in a powerful symbol of support for Tel Aviv following the October 7 attack by Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people, including at least 30 US citizens.According to several media reports, US and Israeli officials are discussing the possibility of Biden visiting Tel Aviv as early as Wednesday at the invitation of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even as the Israeli military continues to bombard Gaza and is in the final steps of launching a massive ground offensive. The Israeli bombardment of Gaza, which has been going on for over a week now, has already killed at least 2,750 Palestinians.Iran and other Arab nations have been bristling at the Israeli offensive and forced evacuation of nearly a million Palestinians from northern Gaza, and may see Biden's presence in Israel as a provocative move amid mounting crisis in Gaza.Blinken returns to Israel US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has already been travelling around the Middle East this past week trying to prevent the war with Hamas from igniting a broader regional conflict.Blinken is thought to have heard criticism of Israel's military operations from Egypt's president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. 
After Cairo, he travelled to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar. He also met Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. Egypt's state-run media said el-Sisi told Blinken that Israel's Gaza operation has exceeded "the right of self-defence" and turned into "a collective punishment".Blinken landed on in Israel on Monday, his second visit in less than a week, carrying to Israeli leaders the feedback he received in a rush of meetings with leaders throughout the Arab world.

WhatsApp's AI shows kid with gun when prompted with 'Palestine'

NEW DELHI: A social media platform, WhatsApp introduced an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that lets users generate images based on prompts but recent development amid the Israel-Hamas war proved to be a disturbing one. Recently, WhatsApp's AI feature produced the image of a gun or a boy with a gun when prompted with the terms “Palestinian”, “Palestine” or “Muslim boy Palestinian”, the Guardian reported.And in the case of the Israeli boy prompt, WhatsApp generated cartoons of children playing soccer and reading. For the term "Israeli army," the AI created drawings of soldiers smiling and praying, with no guns involved.The results varied from phone to phone. 
The parent company of WhatsApp, Meta's employees have reported the issue internally, a person with knowledge of the discussions said.Meta-owned WhatsApp allows users to try out its AI image generator to “create a sticker”. The feature prompts users to “turn ideas into stickers with AI”. Guardian searches for “Muslim Palestine”, for instance, surfaced four images of a woman in a hijab: standing still, reading, holding a flower, and holding up a sign. But Guardian searches for “Muslim boy Palestinian” at 4:46pm ET on Thursday generated four images of children: one boy is holding an AK-47-like firearm and wearing a hat commonly worn by Muslim men and boys called a kufi or taqiyah.Another Guardian search for “Palestine” one minute earlier generated an image of a hand holding a gun. Prompted with “Israel” the feature returned the Israeli flag and a man dancing. The prompt of “Hamas” brought up the message “Couldn’t generate AI stickers. Please try again.”Kevin McAlister, a Meta spokesperson, said the company was aware of the issue and addressing it: “As we said when we launched the feature, the models could return inaccurate or inappropriate outputs as with all generative AI systems. We’ll continue to improve these features as they evolve and more people share their feedback.”Users also documented several instances of Instagram translating “Palestinian” followed by the phrase “Praise be to Allah” in Arabic text to “Palestinian terrorist”. The company apologized for what it described as a “glitch”. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Who is Sven Khn von Burgsdorff, facing flak for paragliding in Gaza?

Sven Khn von Burgsdorff is a German diplomat who formerly served as the European Union envoy to Gaza. He has recently come under intense scrutiny and criticism in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war due to a controversial incident that took place a few months before the conflict escalated.In July, von Burgsdorff was captured on video conducting what he described as "the first Gaza paragliding flight in history." During this flight, he soared over Gaza's coast and was heard shouting, "Free Palestine!"
 In the footage, an enthusiastic von Burgsdorff told Palestinians that once they achieve freedom, they could engage in similar recreational activities.However, the situation took a dark turn when, instead of Palestinians enjoying recreational paragliding as von Burgsdorff had advocated, such gliders were employed by Hamas on October 7 to invade Israel, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,400 Israelis. Following this, Israel declared war on Hamas and initiated a series of airstrikes on Gaza.Von Burgsdorff's response to these events further fueled the controversy. He condemned Israel's actions, saying that it "doesn't matter what Hamas did." He argued against Israel's use of force, suggesting that the acts committed against Israelis were not a valid excuse to "flatten Gaza." His remarks were reported by Israel Hayom, where he was quoted saying, "It cannot be that Israel has carte blanche because terrible acts, cruel and shocking acts happened to 1,000 or even 1,200 Israelis."The video of von Burgsdorff paragliding over Gaza resurfaced amidst the conflict, drawing significant attention and criticism. Israel's foreign ministry labeled the act as "provocative" propaganda, accusing the diplomat of forgetting his representation of the European Union and its member states. Instead, they claimed he was championing the Palestinian narrative and acting as a "propaganda tool in the hands of the terrorist organizations that control Gaza."Further adding to the controversy, a representative for the EU delegation to the Palestinians told Reuters that the paraglider used in the stunt was personally owned by von Burgsdorff. Although he left his post in Gaza in August, von Burgsdorff has remained vocal in his opposition to Israel's actions in the Palestinian territory, especially concerning its airstrikes.In a radio interview, von Burgsdorff expressed his concerns over the high Palestinian death toll since October 7, emphasizing that nothing justified the use of such deadly force without distinction and proportionality concerning the Palestinian population in Gaza. He also warned against Israel's potential bombing of corridors and shipments carrying humanitarian equipment, labeling it a potential war crime.However, von Burgsdorff faced criticism for not condemning Hamas' attack on Israel, which targeted hundreds of innocent civilians, including women and children.

During a demonstration in New York City, anti-Israel protesters engaged in a series of provocative actions, including setting an Israeli flag on fire and splattering fake blood on the New York Times building. The protest, organised by the organization Within Our Lifetime and part of the "Flood Manhattan for Gaza" movement, began at Columbus Circle, where demonstrators ignited the flag and confronted a small group of Israel supporters.According to a report in the New York Post, the protesters, who were calling for the elimination of the Jewish state, chanted slogans such as “We don’t want a Jewish state. We want ‘48!
” referring to Palestine before the establishment of Israel. They also shouted, “Settlers, settlers go back home! Palestine is ours alone!” and “It is right to rebel. Israel, go to Hell!”The demonstration then moved through Manhattan, with protesters placing stickers with messages like “Zionism is terrorism,” and “Israel is committing genocide in Gaza!” on storefronts, including the Dior store on 5th Avenue. They also projected messages such as “Palestine will be free,” and “Cease apartheid” on the Museum of Modern Art building.As the protest reached the New York Times building, demonstrators splattered fake blood on its entrance, chanting “F–k New York Times!” and accusing the media outlet of Zionist bias. The group then continued to Grand Central Terminal, where they attempted to force their way inside, leading to a confrontation with the police.The NYPD surrounded the terminal and ordered the crowd to disperse. The entrances to Grand Central were closed due to the demonstration. This protest follows a similar event last month, where over 300 people were arrested during a pro-Palestinian demonstration that shut down the train station.The NYPD has not immediately confirmed any arrests during this latest march. The actions of the protesters and their confrontations with both Israel supporters and law enforcement highlight the ongoing tensions and complex dynamics surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

History of Israel-Palestinian conflict: The origin of wars explained

NEW DELHI: Savage acts of violence, widespread abductions and families torn apart. The harrowing impact of the recent escalation between Israel and Hamas militants has left the global community in disbelief. Yet, the longstanding tensions between the two sides stretch back over decades.A brief history of Palestine & IsraelPrior to World War I, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, home to Arab Muslims, Arab Christians and Jewish communities. After World War I, the League of Nations mandated Britain to govern Palestine.This led to an increase in Jewish immigration, which fueled tensions between Jewish settlers and the Arab Palestinian population. 
Eventually, due to challenges in governing colonies after the war, Palestine was handed over to the United Nations. The Balfour Declaration of 1917 expressed support for a Jewish national home in Palestine.In 1947, the United Nations partition plan recommended separate Jewish and Arab states, accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by Arab leaders. This set the stage for the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and the establishment of Israel, which continues to impact the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and regional dynamics even today.Arab-Israel warThe 1948 Arab-Israel war began when Israel declared statehood on May 14, 1948, leading to an invasion by neighboring Arab states. It resulted in Israel's survival and the signing of armistice agreements in 1949, with territorial changes.The 1956 Suez Crisis saw Israel, along with France and the UK, launching a military campaign against Egypt over the nationalization of the Suez Canal. Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip but withdrew under international pressure in 1957.In the 1967 Six-Day war, Israel swiftly gained territory, including the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights, reshaping the Middle East's geopolitical landscape.The 1973 Yom Kippur war, also known as the October war, began with a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria on Israel during Yom Kippur - the holiest and most solemn day in the Jewish calendar. The conflict led to intense fighting, some territorial changes, and set the stage for subsequent peace negotiations, including the Camp David Accords in 1978.Armistice agreements in 1949 established temporary borders between Israel and neighboring Arab states. The West Bank was controlled by Jordan, and Egypt administered the Gaza Strip, leaving Palestinian territories in political limbo for years. Palestine liberation organisationThe PLO was established in 1964 after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war left Palestinians without an independent state. The organization was founded during the first Palestinian National Congress in East Jerusalem. Early efforts included diplomacy for international recognition and the creation of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) for armed resistance against Israel.At the time, the West Bank was under Jordanian control, and Gaza was administered by Egypt.The PLO, formed in 1964, aimed to represent Palestinians and work toward their national aspirations, including self-determination and a Palestinian state. Ahmed Shukairi was its first chairman, and the PLO adopted the Palestine National Covenant as its core document.Shift towards armed struggleIn the late 1960s, the PLO shifted its strategy from diplomacy to armed struggle, influenced by global liberation movements. Fatah, led by Yasser Arafat, became the prominent faction driving this change.Throughout the 1970s, the PLO carried out armed actions, including airplane hijackings and attacks on Israeli targets. Yasser Arafat's historic 1974 UN General Assembly address marked international recognition. In the 1980s, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 led to PLO forces' expulsion from Beirut, but the organization continued efforts to gain international support.The IntifadasAn Intifada, means "uprising" or "shaking off" in Arabic, refers to a sustained period of Palestinian resistance and protest against Israeli occupation and policies.The Intifadas were Palestinian uprisings against Israeli occupation. The First Intifada (1987-1993) used civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance, leading to international sympathy and recognition. It contributed to the Oslo Accords.The Second Intifada, or Al-Aqsa Intifada (2000-2005), began after former PM of Israel, Ariel Sharon's visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. It involved violent acts like suicide bombings and clashes, causing casualties and damage in the West Bank and Gaza. It led to a breakdown in peace negotiations and hardened positions on both sides.The Oslo AccordsIn 1993, the PLO accepted the Oslo Accords, recognizing Israel's right to exist. This led to the creation of Palestinian Authority (PA) to govern parts of the West Bank and Gaza. The PLO continued peace negotiations, dealt with internal issues, and transitioned from diplomacy to armed resistance. This history underscores the enduring Palestinian struggle for statehood and the organization's central role in representing Palestinian interests on the global stage.The Oslo Accords were seen as a significant effort to address the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Negotiated secretly in Oslo, Norway, these accords aimed to establish peace amid decades of violence, occupation and distrust.While the Oslo Accords brought hope for peace, they encountered challenges marred by violence and mistrust, resulting in recurring assassinations, bombings, and clashes.Subsequent agreements, like the 1995 Oslo II Accords, clarified administrative zones in the West Bank but also intensified tensions, especially regarding Israeli settlements. While the accords facilitated limited Palestinian self-governance, they left core issues like borders and Jerusalem unresolved. The conflict continued with intermittent violence and stalled negotiations, emphasizing the complexity and deeply rooted nature of the Israeli-Palestinian struggle.Thus, a lasting solution remained elusive.Recent Israel-Palestine conflictOn October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a multi-front assault on Israeli cities, firing an unprecedented number of rockets within a 24-hour period, marking the largest such attack since the 2014 Gaza war.Israel responded with airstrikes targeting Hamas military positions and infrastructure in Gaza, resulting in escalating conflict between the two sides, with numerous rockets fired at southern and central Israel, including major cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.Thousands of people have been killed and countless wounded in the latest escalation between both sides.Most countries, including the US and India, have outrightly condemned the terrorist attacks by Hamas. However, some have also blamed Israel for the conflict. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

US campuses grappling with violence and threats amid Israel-Hamas conflict

Amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, American campuses are grappling with challenges related to student safety, identity-based tensions, and the balance between open scholarship and activism, reported Independent. Incidents ranging from protest melees to death threats have erupted across US universities.In a recent viral video from Cooper Union College, Jewish students found themselves locked inside a library as pro-Palestine demonstrators chanted outside. The clash unfolded after pro-Israel students initially joined a counter-protest, leading to heightened tensions.Instances of violence and threats have escalated. 
A Cornell University junior, Patrick Dai, was arrested for allegedly making violent threats against the school's Jewish population. Similar incidents, including an assault at Columbia University, reflect a troubling rise in antisemitic and anti-Muslim incidents.The Anti-Defamation League reports a 400% increase in antisemitic incidents in the US since the conflict's onset. The FBI attributes about 60% of all religious-based hate crimes to antisemitic acts, emphasizing the severity of the situation.The White House is actively involved, collaborating with the Department of Justice and Homeland Security to address hate-related campus threats. Universities, including Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania, are convening to counter antisemitism in higher education.However, concerns arise over limitations on free speech and campus activism. Recent incidents, such as the questioning of students at Bloomfield Hills High School, suggest challenges in navigating the fine line between expression and perceived threats. The slogan "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free" has sparked controversy, with some seeing it as a direct threat, leading to demands for student expulsions.Pro-Palestinian groups, such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), face scrutiny and closures at Florida universities. Columbia University suspended SJP and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), citing policy violations and unapproved events with threatening rhetoric.The tensions extend beyond campuses, with political and financial consequences. Individuals expressing views critical of Israel face doxxing and career repercussions. The wider debate over academic freedom intensifies as calls to remove professors, like Joseph Massad at Columbia University, raise concerns about stifling essential discussions.In this charged atmosphere, finding a constructive dialogue becomes crucial, not only for the well-being of students and academics but also for addressing broader geopolitical concerns, given the US's role as Israel's key security ally.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's representative at the United Nations on Monday ignored the loss of lives in Israel after the deadly invasion by Hamas even as he called for a moment of silence for the Palestinians who died from the retaliatory Israeli attacks.Ambassador Zaman Mehdi, Pakistan's deputy permanent representative to the UN, was seen in a post on X pointing out the tragic loss of lives and ongoing violence as a reminder of over seven decades of "illegal foreign occupation, aggression, and disregard for international law, including UNESCO resolutions".He then led a moment of silence at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in the memory of the "innocent lives" lost in the "occupied Palestinian territory and elsewhere", with no mention of Israeli victims.According to a report in the New York Post, the Pakistan ambassador said that the 16-year-long blockade of Gaza was illegal and expressed concerns that efforts to normalize the situation were inadvertently fueling violence."In this context, the so-called declaration of war and attacks on civilian population and their properties is deeply distressing," he said, referring to Israeli cabinet's decision to declare war after Saturday morning's multi-front attacks.Notably, Pakistan has been expressing solidarity with Palestine amid the violence fomented by the militant group Hamas.On Sunday, Pakistan's caretaker foreign minister Jalil Abbas Jilani said he was "deeply concerned" regarding the increasing hostilities in the Middle East and urged Israel to promptly halt its actions of oppression in occupied Palestine.

A former European Union envoy to Gaza is facing criticism for allegedly empowering Hamas to experiment with paragliders, the New York Post reported.Sven Khn von Burgsdorff, a German diplomat, created a video in July where he claimed to be conducting the "first Gaza paragliding flight in history." During the flight over Gaza's coast, he shouted, "Free Palestine!"
 and said they could do the same once they achieve freedom.Burgsdorff condemned Israel for responding to Hamas saying that it "doesn't matter what Hamas did , It cannot be that Israel has carte blanche because terrible acts, cruel and shocking acts happened to 1,000 or even 1,200 Israelis. . This is not the excuse you can use to flatten Gaza."A representative for the EU delegation to the Palestinians confirmed that the paraglider used in the stunt belonged to von Burgsdorff. Reportedly, while von Burgsdorff left his post in Gaza in August, he has continued to express his opposition to Israel's actions in the Palestinian territory, particularly its airstrikes.Regarding the situation, with over 4,700 Palestinians killed since October 7, von Burgsdorff emphasized in a radio interview that there was no justification for "the use of such deadly force without distinction and proportionality concerning the Palestinian population in Gaza.""It cannot be that Israel is threatening to bomb corridors and shipments carrying humanitarian equipment. It cannot be. It is another war crime if it happens," he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Former Israeli PM Bennett gets into heated exchange with news anchor over Gaza crisis

In a heated clash, Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett engaged in a debate with MSNBC host Katy Tur and the international community on Monday regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict's history, reported Fox News. As Israel responded to the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks with military strikes and a ground invasion of Gaza, the international community expressed objections, claiming Israel's methods were disproportionate and genocidal, a critique that raised concerns among many Israelis.Katy Tur expressed her sorrow over the plight of children and the overall violence resulting from the October 7 attack, before questioning Bennett, "But I’m sure that there are Palestinians who can show images of their own children who have tragically perished in this conflict. Many in the world are calling for a ceasefire. 
Several allies are advocating for at least a temporary pause, if not a ceasefire through a U.N. vote. Why do you think so much of the world is urging Israel to halt its actions?"Bennett admitted that he did not have a clear answer but suggested that Israel was being held to a different standard. He offered a hypothetical scenario, saying, "Imagine if America, instead of Mexico, had a state of Al-Qaeda, with 240 American hostages, including babies, there, and this Al-Qaeda state entered Florida and committed heinous acts. Would anyone ask America to cease fire against this Al-Qaeda state?"Highlighting the history of Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and Hamas' subsequent takeover after elections, Bennett argued that many Israelis had hoped that improving Palestinian lives would reduce tensions. However, he claimed that the opposite had occurred, leading to what he described as a "nightmare." Bennett firmly stated that Israel could no longer tolerate any Hamas presence near its borders.Katy Tur raised the idea of a two-state solution as a potential long-term resolution to the conflict, allowing Gazans to have "everything that a nation enjoys on their land." Bennett rejected this proposal, asserting that it had been attempted previously and had failed. He pointed out, "Until 2005, Israel occupied Gaza. In 2005, we pulled out of Gaza, back to the 1967 borders, and handed the entire territory over to the Palestinian Authority. They had the chance to create the Palestinian state everyone talks about, but instead, they focused on attacking us."Tur countered, implying that the Gaza government's non-state status contributed to the radicalization of Hamas. She argued that Gazans hadn't had a vote in 17 years due to Hamas's control, and the region wasn't connected to the West Bank. Bennett, however, emphasized the realities on the ground, stating, "But that's beside the point. We're talking about Gaza. The West Bank is the West Bank, and Gaza is Gaza. They got everything they wanted. Israelis left and right, there's a consensus; no one wants to experiment with dangerous strategies again." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

The aid aims to assist the people of Palestine during the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.On Saturday, 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid were permitted to enter the Gaza Strip via Egypt's Rafah border, though the World Health Organization Director-General emphasized that further aid is required. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported a healthcare crisis in Gaza, where over 60% of primary care facilities are closed, and hospitals are facing collapse due to shortages of power, medicine, medical equipment, and specialized personnel. The international community is making efforts to provide assistance to alleviate the suffering of the people in Gaza. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'Iran helped Hamas plot devastating attack on Israel'

Iranian security officials collaborated with the Palestinian terror group Hamas to orchestrate its sneak attack on Israel last Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The plan allegedly received final approval at a meeting held in Beirut the previous Monday.The operation, involving air, land, and sea incursions, marked the most significant breach of Israel's borders since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. These plans were developed during meetings in Beirut, where officers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps(IRGC) and representatives from several Iran-backed militant groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah, refined the details, the WSJ report said.Iranian officers, including representatives from Iran-backed militant organizations like Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah, reportedly worked closely with the Gaza-based terrorist group since August to meticulously plan the October 7 attack. 
This assault involved thousands of rockets and armed gunmen crossing the heavily fortified Israeli border, resulting in a death toll exceeding 1,000, making it the most significant breach of Israel's security since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.Meetings in Beirut saw Iranian officers and representatives from Hamas and Hezbollah refining tactical and strategic plans for the attack, according to sources cited by the Wall Street Journal. Experts have asserted that an attack of this magnitude necessitated extensive planning and coordination with Iran. Lina Khatib, the director of the SOAS Middle East Institute at the University of London, emphasized that groups like Hamas do not unilaterally engage in warfare without explicit approval from Iran, drawing parallels with Hezbollah's operations in Lebanon.The overarching plan, as revealed by senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah and an Iranian official, aims to escalate active warfare against Israel on multiple fronts. This strategy involves collaboration with Hezbollah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in the north, as well as Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank.The attack was planned to coincide with Israel's internal political turmoil surrounding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. Additionally, it was orchestrated to disrupt the rapidly progressing US-brokered negotiations aimed at normalizing relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, a development perceived as a threat by Iran, according to senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah, the WSJ report said.While US officials have not found concrete evidence of Iran's involvement, European sources and an adviser to the Syrian government corroborated the account provided by senior Hamas and Hezbollah members. "We have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was behind this particular attack, but there is certainly a long relationship," US secretary of state Antony Blinken told CNN. However, Mahmoud Mirdawi, a senior Hamas official, asserted that the attacks were independently planned by the Palestinian group.If Iran's direct involvement is substantiated, tensions in the already volatile region could escalate further. Despite the Wall Street Journal's attempts to seek comment from the Iranian delegation at the United Nations, there has been no response.Meanwhile, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, expressed support for the attacks on a social media platform, asserting the eventual eradication of the Zionist regime at the hands of the Palestinian people and regional Resistance forces.

Columbia university Alumni urge ban on calls for 'Global Intifada'

Over 500 Columbia University almuni have signed a letter expressing gratitude to the school for suspending two student groups, New York Post reported.  Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, were suspended for violating the university's rules on 'threatening rhetoric and intimidation'. The Students for Justice in Palestine was specifically accused of celebrating a terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7, resulting in over 1,200 people being killed in Israel and almost 240 others being taken hostage.“While debate, advocacy, and protest have always been, and must remain, central to Columbia’s DNA, the recent anti-Israel and pro-Hamas demonstrations display an unacceptable ignorance of historical facts and dangerous ideological militancy,” read the letter sent to the school Monday.“It is truly frightening to watch organizations of students at Columbia University act in ideological lockstep with authoritarian nations, regimes, or their proxies which advocate for violence, deny their citizens human rights and the free expression of ideas, and oppose equal rights for women and the LGBTQ community,” the alumni added.The Columbia University alumni, in expressing their appreciation for the suspension of the groups, have urged the university to prevent similar demonstrations in the future. They highlighted a significant increase in antisemitic incidents in New York City and worldwide following Israel's declaration of war in Gaza, the New York Post report said.According to the NYPD, there were at least 69 anti-Jewish incidents in October, more than three times the previous year's figure.The alumni's letter also raised concerns about statements made by the Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) after its suspension. 
The JVP indicated that it would not retreat from organizing pro-Palestinian rallies on campus, prompting the alumni to issue a warning regarding such comments.“Our actions will be louder than our words. For all those people who are yearning for freedom, and for the media outlets: Keep an on [sic] eye on Columbia,” the JVP said in a statement Saturday.The alumni said that the recent statement by the group served as a "direct threat" to escalate divisions on campus. They urged Columbia University to permanently ban both SJP and JVP. The letter also called on Columbia University president Minouche Shafik to directly condemn the phrase “From the river to the sea,” a chant used by pro-Palestinian protesters that the alumni said “implies the eradication of Jews from Israel.” For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Hamas militants engaged with Israeli forces trying to push into Gaza's largest refugee camp on Sunday and Israeli air strikes to the south, which killed dozens of Palestinians, even as deals on hostage release remain uncertain.Hostage release dealUS mediators were close to a deal between Israel and Hamas to free dozens of women and children held hostage in Gaza in exchange for a five-day pause in their war that would help boost emergency aid shipments to Gaza civilians, according to news reports.But Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and US officials denied the tentative deal, stating ongoing efforts to finalise an agreement, the report claimed.Qatari mediationQatar's prime minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani noted "minor" issues in hostage release talks, mainly practical and logistical, as obstacles to a deal.Hostage crisisHamas took about 240 hostages during its deadly cross-border rampage into Israeli communities on October 7, which prompted Israel to lay siege to Gaza and invade the Palestinian territory to eradicate its ruling Islamist group.US involvementThe White House denies reports of a tentative agreement on a pause in fighting and hostage release. The US official hints at more fuel deliveries and a pause in fighting when hostages are released, according to media reports.President Joe Biden, according to what he wrote in the Washington Post, suggests that Gaza and the West Bank should be reunited under a single, revitalised Palestinian Authority for peace. 
Biden also threatened sanctions against Israeli settlers involved in recent attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank.CasualtiesThe ongoing Israeli campaign, in response to the attacks, has resulted in 12,300 casualties, including over 5,000 children, as reported by the Hamas government in Gaza.Over 30 premature babies were evacuated from Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, as the World Health Organization described it as a "death zone."

Over 100 Harvard faculty members criticise president Gay's stance on pro-Palestine slogan

NEW DELHI: Over 100 faculty members from Harvard University, representing eight different schools, have openly criticized president Claudine Gay's denouncement of the pro-Palestine slogan "from the river to the sea." This criticism was articulated in an open letter addressed to president Gay on Monday.The letter comes amidst increasing campus tensions due to the conflict in Israel and Gaza, coupled with growing demands from university donors for a stronger stance against antisemitism. Last Thursday, President Gay publicly condemned the aforementioned slogan and announced Harvard's plans to collaborate with a newly established antisemitism advisory group to implement training for university affiliates.As per a report in the Harvard Crimson, among the signatories of the letter are notable figures such as former Lowell House Faculty Dean Diana L Eck, Philosophy Department Chair Bernhard Nickel, and History professor Sugata Bose, who previously served in India’s parliament.The letter highlights that the pro-Palestine phrase has a "long and complicated history." 
It argues that labeling the phrase as inherently implying "removalism or even eliminationism" is both "imprudent as a matter of university policy and badly misjudged as an act of moral leadership."The faculty expressed their "profound dismay" at Gay's statement, voicing concerns over its implications for academic freedom. They contend that the university's commitment to intellectual freedom and open dialogue is being overshadowed by a new educational model where meanings of terms are dictated from above, as indicated by the advisory committee's ongoing work.The letter emphasizes that criticism of Israel should not automatically be deemed antisemitic. Jason A. Newton, a university spokesperson, confirmed the receipt of the letter by president Gay but declined to comment further.The faculty urged president Gay to instruct the advisory group to clearly define antisemitism to the university community before recommending any policies that could affect freedom of thought and expression on campus.The letter also refers to comments made by Harvard Chabad president Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi, who criticized the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee for a statement that held Israel responsible for the initial attack, accusing them of "supporting terrorism." The faculty expressed concern that the current delineation of acceptable campus expression is "dangerously one-sided."In his email, Rabbi Zarchi urged Harvard to follow the precedent set by Columbia University and Brandeis University in de-recognizing pro-Palestine student groups. However, the faculty letter advocates against any disciplinary action towards the Palestine Solidarity Committee.Furthermore, the faculty requested that President Gay resist premature sanctions against students and employees based on their political activities without specific allegations of wrongdoing. They also called for the reversal of any sanctions already imposed on affiliates, pending a thorough investigation. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

UNITED NATIONS: India has voted in favour of a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly that condemns Israeli settlement activities in Occupied Palestinian Territory.Canada, Hungary, Israel, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru and the United States voted against the draft resolution titled ‘Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the occupied Syrian Golan'. It was approved by the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) of the UN General Assembly by a recorded vote of 145 in favour, seven against and 18 abstentions on Thursday.India was among the 145 nations that voted in favour of the resolution along with Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, France, Japan, Malaysia, Maldives, Russia, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the UK.By the terms of the resolution, the Assembly would condemn settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan and any activities involving the confiscation of land, the disruption of the livelihood of protected persons, the forced transfer of civilians and the annexation of land, whether de facto or through national legislation.
Follow Israel-Hamas war live updatesThe resolution “Condemns”… “settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan and any activities involving the confiscation of land, the disruption of the livelihood of protected persons, the forced transfer of civilians and the annexation of land, whether de facto or through national legislation.”The resolution “Reaffirms that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an obstacle to peace and economic and social development.”The resolution reiterated “its demand for the immediate and complete cessation of all Israeli settlement activities in all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan.”The voting on the resolution came just days after India had abstained in the UN General Assembly on a resolution that called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict leading to a cessation of hostilities and unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza strip.The 193-member UN General Assembly met in a resumed 10th Emergency Special Session in October and voted on the draft resolution submitted by Jordan and co-sponsored by over 40 nations including Bangladesh, Maldives, Pakistan, Russia and South Africa.The resolution titled ‘Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations' was adopted with 120 nations voting in favour, 14 against and 45 abstentions. Along with India, countries abstaining on the resolution included Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.In its Explanation of Vote after the UNGA resolution last month, India's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Yojna Patel had said “In a world where differences and disputes should be resolved by dialogue, this august body should be deeply concerned at recourse to violence. That too, when it happens on a scale and intensity that is an affront to basic human values.”Describing the terror attacks in Israel on October 7 as shocking, Patel said they deserve condemnation.“Terrorism is a malignancy and knows no borders, nationality or race. The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts. Let us keep aside differences, unite and adopt a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism,” she had said.

Yale's campus newspaper criticized for censoring report on Hamas atrocities against Jews

Yale University's campus newspaper, the Yale Daily News, has come under fire for censoring a pro-Israel columnist by removing what it deemed "unsubstantiated claims that Hamas raped women and beheaded men" from a recent column, reported The New York Post. The controversy has sparked a heated debate on campus and in the wider community about freedom of expression and journalistic integrity.The incident occurred when the Yale Daily News removed references to alleged atrocities committed by Hamas in an opinion piece titled "Is Yalies4Palestine a hate group?" authored by sophomore Sahar Tartak, the editor in chief of the rival campus newspaper, Yale Free Press. 
In response to the censorship, Tartak took to her social media account to express her dismay, and she shared a comment by Yale professor Nicholas Christakis, who questioned the validity of such claims.Tartak's column was published just five days after a Hamas massacre on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,400 Israelis. The attack occurred during a music festival near the Israel-Gaza border fence, where Hamas terrorists infiltrated the area using hang-gliders and pickup trucks. In her article, Tartak condemned the student group Yalies4Palestine, which had posted messages on Instagram blaming Israel for the atrocities.Yalies4Palestine's official Instagram page contained a post immediately following the Hamas attack, holding "the Israeli Zionist regime responsible for the unfolding violence." Another social media post from the group encouraged the Yale community to celebrate "the resistance's success" and expressed full support for the Palestinian people's right to resist colonization while dismissing nonviolent acts of resistance as ineffective.The controversy surrounding the column escalated due to the claims of heinous acts committed by Hamas, such as beheadings and sexual violence against women. Israeli authorities have reported the recovery of beheaded bodies of infants killed by Hamas gunmen who invaded towns along the Gaza Strip's frontier. They also disclosed a handwritten note found on a Hamas terrorist encouraging the removal of heads, hearts, and livers from their Israeli victims.However, the veracity of these claims has been met with skepticism, prompting the Yale Daily News to issue an editor's note on October 25, stating that Tartak's column "has been edited to remove unsubstantiated claims that Hamas raped women and beheaded men."This incident comes amid ongoing tensions in the region, with Israeli President Isaac Herzog confirming the tragic death of Shani Nicole Louk, a German-Israeli tattoo artist kidnapped by Hamas. Her brutal murder, which involved her beheading, has shocked the international community. Israeli military personnel involved in search and rescue operations have reported the discovery of beheaded bodies, including infants, near the Gaza Strip's border.The controversy surrounding the Yale Daily News and the broader debate over the claims in Tartak's column underscore the sensitivity and complexity of the Israel-Palestine conflict and the importance of responsible journalism when covering such issues. Hamas has denied allegations of killing infants and other heinous acts, further complicating the situation and highlighting the need for rigorous investigation and fact-checking in reporting on this conflict.

KOCHI: Former Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal virtually addressed a rally in support of Palestinians organised by a Jamaat-e-Islami Hind-aligned outfit in Kerala's Malappuram on Friday, sparking a row as BJP termed it an "alarming glorification of terrorists" and asked how the Left-governed state allowed it.The organisers - Solidarity Youth Movement (SYM) - dismissed the controversy, asserting in a press note that Hamas is a "resistance movement" and Meshaal a "freedom fighter".Meshaal's pre-recorded video address in Arabic was beamed on a screen at the Youth Resistance Rally, which had the tagline "Uproot Bulldozer Hindutva and Apartheid Zionism". The organisers had announced that another Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, would also virtually address the rally, but he did not.State BJP president K Surendran termed the instance "alarming". "Where is (CM) Pinarayi Vijayan's police? Under the disguise of 'Save Palestine' they are glorifying Hamas, a terrorist organisation and its leaders as 'warriors'. This is unacceptable," Surendran wrote on X while sharing a photo of Meshal's virtual address.The organisers justified Meshaal's virtual presence at the event. "The Palestinian Legislative Council is an influential movement in Gaza and the West Bank. 
The party won 74 of 132 seats in the last election. There is nothing unusual about the leader of such an organisation speaking at a Palestinian solidarity event in Malappuram," SYM state president CT Shuhaib said in a statement."Hamas is not an active or banned organisation in India. So, the presence of a Hamas leader in the event is not against law," the SYM state president said.The SYM functionary alleged a plot to muzzle protests and voices. "Sangh parivar has been conspiring to label those standing with Palestine as terrorists by spreading false propaganda. By doing so, it is trying to suppress the public protests against India's support to Israel," Shuhaib said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Pro-Palestinian demonstrators interrupted US State Secretary Antony Blinken's senate testimony and said, "Shame on you all. The world is calling for a ceasefire."Blinken along with Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin appeared before the Senate Appropriations Committee regarding the aid package for Israel and Ukraine, New York Post reported. As Blinken started speaking, suddenly a man from the crowd began shouting about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. 
Calling Israel's reciprocation "collective punishment," the protester decried the “bombing of dense population.”Blinken moved forward with his speech, ignoring the protester, but it seems that the demonstrator didn't want the state secretary to continue.“Stop supporting the genocide,” the man went on.“Ceasefire now. Save the children of Gaza. Save the children of Gaza. Ceasefire now. Where is your pride, America?” the protestor added as he was removed.“I do recognize that people feel passionate, but I do ask that we have order in this hearing room and respect our speakers,” Committee Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) warned the spectators.Blinken then carried with his opening remarks, discussing how the Biden administration is standing up for its values and not taking a step back from challenges on the world stage, according to the New York Post.After about a minute, a woman dressed in pink interjected while holding up a sign.“The world is calling for a ceasefire,” she shouted before being dragged out. “Shame on you all. The world is calling for a ceasefire. The American people don’t want to support this brutal war.”After this, another protester stood and coloured his hands red to represent blood and yelled, “No more war,” adding, “It’s a terrible thing to do.”From there, Blinken was interrupted at least three more times, with demonstrators yelling slogans like “Palestinians aren’t evil” and demanding a ceasefire.Perhaps the loudest and most jarring interruption, came when a group began chanting: “From Palestine to Mexico, all the walls have got to go.” For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg is facing strong criticism over a social media post supporting Palestines and Gaza.In a X (formerly Twitter) post made on October 20, Greta can be seen holding a "stand with Gaza" placard along with 3 others also holding pro-palestine, climate awareness posters. Greta had posted the photo with a caption, "Week 270. Today we strike in solidarity with Palestine and Gaza. The world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected."Following the post, the 20-year old was slammed by Israel's official account, who quoted Greta's tweet with pictures of reported victims of Hamas attack. 
They also seemed to mock Greta's environment awareness activities with the caption, "@GretaThunberg, Hamas doesn't use sustainable materials for their rockets which have BUTCHERED innocent Israelis. The victims of the Hamas massacre could have been your friends. Speak up."However, few users came to the support of Greta Thunberg calling out Israel. One user replied to the Israel account's tweet, "your subconscious and true ideals leaked. She said gaza, not hamas. This says a lot. good luck editing this next." Another posted, "This is the most desperate tweet for the year, we should nominate this guys." Another voiced support for Palestines by replying, "We stand with the people of Palestine and will continue to stand with them until the persecution of the people of Palestine end."Greta had posted this cropped photo with the clarification after she faced severe backlash after the first post which had a stuffed Blue Octopus which can be seen as an anti-semitism symbol, which she deleted.

NEW DELHI: After Israel warned Palestinians in north Gaza to relocate to the southern part of the strip ahead of its expected ground offence, a video has emerged on social media showing thousands of war-torn Palestinians fleeing with their essential belongings.Many videos showed a convoy of cars packed with people's belonging, and mattresses strapped to the roof, heading to the south of the Gaza Strip.Flee immediately, warns Israel As its war against Hamas entered the 7th day, the Israeli military on Friday dropped flyers on Gaza warning residents to flee "immediately" to the southern part of the strip. The order directly affects some 1.1 million people living in northern Gaza. 
The order is seen as indicative of a ground offensive as the Israeli military has not outrightly ruled out the possibilities.The Israeli military has been pounding the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip with airstrikes over the past week. The Jewish administration has cut off food, water, fuel and electricity supply as part of its retaliation against Hamas' sudden October 7 attacks on its southern territory.In the aftermath of the warning, Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas warned against a "second Nakba" or catastrophe facing Palestinians.The Nakba refers to some 7,60,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 war that coincided with Israel's creation.Meanwhile, international aid groups warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis after Israel prevented entry of supplies from Egypt to Gaza's 2.3 million citizens.The Israel-Hamas war has claimed at least 2,800 lives on both sides since Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack on October 7.

KOZHIKODE/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The CPM secretariat in Kerala appealed to the Union government on Monday to take measures to ensure the safety of Malayalis presently trapped in Israel, issuing a statement with a more tempered tone after the party's politburo member M A Baby sparked controversy by referring to the west Asian nation as a terrorist state the day before.The statement focused primarily on human rights and the safety of Malayalis, pointing out that the ongoing situation was exacerbated by Israel's annexation of Palestinian territories and the killing of Palestinian civilians. "Such issues should be settled in democratic ways. There should be interventions in this direction," the CPM said.The party highlighted the importance of protecting the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people by implementing the UNSC's dual-state resolution.In response to Baby's statement, the BJP criticised CPM for what it perceived as minority appeasement and vote-bank politics."He (Baby) said Hamas hit out because they were left with no other option. 
But this is part of the religious appeasement of CPM for a few votes," BJP state president K Surendran said, while drawing parallels between the attack on Israel and the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack.He condemned the attack carried out by Hamas, and asserted that both India and Israel are victims of terrorism. He accused the communists of acting as a "fifth column" in this context.Commenting on the ongoing conflict, IUML's Kerala president Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal said Israel's stand had been more extreme than that of Hamas. He suggested that the current conflict might be a response to Israel's invasion and violence against Palestinians.Muslim Youth League, the youth wing of the IUML, announced plans to organise a public event in solidarity with the people of Palestine at Mananchira in Kozhikode on October 12.

Hamas: A controversial history and recent escalation with Israel

The Middle East has once again found itself in the midst of turmoil, as Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist organization ruling the Gaza Strip since 2007, launched a shocking attack inside Israel. The attack has already resulted in hundreds of casualties and hostage situations, sending shockwaves not only through Israel but also across the world. Here, all you want to know about the complex history and current state of Hamas.The Birth of Hamas:Hamas, an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement, was founded in 1987 by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian refugee residing in Gaza. 
Its inception coincided with the first intifada, a period marked by widespread Palestinian protests against Israel's occupation. Hamas was rooted in the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, a prominent Sunni organization founded in Egypt in the 1920s.Violence and Terrorism:From its inception, Hamas has vowed to annihilate Israel and has been responsible for numerous suicide bombings and deadly attacks on both civilians and Israeli soldiers. In 1997, the US designated Hamas as a terrorist group, a classification echoed by the European Union and other Western nations.Political Ascent and Gaza Takeover:In 2006, Hamas achieved a significant political victory by winning parliamentary elections. However, in 2007, it violently seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which is dominated by its rival, the Fatah movement. The Palestinian Authority administers semi-autonomous areas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.The Gaza Blockade:Israel responded to Hamas's takeover by imposing a blockade on Gaza, severely restricting the movement of people and goods to prevent the group from developing weapons. Palestinians argue that this blockade amounts to collective punishment and has taken a toll on Gaza's economy.Shifting Alliances:Over the years, Hamas has received support from various Arab countries, including Qatar and Turkey. However, recent developments have seen the group aligning more closely with Iran and its allies. Hamas leaders Yehia Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh realigned the group's leadership with Iran, Lebanon's Hezbollah. Many of its leaders have relocated to Beirut.Military Capabilities:Hamas's military wing, established under the leadership of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, has carried out suicide bombings and fired tens of thousands of rockets into Israel from Gaza. The group has also constructed tunnels, some for smuggling weapons from Egypt, and others for launching attacks into Israel. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu should be shot dead without trial: Congress MP

KOZHIKODE: Congress MP Rajmohan Unnithan kicked up a controversy with his remark that Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu should be shot dead without a trial."It is high time that Netanyahu, who violated the Geneva Convention, was shot and killed without a trial because that is the level of mass killing being done there (Gaza). The one who takes arms to save one's country, one's own life, one's siblings, is not an extremist. If someone portrays Hamas as extremists, then it is time to respond against them strongly," said the Congress MP.He said that after World War II, those who were charged with war crimes faced Nuremberg model trials, that is, they were shot dead without any trial. "The time has come to conduct a Nuremberg model trial, because Netanyahu is standing before the world as a war criminal," he said. 
Unnithan was speaking at a Palestine solidarity rally organized by the Kasaragod United Muslim Jamaath on Friday. During his speech, Unnithan also hit out at the US and England and said that the US killed 10 lakh Arabs/Muslims in Iraq. In Afghanistan, the US killed 7 lakh Muslims. In Korea and Vietnam, too America killed innocents, he said. "The US's greed for war has still not ended. That is what we are seeing in Palestine," he said. Outraged by "MP Rajmohan Unnithan's reckless and inflammatory speech at the Palestine Rally. His call for the murder of Israeli PM Netanyahu is deplorable, echoing terrorist propaganda. This isn't political discourse; it's a dangerous incitement akin to jihadist extremism. We demand immediate legal action against such radical rhetoric. This isn't about politics; it's about preventing the spread of terrorist ideology," K Surendran said in a tweet. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

In balancing act, PM Modi calls Abbas to condole deaths in Gaza hospital blast

NEW DELHI: India's delicate balancing act on the Gaza conflict saw PM Narendra Modi on Thursday speaking to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and expressing condolences over the loss of civilian lives in the Gaza hospital bombing, which has outraged the world, while also announcing India will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinians.Modi had last week expressed solidarity with Israel in a phone conversation with PM Benjamin Netanyahu and condemned the October 7 Hamas terror attacks that flared up into the present situation. Following the deadly hospital blast that reportedly left hundreds dead, the Prime Minister had for the first time on Wednesday expressed concern at mounting civilian casualties.In his conversation with Abbas, Modi said he shared India's deep concern at "the terrorism, violence and deteriorating security situation in the region".Modi also reiterated India's long-standing principled position on the Israel-Palestine issue of support to efforts for establishing a sovereign, independent and viable Palestine State, living within secure and recognised borders, side by side at peace with Israel.Like the US, India has so far not called for a ceasefire but the government realises many of its Arab partners are deeply concerned about the impact of Israel's retaliatory action against Hamas on civilians in Gaza. While the US has absolved Israel of any blame for the hospital blast, its Arab allies have strongly condemned Israel for what they see as the deadliest air strike by the country since 2008.Earlier in the day, the ministry of external affairs reiterated India's call for strict adherence to international humanitarian law that is applicable to conflicts and seeks protection of civilians and unimpeded passage for humanitarian aid."We have strongly condemned the horrific terrorist attack on Israel. 
The international community must stand together in combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations," said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. "On the Palestine issue, we have reiterated our position in favour of direct negotiations for a two-state solution. We have also expressed our concern at the civilian casualties and the humanitarian situation. We would urge strict observance of international humanitarian law," Bagchi added.

Who is 'The Guest'? Hamas' 'mastermind' behind Israel attack

NEW DELHI: Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri is a Hamas leader also known as 'El Deif' or 'The Guest', for staying low-key for decades by changing houses every night. El Deif's frequent switches were intended to evade being tracked or killed by Israeli forces, reported CNN.El Deif is reportedly in charge of the Hamas' military wing, AI Qassem Brigades -- responsible for carrying out the deadliest attack on the Israeli population on October 7.Mkhaimar Abusada, a professor of political science at Al Azhar University in Gaza, told CNN that having been born in the 1960s, El Deif is little known to ordinary Palestinians."He's very much like a ghost to the majority of the Palestinians," said Abusada.The Al Qassem Brigades opposed the peace process endorsed by Yassir Arafat, the then-leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They also opposed the 1993 Oslo Accords, which were intended to facilitate the establishment of a two-state solution, enabling a new Palestinian state to coexist peacefully with Israel.Israel has vowed to annihilate the Hamas militant groupIn 1996, El Deif, an accomplished bomb maker, was behind a wave of four suicide attacks that killed 65 people in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other outrages intended to derail the peace process, CNN reported.Bomb-makers like El Deif and other decision-takers were hunted by Israel.An Israeli air strike killed El Deif's wife and daughter in 2014. He lost part of an arm, a leg and his hearing. 
No doubt his hatred for Israel intensified then. But his emotions were leavened with zealous cunning. And the first, and most important deception, was to transform the Israeli perception of Hamas, according to CNN.Hamas, in the past two years under El Deif's guidance, was reportedly successful in making the Israeli government believe that the outfit was more focused on domestic issues like rebuilding Gaza, and security work permits for people to "seek employment in Israel".Israeli forces, since the October 7 attack, have put the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, under a total siege and bombarded it with unprecedented air strikes. Gaza authorities say more than 2,200 people have been killed, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's representative at the United Nations on Monday ignored the loss of lives in Israel after the deadly invasion by Hamas even as he called for a moment of silence for the Palestinians who died from the retaliatory Israeli attacks.Ambassador Zaman Mehdi, Pakistan's deputy permanent representative to the UN, was seen in a post on X pointing out the tragic loss of lives and ongoing violence as a reminder of over seven decades of "illegal foreign occupation, aggression, and disregard for international law, including UNESCO resolutions".He then led a moment of silence at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in the memory of the "innocent lives" lost in the "occupied Palestinian territory and elsewhere", with no mention of Israeli victims.According to a report in the New York Post, the Pakistan ambassador said that the 16-year-long blockade of Gaza was illegal and expressed concerns that efforts to normalize the situation were inadvertently fueling violence."In this context, the so-called declaration of war and attacks on civilian population and their properties is deeply distressing," he said, referring to Israeli cabinet's decision to declare war after Saturday morning's multi-front attacks.Notably, Pakistan has been expressing solidarity with Palestine amid the violence fomented by the militant group Hamas.On Sunday, Pakistan's caretaker foreign minister Jalil Abbas Jilani said he was "deeply concerned" regarding the increasing hostilities in the Middle East and urged Israel to promptly halt its actions of oppression in occupied Palestine.

Prominent singer and influencer Dalal Abu Amneh, hailing from Nazareth, was recently held in police custody for a two-day period before being released on bail. This action was taken in response to her social media posts related to the conflict in Gaza, as reported by the BBC. She is currently placed under house arrest until Monday.The content that drew police attention was an image featuring the Palestinian flag accompanied by the Arabic phrase: "There is no victor but God."Abu Amneh's lawyer, Abeer Baker, argued that her client was expressing a religious sentiment with this post, which has been a common phrase in Arabic culture. 
However, Israeli authorities interpreted the post as potentially inciting violence or serving as a call to arms for Palestinians.Israel has adopted a "zero tolerance policy" toward social media activity perceived as supportive of Hamas since the onset of the conflict with the group. Accoridng to BBC, Abu Amneh is one of many Arab citizens of Israel who have faced arrests or disciplinary actions for their social media posts related to the war.Israeli Arabs, often referred to as Palestinian citizens of Israel, constitute approximately one-fifth of the country's population.In response to the recent hostilities with Hamas, the Israeli police have reportedly investigated and detained over 100 individuals for their social media activity. This has led to the arrest and questioning of 63 people in Jerusalem alone. "Anyone inciting against the State of Israel, its government symbols, elected officials, military personnel and police, should be aware that the Israel Police will respond firmly and without leniency," said Israel's Police Commissioner, Yaakov Shabtai, at a meeting with senior leaders this week, the BBC reported.

BBC draws Sunak flak for not calling Hamas 'terrorist' outfit

The BBC is facing criticism from PM Rishi Sunak and several of his ministers for not calling Hamas a "terrorist organisation", besides being forced to institute an internal investigation into some BBC Arabic staff allegedly supporting Hamas on social media."We are urgently investigating this matter. We take allegations of breaches of our editorial and social media guidelines with the utmost seriousness, and if and when we find breaches we will act, including taking disciplinary action," a BBC spokesperson said on Sunday.A massive pro-Palestine protest took place in London the previous day, with protesters chanting slogans like "From the river to the sea, Palestine must be free" and "Israel is a terror state".Police had to intervene and retrieve an Israeli flag that protesters had stamped on to prevent it from being burned.Some protesters chased a lone man carrying an Israeli flag down the street until police intervened, shielding him even as war cries rent the air.Many British Jews now say they feel unsafe in Britain.Hamas was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the British government in 2021, meaning anyone supporting the group can face 14 years in jail.The BBC describes Hamas terrorists as "Palestinian militants" and "Hamas fighters", refusing to use the word "terrorist".A source at 10 Downing Street told TOI, "The PM has said repeatedly that Hamas are not militants, they are terrorists. 
It is incumbent on our national broadcaster to recognise this fact."The organisation Palestine Action took responsibility for splattering the BBC's headquarters with red paint on Saturday, writing on social media, "Spreading the occupation's lies and manufacturing consent for Israel's war crimes means that you have Palestinian blood on your hands."The Daily Telegraph reported that several BBC Arabic journalists appeared to celebrate the Hamas attack on Israel.It said reporters endorsed comments likening Hamas to freedom fighters besides describing the October 7 attack on Israel as a "morning of hope".Twelve societies at Oxford University have joined 31 Harvard societies in blaming the violence on "Israel's apartheid regime".Oxford South Asian Society and Oxford South Asian Ambedkar Forum are among the societies to have issued the joint statement, saying the root cause of "ongoing violence" is "Israeli settler-colonial occupation and apartheid"."The events of the past several days did not take place in a vacuum: rather, they are the result of Palestinians' long-brewing and well-founded anger," it states.

Mia Khalifa posts Amy Schumer's heated exchange with Asia Jackson over Israel-Palestine conflict

In the wake of the recent conflict between Hamas and Israel, celebrities have taken to social media to express their opinions on the matter, leading to some of them facing backlash for their comments. Notably, former adult film star Mia Khalifa and comedian Amy Schumer have found themselves at the center of a social media storm due to their controversial remarks regarding the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, reported Newsweek.The conflict escalated on October 7 when Hamas initiated a militant attack on Israel. In response, Israel launched airstrikes on Gaza and later commenced ground operations. As of November 2, the Associated Press reported at least 1,400 casualties in Israel, according to the Israeli military, while authorities in Gaza claimed that 8,800 individuals had lost their lives.Amy Schumer, who was raised Jewish, has been an outspoken supporter of Israel, whereas Lebanese-American Mia Khalifa has been a staunch advocate for the Palestinian cause. 
However, it is Khalifa's alleged praise of Hamas that has led to calls for her "cancellation," rather than her support for Gaza's civilian population.Khalifa recently lost her podcasting contract with Playboy after referring to Hamas as "freedom fighters" on social media. On the other hand, Amy Schumer faced backlash for accusing several news outlets of blaming Israel for the Gaza hospital bombing on October 17 without proper fact-checking, although later reports indicated that the missile was indeed fired from within Gaza towards Israel.On November 1, Mia Khalifa shared a post on X, a platform previously known as Twitter. The post originally came from Black and Indigenous Filipino actress Asia Jackson, featuring screenshots of an Instagram message exchange between her and Schumer. Schumer appears to have initiated contact with Jackson after she had commented, "It's so crazy to me how Bella & Gigi had to tiptoe around their statements and then Amy Schumer is like 'Gazans are rapists' and will still have a career."In response to Jackson's comment, Schumer asked, "Did something I posted about my people being massacred upset you?" Jackson replied, "The Islamophobia and generalization of Gazan people did." Schumer continued, "People all over the world are in the streets yelling for the murder of my people," and accused Jackson of being uneducated about the history of the Jewish people and the conflict, expressing her belief that Jackson was antisemitic.Schumer further inquired if Jackson had any Jewish friends, highlighting their fears for their children and lives in the context of the ongoing conflict, and accused Jackson of posting the screenshots on X to advance her career. Jackson defended herself, stating, "Very curious to hear how you know that I'm not educated about the conflict? How do you know that? You literally just followed me, you don't know who I am."In response to Schumer's comments, X users criticized her, with one user named Meech expressing their astonishment at Schumer's remarks to a "BLACK AND INDIGENOUS FILIPINA." Another user, samah fadil, commented that Schumer seemed like the type of person who had engaged in racially insensitive behavior, which garnered significant attention online.The message exchange quickly went viral, prompting Khalifa to silently weigh in by reposting comments from other users and sharing posts from public figures supporting Palestinians, including Angelina Jolie and author Dan Kovalik. While Khalifa refrained from posting her own thoughts on social media after losing her contract with Playboy, she continued to engage with content supportive of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.On November 1, Amy Schumer took to Instagram to address the backlash against her. In her post, she emphasized her desire for the safety of both Jewish and Muslim communities and pushed back against accusations of Islamophobia or supporting genocide. Schumer also addressed personal attacks on her appearance and career, asserting her status as the "most successful female comedian of all time."She concluded by acknowledging the pain that the ongoing conflict has caused and expressed her love for all people, despite the divisive rhetoric surrounding the Israel-Palestine issue.

A pro-Palestine activist tossed dozens of live mice into a Birmingham McDonald’s causing panic among the customers, Daily Mail reported.Wearing what appeared to be a Palestinian flag as a head covering, the man entered the Star City McDonald's and tossed painted mice, colored in the Palestinian flag's shades of red, green, white, and black. Upon spotting the mice on the floor, two women who were in the process of ordering at a self-service kiosk reacted with shock, jumping and screaming in surprise, reported Daily Mail.Before driving away in his car, the activist repeatedly yelled: ‘Free f***ing Palestine’, ‘Boycott Israel’ and ‘F*** Israel’.Images circulated on the internet seemed to show the spray-painted animals inside different plastic containers.The video was captioned: ‘Targeted boycott. The Big Three. 
Start by boycotting these brands that are directly involved in supporting the Israeli apartheid.’McDonald's has verified that several of the animals were released and assured that they have been successfully removed.It said in a statement: ‘Following the removal of the mice, the restaurant has been fully sanitised and our pest control partners have been called out to conduct a full inspection.’A significant number of pro-Palestine activists have been urging people to boycott prominent brands that are either still operating in or supporting Israel. Companies such as McDonald's, Burger King, Domino's Pizza, Nike, and several others have faced public condemnation from activists worldwide.The protests have coincided with clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators in London for the second consecutive weekend, following a massive gathering of nearly 500,000 individuals demanding a ceasefire. Over 1,000 Metropolitan Police officers were present at the demonstration, where protestors ignited fireworks and released red and green flares, Daily Mail reported.

NEW DELHI: In the first substantive statement on the Israel-Palestine conflict, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Thursday slammed the indiscriminate bombing of the hospital in Gaza and sought that the perpetrators be held accountable, even as he demanded the creation of a sovereign Palestine. Kharge also condemned Israel's bombing of civilian areas of Gaza and slammed Hamas for attacking Israel.Rahul Gandhi wrote on X, "The killing of thousands of innocent civilians, including children in Gaza and the collective punishment of millions of people by cutting off their food, water and electricity are crimes against humanity. Hamas' killing of innocent Israelis and taking of hostages is a crime and must also be condemned. The cycle of violence between Israel and Palestine must be brought to an end."The remarks were significant for Congress naming Hamas for the first time since the war broke out. The issue also figured in the CWC meet last week, where a senior leader lamented that the traditional party support for Palestine had weakened, only to be told empathy for Palestine did not mean support for Hamas. With a dispute arising over the hospital bombing, Kharge and Rahul did not name Israel upfront as the perpetrator, but implied it enough.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Israeli-Palestinian conflict has become a topic of controversy at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, a private women's liberal arts institution. According to reports, some resident advisers at one of the campus dorms sent an email with anti-Israel sentiments to the students living there.In the email sent to Munger Hall residents, the residence hall leaders criticized Israel for its actions against Hamas and stated that there should be no place for Zionism within the Wellesley College community. The message was conveyed by Moi Nee, the Munger Hall house president, on behalf of the "Munger Res Staff.", reported Fox News."As of October 18th, 2023, the Palestinian-Israeli war has cost the lives of some 3,478 Palestinians and wounded 12,000. Israel’s apartheid against Palestinians, characterized by the displacement of 600,000 individuals, the dissemination of genocidal rhetoric by the Israeli government, and the illegal occupation of native Palestinian lands, have left our hearts heavy," the email stated. Taking into account all historical, political, and territorial factors, it is necessary to express strong disapproval of the Israeli Zionist government. 
Additionally, individuals who support the involuntary displacement of Palestinians should be identified as advocates for colonization."Munger Hall stands in strong condemnation of Israel's actions and those who have supported their actions against Palestinians. We firmly believe that there should be no space, no consideration, and no support for Zionism within the Wellesley College community," the email added.In addition to the comments, the residence hall leaders said they "plan on donating to a reputable organization that provides aid to the children and families whose lives have been destroyed."The residence hall leaders, who also pointed to campus resources as lines of support for students during "this devastating time," concluded the email by saying, "We care about each and every one of you, and please feel free to reach out with any ideas of how we can best support you during these difficult times."When contacted for a statement, a media relations representative from the school directed Fox News Digital to an email sent by Wellesley College President Paula Johnson to the community on October 20th. In the email, President Paula Johnson highlighted that the residential hall heads were informed of their duty to provide support to all students."It recently came to my attention that a small number of student residence hall leaders from one dormitory sent a letter to their housemates in their capacity as resident assistants that expressed views on the Israel-Hamas conflict," Johnson said in the email. "Our Student Life team met with these students and talked about their role and responsibility to support all students. They have since sent an apology to all students in the residence hall. That these young leaders were able to learn from this episode gives me hope."As president of Wellesley, I have often spoken about inclusive excellence and the importance of listening and learning across difference. Today, I feel even more strongly that this work is more necessary than ever and requires significant effort, focus, and courage."In recent weeks, several colleges have witnessed a surge in anti-Israel protests by pro-Palestinian students and student groups.In subsequent communications with the student residents, Nee, representing herself and other leaders in the residence hall, expressed remorse for any harm caused by their previous communication. Nee's email, which was later obtained by Novak, addressed the situation as follows:"Hello all, I would like to address the email that was sent last night on behalf of the Munger HP and 4 Munger RAs," Nee wrote in the email, which was later obtained by Novak. "We regret any harm our words have caused to our residents, parents, alumni, or others in the community. "We are also truly sorry if it has dissuaded anyone from coming to us as RAs or an HP. We overstepped our roles as reslife staff in making this statement and apologize for that."The views expressed do not reflect the views of Paula Queenan (our CD), Cathy Bickel, the Office of Residential Life and Student Housing, Wellesley administration, the Munger community as a whole, or anyone else in the college," Nee added. "We want our residents to know that while we never intended so, we understand how making this statement has caused hurt to specific populations in our community."We as a staff are committed to rebuilding trust and repairing relationships in the Munger community," she added. "If anybody has felt affected by the message sent last night, please feel free to reach out to us to talk. We hope to hold a community space for Munger residents soon regarding this issue. All my best, Moi"In recent times, a number of colleges have observed an increase in protests related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by pro-Palestinian students and student organizations.(Via Fox News Digital) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

MUMBAI: Head of International Sufi Caravan and president of All India Ilm-O-Hunar Foundation Mufti Manzur Ziyaee has thanked PM Narendra Modi for India's humanitarian aid to the conflict-affected people of Gaza in Palestine. Recently, the ministry of external affairs announced that an Indian Air Force C-17 flight carried approximately 6.5 tonnes of medical aid and 32 tonnes of disaster relief supplies for the conflict-affected people of Palestine. The aid included life-saving medicines, surgical equipment, tents, sleeping bags, tarpaulins, sanitary utilities, water purification tablets, and other essential items to help people of Gaza who have been affected by the ongoing conflict. 
"This is a great gesture on the part of our PM Shri Narendra Modiji as the help will go on mitigating the pain of people in Gaza. We welcome this gesture and thank the PM for upholding the age-old Indian policy of helping the needy caught in conflict anywhere in the world," said Ziyaee. Calling upon the world leaders to intervene and stop the Israel-Hamas conflict which has already resulted in thousands of deaths and damage to infrastructure, Ziyaee said killing of innocents whatever the provocation cannot be justified and must be condemned."Every human life is valuable and there is no glory in killing innocents, including women and children," he said. Invoking teachings of Sufism and Sufi masters, Ziyaee said Sufism emphasizes on hate for none and love for all and it is the duty of every thinking leader in the world to try and establish peace on this earth. "Sufism embraces all races despite differences of caste, color and gender. We appeal to all sides to bring a ceasefire immediately and establish peace in Palestine. More humanitarian aid needs to be rushed there," he said.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Cornell Professor Russell Rickford, who sparked controversy with his remarks regarding the Hamas terror attack on Israel, is now on a leave of absence until the end of the semester.According to a report in the New York Post, Russell Rickford, an associate professor of history, faced widespread criticism after making statements during a pro-Palestinian protest following the October 7 surprise attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,400 people, primarily civilians.He described the attack as "exhilarating" and "energizing," leading to significant backlash, New York Post reported."It was exhilarating. It was exhilarating, it was energizing," he was seen telling the crowd, claiming "you would not be human" not to feel the same.Earlier, Rickford defended his statements but later issued an apology, acknowledging that his words were "reprehensible." Consequently, his students were informed that he would no longer be teaching for the remainder of the semester. 
According to the New York Post, a petition calling for his termination on Change.org gained nearly 11,000 signatures, including support from notable figures such as US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and US Representative Claudia Tenney.In response to the controversy, Cornell University confirmed that Professor Russell Rickford had requested and received approval for a leave of absence. The university also reassigned his course to Professor Tamika Nunley, who will assume teaching responsibilities for the post-Civil War African American history course. Cornell's leadership, including President Martha Pollack and board of trustees chairman Kraig Kayser, denounced Rickford's remarks, describing them as "reprehensible" and confirming that the university is taking the incident seriously and reviewing it in accordance with its procedures, the New York Post reported.In his recent apology, Rickford expressed his opposition to racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, militarism, fundamentalism, and all systems that dehumanize, divide, and oppress people. Initially, he had refused to retract his statements, explaining that he was referring to the initial hours of the attack when it appeared to symbolize resistance in the Palestinian struggle."I apologize for the horrible choice of words that I used in a portion of a speech that was intended to stress grassroots African American, Jewish and Palestinian traditions of resistance to oppression," he added.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday continued BJP's questioning of the Congress's stance on Israel-Palestine conflict saying that the resolution passed by the CWC was similar to statements issued by Pakistan and the Taliban. "Congress's resolution has striking similarities with statements of Pakistan and Taliban in three aspects. Do not condemn Hamas, do not deplore terror attacks on Israel, silent on hostages - women and children," Sarma said in a post in X.He further said that sacrificing the nation's interest to politics of appeasement is in the Congress's DNA.In his post, the Assam chief minister shared the Congress Working Committee (CWC) resolution issued on last Monday and highlighted the parts of the conflict, which read: "Finally the CWC expresses its dismay and anguish on the war that has broken out in the Middle East where over a thousand people have been killed in the last two days. 
The CWC reiterates its long-standing support for the rights of the Palestinian people to land, self-government and to live with dignity and respect. The CWC calls for an immediate ceasefire and for negotiations to begin on all outstanding issues including the imperative issues that have given rise to the present conflict."Sarma also shared the statements issued by Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Pakistan, in its statement, which was shared by Sarma, said, "Pakistan has consistently advocated for a two-state solution as the key to enduring peace in the Middle East, with a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestine question anchored in the international law and in line with relevant United Nations and OIC resolutions. A viable, sovereign and contiguous state of Palestine should be established on the basis of the pre-1967 border, with Al Quds Al-Sharif as its capital."The Taliban government in Afghanistan, in its stateme-nt, said, "The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan declares its su-pport for the legitimate, historical, and legal rights of the Palestinian people to have an independent state in the historical land of Palestinians and calls on the Islamic countries, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the international community and especially the influential countries in the region, to prevent the violence of the Israeli occupying forces against the innocent people of Palestine and to solve the Palestinian issue on the basis of granting the legitimate rights of the Palestinians."

BRICS Gaza summit: India bats for lasting solution as Xi, Putin seek ceasefire

As the Brics leaders sought an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, foreign minister S Jaishankar treaded a fine line on what he described as a complex issue with many dimensions by blaming the October 7 Hamas attacks for the present crisis and simultaneously calling for the concerns of the Palestinian people to be addressed in a serious and sustainable manner.Addressing leaders whose position has been at odds with India on the issue of Gaza ceasefire, Jaishankar said this can only happen with a 2-State solution that is based on peaceful co-existence and that India had been consistently supportive of international efforts towards that end. The minister, who filled in for PM Narendra Modi, condemned civilian deaths, sought efforts for lasting solutions and said there should be no compromise on terrorism.Among all Brics member-states, including the 6 newly added countries, only India and Ethiopia didn’t back the resolution that came up last month at the UNGA for a humanitarian truce. India abstained because the resolution didn’t explicitly condemn the Hamas terror attacks. 
Jaishankar said it was important to address all aspects of the conflict and to prioritise. “Our endeavour should be to both make a difference on the ground immediately while also creating conditions for lasting solutions,” he said.The summit saw South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who chaired the Brics extraordinary meeting on Gaza, accusing Israel of committing war crimes and saying that the deliberate denial of medicine, fuel, food and water to the residents of Gaza was tantamount to genocide. Ramaphosa also called for holding Hamas accountable for its attacks on civilians and for taking hostages.Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping also attended the meeting. While Putin sought ceasefire in Gaza and blamed the US for the crisis, Xi suggested an international peace conference to end the conflict and work towards an early solution to the Palestine question that is “comprehensive, just, and sustainable”.Jaishankar said in his remarks that the conflict in Gaza was causing immense human suffering, including to civilians, elderly, women and children and welcomed all efforts of the international community towards de-escalation.“Right now, there is an urgent need to ensure that humanitarian aid and relief effectively and safely reach the population of Gaza. It is also imperative that all hostages are released. We believe that there is a universal obligation to observe international humanitarian law,” he said, reiterating India’s position.The minister, however, also said that the immediate crisis was triggered by the Hamas terrorist attack and that nobody should compromise on the issue of terrorism. “Hostage taking is equally unacceptable and cannot be condoned. Subsequent developments have deepened our concern even more as we witness large scale civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis,” he said, adding that PM Narendra Modi has highlighted the need to create conditions for peace and restart direct and meaningful peace negotiations.The minister recalled how, over the years, India has supported the socio-economic welfare of the Palestinian people and strengthening of their national institutions and that India’s development partnership is geared towards these objectives. “Along with the need for restraint and immediate humanitarian support, India also emphasizes peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue and diplomacy,” he said, adding that the economic assistance to Palestine, developmental projects there and financial support to Palestinian Authority reflected India’s position.

Pushed into a corner on Hamas attack, Congress says even Vajpayee endorsed Palestinian cause

NEW DELHI: Pushed into a corner over its apparent unwillingness to call out the Hamas-led attack on Israel as a 'terrorist attack', Congress on Tuesday rubbished BJP's claims that it is "supporting" terror organisations and said BJP was resorting to diversionary tactics to hide its failures in handling the worsening situation in North-East, the party's internal squabbling in Rajasthan, and its impending defeat in poll-bound states.Congress' deputy leader in Lok Sabha, Gaurav Gogoi, slammed BJP's attempts to do politics when the security of Indians is at stake. "It is very sad that BJP is trying to play politics over Congress resolution. We are all deeply saddened by what happened. 
We are concerned about every Indian, whether in Israel or Gaza, and we want that they should remain safe. Our focus should be on ensuring they return safely. All this is being said so they can hide their failures in Sikkim, the internal factionalism in Rajasthan, and the number of people unhappy over the BJP list there. The position we have taken in the party is clear and no one except BJP is trying to use it to distort and distract," Gogoi said.He also urged BJP to refer to speeches made by its own leader Atal Bihari Vajpaee, and his endorsement of the Palestinian cause. "BJP is rattled by Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra and the impact it has had. In their desperation, they have forgotten their history, and the speech of their own leader," Gogoi said.Questions about Congress' position on the Israel-Palestine war cropped up after the party, in its initial reaction on Sunday slammed the "brutal attacks" on Israel and called for a dialogue, while endorsing the legitimate aspirations of the people of Palestine. A day later, however, the Congress Working Committee tweaked its statement following pressure from Kerala CLP leader Ramesh Chennithala to take a line on the Israel-Palestine conflict that underlines the "two-state" option. This, Chennithala said would reflect Congress' traditional stance in light of Indira Gandhi's close relations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation of Yasser Arafat.The CWC then adopted a resolution that said, "The CWC expresses its dismay and anguish on the war... The CWC reiterates its long-standing support for the rights of the Palestinian people to land, self-government and to live with dignity and respect. The CWC calls for an immediate ceasefire and for negotiations to begin on all outstanding issues..." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Concerted effort in US to squash pro-Palestinian views amid Israel-Hamas war: Report

NEW DELHI: There are widespread efforts to stifle pro-Palestinian viewpoints in the United States in the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel, as per the Guardian's report.A prominent American Jewish organization reportedly forced cancelation of the national conference of a major Palestinian advocacy group, alleging that it was a front for Hamas.Palestinian American activists have reported instances of television networks censoring or scrapping scheduled interviews. Furthermore, NPR and the BBC withdrew advertising for a highly acclaimed new book addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict attributing to "listener complaints."The Orthodox Jewish Chamber of Commerce allegedly exerted pressure on Hilton hotels, resulting in the cancellation of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights event in Houston, where Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib was set to be the main speaker, calling it front for Hamas.According to Ahmad Abuznaid, USCPR director Hilton reported receiving numerous calls to cancel the event but clarified that the hotel does not take a stance on political matters and just wanted to implement a security plan. Abuznaid also said that Hilton presented the group with a $100,000 bill for security and gave them a 48-hour deadline. Before a settlement could be made, the booking was canceled the following day. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott backed the cancellation, as he posted on X, "No place in Texas should host or sponsor USCPR".The chamber is also actively advocating for Starbucks to close its stores and terminate thousands of workers after their union posted a statement on X expressing "Solidarity with Palestine." In response, Starbucks agreed to file a lawsuit against the union to prevent it from using "Starbucks Workers United" and the company logo but said it would be illegal to close the stores. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation, also announced the cancellation of its annual banquet in Arlington, Virginia, scheduled, due to bomb threats. It reportedly made the decision after discussions with the Marriott hotel saying, "In recent days, according to the Marriott, anonymous callers have threatened to plant bombs in the hotel's parking garage, kill specific hotel staff in their homes, and storm the hotel in a repeat of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol if the events moved forward".Palestinian American activists have argued that the cancellation of these conferences is part of a broader effort by staunch supporters of Israel, leveraging the extreme rhetoric from certain student and left-wing groups that either celebrate or justify Hamas actions, to shut down critical views against Israel.Palestinian American human rights lawyer Noura Erakat, made live appearances on CBS and ABC but later found that segments were removed from the online playbacks.Rakat said that she was invited to discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza but not delve into the broader causes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She said, "They want us to discuss the loss of life but not to provide context or discuss responsibility."Other Palestinian American analysts have reported similar treatment by television networks.Pro-Israel organizations have also reportedly targeted Palestinian American journalists. The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (Camera), a right-wing group that seeks to influence media coverage, accused the Palestinian American managing editor of the Los Angeles Times, Sara Yasin, of having sympathy for Hamas stemming from her reposting an article from an American Jewish magazine critical of the Gaza attack, along with some earlier retweets, which the LA times refuted. An American Arab journalist wishing to remain anonymous alleged the existence of a coordinated effort aimed at undermining the credibility of reporters bearing Arab names by branding them as biased.In Germany, the Frankfurt Book Fair also faced accusations of "silencing" Palestinian voices when an awards ceremony meant to honor a novel by Palestinian writer Adania Shibli was canceled following an attack by Hamas.

'Death is better than leaving': Gaza civilians refuse to evacuate 'hellhole' despite Israel claiming Hamas are using them as human shields

NEW DELHI: Despite being given a 24-hour notice by Israel to evacuate before a full-scale assault, resolute individuals in Gaza who chose not to leave have stated their preference to stay and face potential death rather than abandoning their homes. Although some individuals did heed the evacuation call, there was minimal evidence of a widespread departure by Friday afternoon, even though the UN had cautioned that the region was rapidly deteriorating into a dire situation, Dailymail reported.A 20-year-old named Mohammad, standing on the street outside a building reduced to debris from an Israeli airstrike two days ago near the center of Gaza, said, "'Death is better than leaving. I was born here, and I will die here, leaving is a stigma.". In the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, where power supplies have been cut and essential resources like food and water are becoming scarce due to a week of retaliatory air strikes and a complete Israeli blockade, the UN has declared an untenable situation for Gaza's civilians. Martin Griffiths, the UN's aid chief, wrote on social media, "The noose around the civilian population in Gaza is tightening. How are 1.1 million people supposed to move across a densely populated warzone in less than 24 hours?"
.Hamas has pledged to continue their fight until the very end. In response to Israel's advice for residents to evacuate to evade the ongoing assault, citing concerns that Hamas 'is using you as human shields',  Hamas encouraged the people to remain in place.While a significant number of Palestinians opted to remain, thousands of them still made efforts to travel south. People used both cars and walked as they attempted to reach the southern region of this densely populated area, which is the residence of 2.4 million people within its 362,140 square miles. However, everyone striving to evade the devastation caused by Israel's bombs faces a fundamental dilemma: "Where to go?"29-year-old Umm Hossam said, "How long will the strikes and death last? We have no homes left, every area of Gaza is under threat". 'We call on Arab countries to protect us. Where are the Arabs? Enough! Enough!' she cried.The northern section of the Gaza Strip includes the largest settlement, which is Gaza City. According to the UN, there were indications that Israel was pushing for the entire population to relocate across the wetlands that divide the territory.The Israeli military accused Hamas of hiding in and under civilian buildings. It warned, "Civilians of Gaza City, evacuate south for your own safety and the safety of your families and distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields".Israel argues that the devastating attacks on its civilian population means it must elimination the terrorist group. During the overnight operation, Israel targeted 750 military sites, including Hamas tunnels, military facilities, residences of senior operatives, and weapon storage depots.Hamas's military wing reported that the recent airstrikes resulted in the deaths of 13 captives they had previously exchanged with Israel. They retaliated by launching 150 rockets at Israel.The United Nations expressed Israel's request for Gaza's civilians to evacuate cannot happen 'without devastating humanitarian consequences' .Israel condemned the UN's position and argued that the UN should denounce Hamas and endorse Israel's right to self-defense.Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said, "We are fighting for our home. We are fighting for our future. The path will be long, but ultimately I promise you we will win".Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority and a rival of Hamas, conveyed to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a meeting in Jordan that the  forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza would amount to a repetition of the events in 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were either forced to flee or displaced from Israel. The majority of Gaza's residents are the descendants of these refugees.Abbas urged for the immediate entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. However, Israel has declared that it will not lift its blockade until its citizens held hostage by Hamas are released.During their conversation, Antony Blinken and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deliberated on the establishment of safe zones in Gaza 'where civilians could relocate to be safe from Israel's legitimate security operations,', as disclosed by a U.S. State Department representative to the press.White House national security spokesman, John Kirby, acknowledged that organising such a massive evacuation was a 'tall order'. However, he emphasised that the United States would not question or doubt its ally's decision to instruct civilians to move out of the way. He further said on MSNBC, "We understand what they're trying to do and why they're trying to do this - to try to isolate the civilian population from Hamas, which is their real target".Despite Israel's call for evacuation, there were minimal indications of people leaving Gaza City. Instead, a group assembled at al-Shifa Hospital, expressing their determination to stay. In the southern and central regions of the enclave, where people were expected to seek refuge, Palestinians reported overnight airstrikes, with additional strikes in central areas on Friday morning. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said that there was no safe place throughout the entire Gaza Strip.According to the United Nations' humanitarian office (OCHA), over 400,000 individuals in Gaza have already been displaced from their homes, and 23 aid workers have lost their lives.  'Mass displacement continues,' OCHA said.The United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) announced that it had relocated its primary operations center and international personnel to the southern Gaza. UNRWA also appealed to Israel to not target its shelters.White House national security spokesman John Kirby conveyed that U.S. officials were in collaboration with both Israel and Egypt to facilitate the safe passage of civilians in the area.'Obviously, we don't want to see any civilians hurt,' Kirby said on CNN. 'These Palestinian people, they're victims, too. They didn't ask for this. They didn't invite Hamas in and say, you know, 'Go hit Israel.''During his visit to Tel Aviv, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin mentioned that military assistance was being provided to Israel, emphasizing that this was the time for resolve and not revenge.On Friday, Antony Blinken held meetings with Jordan's King Abdullah as well as Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-rule in the West Bank but lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007. Blinken will also visit Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates.Iran issued a warning regarding potential responses from its allies, including Hamas and the influential Hezbollah movement in Lebanon. The Israeli military reported attempts by gunmen to infiltrate across the Lebanese border.Iran's foreign minister held a meeting with the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nassrallah, in Lebanon. Following their meeting, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian stated that any ongoing war crimes against Palestine and Gaza would provoke a response from the broader alliance.Jewish communities in other countries expressed fear of possible attacks. In Paris, law enforcement resorted to tear gas and water cannons to disperse a prohibited demonstration in support of the Palestinians. In Amsterdam and London, some Jewish schools were planning temporary closures due to safety concerns. Police in New York and Los Angeles increased their presence around synagogues and Jewish community centres. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

The notorious spyware previously came under fire for helping governments to allegedly spy on journalists, human rights activists, among others but now, it is said to be used to locate those kidnapped by Hamas terrorist organisation. As per a report, Israel appears to be using NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to track those kidnapped/ murdered by Hamas.Citing a source with direct knowledge of NSO's operations, Axios reports that several Israeli agencies are likely using Pegasus to help track people kidnapped by Hamas, as well as people who have gone missing during Hamas' attack last month.What is Pegasus and how it is usedPegasus is a spyware that can be installed on a target's device without them knowing. Then it can be used to tap into phone signals to assess who was on the ground during Hamas' attack on October 7.Pegasus can also be used to track movement of those cell signals before and after the attack, the source was cited as saying. 
The report also noted that NSO Group has also established a “war room” with other similar companies and former NSO employees.“It's not the purpose of why we're doing it, but I think the people from the government — both in Israel and outside of Israel — and the public... now understand much better the value of these kinds of tools and why they are needed,” the source was quoted as saying.Broader surveillance of PalestiniansThe source, however, said that they do not have any information whether the Israeli government has safeguards to ensure the technology won't be used for broad surveillance of the Palestinian population.There have been reports suggesting that Pegasus was used to spy on Palestinian human rights activists in 2021.The report also said that Israeli agencies can decide for themselves how they use Pegasus. "They have their own means, and I know they have legal counsel with them to know who exactly they can target or not," the person was quoted as saying. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Hamas leader addressed rally against Hinduism, Zionism

KOCHI: Former Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal virtually addressed a rally in support of Palestinians organised by a Jamaat-e-Islami Hind-aligned outfit in Kerala's Malappuram on Friday, sparking a row as BJP termed it an "alarming glorification of terrorists" and asked how the Left-governed state allowed it.The organisers - Solidarity Youth Movement (SYM) - dismissed the controversy, asserting in a press note that Hamas is a "resistance movement" and Meshaal a "freedom fighter".Meshaal's pre-recorded video address in Arabic was beamed on a screen at the Youth Resistance Rally, which had the tagline "Uproot Bulldozer Hindutva and Apartheid Zionism". The organisers had announced that another Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, would also virtually address the rally, but he did not.State BJP president K Surendran termed the instance "alarming". "Where is (CM) Pinarayi Vijayan's police? Under the disguise of 'Save Palestine' they are glorifying Hamas, a terrorist organisation and its leaders as 'warriors'. This is unacceptable," Surendran wrote on X while sharing a photo of Meshal's virtual address.The organisers justified Meshaal's virtual presence at the event. "The Palestinian Legislative Council is an influential movement in Gaza and the West Bank. 
The party won 74 of 132 seats in the last election. There is nothing unusual about the leader of such an organisation speaking at a Palestinian solidarity event in Malappuram," SYM state president CT Shuhaib said in a statement."Hamas is not an active or banned organisation in India. So, the presence of a Hamas leader in the event is not against law," the SYM state president said.The SYM functionary alleged a plot to muzzle protests and voices. "Sangh parivar has been conspiring to label those standing with Palestine as terrorists by spreading false propaganda. By doing so, it is trying to suppress the public protests against India's support to Israel," Shuhaib said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

In California, a group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators made their way into the Port of Oakland and obstructed a US government ship, expressing their disapproval of America's support for Israel. The protest, which took place on a Friday morning, saw around 200 members of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center gather near The Cape Orlando, a merchant marine ship managed by the Department of Transportation. As port security shut the entrance, hundreds more joined the protest.The demonstrators, some of whom clung to a rope ladder to prevent the closing of a ship's door, chanted slogans like "Joe Biden, you can't hide, we charge you with genocide!"
 and displayed banners with messages such as "Biden, Pelosi: Don't Aid and Abet War Crimes, Ceasefire!" and "No US Military Aid to Israel."Despite attempts by a US Coast Guard negotiator to remove the protesters from the ship, they remained steadfast. Mohamed Shehk, one of the protesters, claimed the demonstration was peaceful and aimed to show solidarity with the Palestinian people.Abushamala, who was one of many demonstrators, said she lost several relatives in the war. "One missile killed three generations. An uncle, their son, and their child," Abushamala told CBS news. "I'm enraged that our government is still sending aid, missiles to Israel."This incident occurred following the House of Representatives' decision to approve $14.3 billion in federal aid to Israel, reallocating funds initially intended for the IRS under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. The bill passed with a majority vote, with only two Republicans opposing it.The Oakland Police Department and the US Coast Guard have not commented on whether any arrests were made during the protest.

Pro-Palestinian group shares map calling for 'intifada' in NYC

A group supporting the Palestinian cause shared a map of New York City newsrooms, businesses, and landmark buildings and called for "direct action" to "globalize intifada," New York Post reported.Within Our Lifetime, a Palestinian-led community organization, urged its followers to focus on targeting the offices of technology companies.“Each of the locations on this map reflects the location of an office of an enemy of both the Palestinian people and colonized people all over the world. Today and beyond, these locations will be sites for popular mobilization in defense of our people.”“May this map serve as a call for every struggle to act in their own interest. As we do so, we uplift one another’s struggles and free Palestine from the river to the sea,” it continued, repeating the Palestine Liberation Organization mantra adopted by Hamas that calls for the eradication of Israel.Reportedly, the post has since been deleted.“As Mayor [Eric] Adams has said repeatedly, hate has no place in our city,” a City Hall spokesperson said. “We are continually monitoring multiple channels to identify any potential threats to New York City. 
The NYPD is aware of a social media post urging ‘direct action’ towards several institutions in the city and is deploying resources to protect public safety at these locations. But to be clear, threatening businesses and organizations and referring to them as the ‘enemy’ is exactly the kind of hateful rhetoric that seeks to divide New Yorkers, but it won’t work, because we are better than that.”The group did not provide specific reasons for targeting those locations or details about the kind of action to be taken. However, New York lawmakers have criticized the map, asserting that it implies a potential for violenceUS Representative Ritchie Torres (D-NY) of the Bronx said on X Thursday that the messaging was an example of “Coded calls for violence against Jews” that are “proliferating on social media.”Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, also a Democrat, wrote that it was “dangerous and reprehensible.”“This is clear incitement against a group of predominantly Jewish institutions, based on the trope that they are ‘enemies’ of ‘colonized people all over the world.'”“I reject this hateful language and am grateful that the NYPD is taking this threat seriously, ” Levine added.According to the New York Post, councilman Keith Powers, who represents Manhattan Midtown wrote on X that the list was an “unacceptable invitation to senseless violence.“I strongly condemn it & have reached out to the local NYPD,” the Democrat wrote.Rabbi Joseph Potasnik, executive vice president of the NY Board of Rabbis, described the map as “a message that glorifies physical attacks against Jews.“Intifadas are targeted attacks on Jews,” New York Post quoted him as saying. “The hatred of the heart leads to hatred of the hands.”A City Hall spokesperson said the NYPD is deploying “resources to protect public safety” at the locations listed on the map.Meanwhile, Within Our Lifetime also hosted a “peaceful rally” in Washington Square Park to “demand an end to the current genocide and to call out universities who are complicit in it.”The New York Post said a poll found that more than one in five college students express support for Hamas in the conflict.

Jews, Palestinians, and Muslims in US alarmed by escalating hatred and bigotry

NEW DELHI: Communities in the United States are feeling a strong sense of fear and tension due to recent violent incidents linked to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Some are drawing parallels between the current situation and the atmosphere experienced in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, reported CNN."Every one of us feels unsafe," said Zein Rimawi, founder and member of the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge in south Brooklyn, New York, where three young men were attacked by a small pro-Israel cadre only days after the war started. "It's worse than after 9/11."The neighborhood activist, speaking to CNN, mentioned that he was living in Bay Ridge during the 2001 terrorist attacks. He recalled feeling scared at that time but also noted that he felt protected by political leaders because they defended American Muslims from discrimination.Regarding the reference to the Israel-Hamas conflict, it's important to clarify that there may be discrepancies in the number of casualties and events reported by different sources. The situation is complex, and numbers and details can vary.The events in the Middle East have had a ripple effect on major cities like New York. 
Advocates and community leaders are reporting a surge in hate-inspired incidents, with Jews, Palestinians, Muslims, and other groups being targeted in the aftermath of the initial attacks. Shockingly, in some cases, individuals have been singled out simply because they appeared to belong to one of these groups.It's crucial to note that New York City is home to one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel and also boasts one of the country's most substantial Muslim populations. After the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, FBI data showed that anti-Muslim motivated crimes became the second highest reported among religious-bias incidents, with anti-Jewish religion incidents being the highest.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) documented over 1,200 antisemitic incidents in the United States up to May 2023, following a previous record high in 2022. Since the recent conflict involving Hamas' attack in Israel, there has been an increase in antisemitic images and rhetoric. Nationally, the ADL has reported a 54% rise in antisemitic incidents compared to the same period last year, with 168 incidents occurring between October 7 and October 19.However, it's essential to understand that the reported numbers only provide a partial picture of the situation. An incident occurred on October 11 in Brooklyn's Bay Ridge neighborhood, known for its sizable Palestinian community. In this incident, a group of men, some of whom were carrying an Israeli flag, confronted three men on the street. They asked if these individuals were Palestinian and shouted offensive remarks such as "F**k Palestine, F**k Islam," as detailed in a criminal complaint.Regrettably, one of the victims needed medical attention following the attack, as mentioned in the complaint. Two of the attackers have been charged with assault and menacing as a hate crime, while four others remain at large, according to the complaint.On that very same day, a 19-year-old individual assaulted a 24-year-old student from Columbia University. The student was in the process of putting up posters containing information about Israeli casualties, as reported in the criminal complaint and local news. The 19-year-old forcefully removed the posters and used offensive language toward the student before physically striking them with a broomstick. Consequently, the 19-year-old faced charges of assault as a hate crime, along with other related charges, as outlined in the complaint.Then, on October 14, a 29-year-old woman experienced a troubling incident in the Grand Central subway station in Midtown Manhattan. The woman was punched in the face, and when she inquired why she was attacked, her assailant responded with "because you're Jewish," as per police reports. Subsequently, a 28-year-old man was arrested later in the week and faced charges of a hate crime and aggravated assault.A 6-year-old boy was tragically stabbed to death, and his mother suffered severe injuries in Plainfield Township, Illinois, near Chicago. The suspect, a 71-year-old who was their landlord, is believed to have targeted them due to their Muslim identity, in light of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East involving Hamas and the Israelis. The suspect has been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other charges.But while the numbers of reported incidents tick up, advocates say there are scores of others that never reach law enforcement."Who are you going to tell when somebody comes up to you and screams, 'Free Palestine,' at you?" said Richman, of the ADL. "Or there's a swastika that's been painted at your school? All kinds of incidents have been reported to us."Richman expressed that his office is facing significant challenges in managing the substantial increase in cases. He also anticipates that the number of incidents, both at the local and national levels, could rise further if Israeli ground troops become involved in Gaza."We know from experience that when there is a flare up in the Israel-Palestine, Israel-Hamas conflict, we see Jews are targeted in this country, in other countries, essentially being blamed for the actions of the Israeli government or the Israeli military," Richman said. "Nobody knows where anybody stands but people make assumptions because they are Jewish and then want to take out their anger on the Jewish community."According to CNN report, Ahmed Rehab, who serves as the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations' Chicago office, mentioned that his office usually receives four to six complaints a week from people who report being victims of mistreatment or bullying. However, since the beginning of the conflict just over two weeks ago, they've received a striking 86 complaints."My phone has been ringing off the hook," said Rehab, who added he believes the current situation is much worse now than it was after 9/11. Not only are people scared, Rehab says, but now, no one seems to want to hear from Muslim Americans."Palestinians are essentially dehumanized and there has been a conclusion that they deserve what's coming to them because of what's happened in Israel," said Rehab. "There isn't much appetite for the nuance that's needed to have the discussion of the value of human life and of a civilian life."Rehab, who was employed at a major accounting firm in Chicago during the 9/11 events, vividly recalls how his family and friends suffered from hate crimes in the aftermath of those attacks. He emphasized that individuals who are victims of bias incidents frequently choose not to report these crimes due to a mix of factors, including feeling that doing so may not lead to any meaningful change."There's a lot of 'toughen up,' especially in our culture," Rehab said. "There's also a sense of, 'I don't want to appear weak' or a sense of hopelessness that nothing will be done or can be done about it. Or there's a sense of bureaucracy. 'We've done this before,' and it just fizzles into bureaucracy."(via CNN report) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: In a Saturday post-match press conference following the Dallas Mavericks' game against the Milwaukee Bucks, NBA star Kyrie Irving made a notable statement by wearing a keffiyeh, a traditional Middle Eastern headdress often associated with Palestinian resistance. The gesture was a demonstration of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, where Israeli attacks since October 7 have resulted in significant casualties and widespread destruction.Despite Irving's impressive performance on the court, scoring 39 points in a game where the Dallas Mavericks suffered a 132-125 defeat against the Milwaukee Bucks at Fiserv Forum, the attention shifted to his choice of attire during the press conference.Kyrie Irving, an eight-time NBA All-Star, holds a prominent position in the league and notably secured the 2016 NBA title with the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
With 12 years of NBA experience, he has previously played for the Cavaliers, Boston Celtics, Brooklyn Nets, and made a move to the Mavericks earlier in 2023.It's worth noting that both the NBA and Irving's current team, the Mavericks, had previously expressed support for Israel in the wake of last month's attacks on the country by Hamas. On October 9, the NBA, in collaboration with the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), issued a statement mourning the loss of life in Israel and condemning acts of terrorism. The Mavericks had also affirmed their support for Israel a day prior to the NBA's official statement.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Jared Kushner, the son-in-law and ex-adviser to former President Donald Trump, said that American Jews might currently feel safer in Saudi Arabia than on some college campuses, citing a climate of protests and tensions related to the Israel-Hamas war. During an appearance on Fox News's "Sunday Morning Futures," Kushner remarked, "One of the ironies is that, as an American Jew, you're safer in Saudi Arabia right now than you are on a college campus like Columbia University. 
I spoke at the conference, and they allowed me to speak freely."The Israel-Hamas conflict has triggered protests and rallies on college campuses across the United States. Notably, hundreds of students held rallies at Columbia University in New York, where both supporters of Israel and Palestine voiced their opinions, leading to heightened tensions. In response to the unrest, Columbia University temporarily closed its campus as a safety precaution earlier this month.Meanwhile, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters poured onto the streets of Brooklyn, New York's largest district on Saturday to voice their anger at Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip.Home to between 1.6 and two million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Muslims, New York has for the past three weeks been rocked by demonstrations, rallies and vigils in support of the Palestinians and Israel.Hundreds of people were arrested Friday when police broke up a large demonstration of mostly Jewish New Yorkers who had taken over the main hall of Manhattan's Grand Central station in protest at Israel's bombardment of Gaza.

India's balancing act: Follow international law, fight terrorism; govt backs sovereign Palestine state

Amid fears of more bloodletting in the Israel-Hamas war and reports that Israeli forces may invade Gaza, India looked to put its position on the issue in perspective as it sought adherence to international humanitarian law while also urging the international community to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.In a delicate balancing act, as it broke its silence finally, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) reiterated India's support for a sovereign, independent and viable Palestine state while describing the Hamas assault on Israel that led to the present situation as terrorist attacks.India's response to the war, which has claimed over 1000 lives on both sides, was so far limited to PM Narendra Modi's condemnation of the Hamas assault on Israeli civilians as terrorist strikes and a show of solidarity with Israel.``There is a universal obligation to observe international humanitarian law. There is also a global responsibility to fight the menace of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,'' said spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.Counterterrorism is an integral part of India's foreign policy and Modi had expressed the same sentiment in his conversation with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week. The reference though to international humanitarian law, which is applicable in conflicts and differentiates non-combatants and medical aid workers from the military, is an indication of India's evolving position on the issue.The reaction - in response to media queries - followed reports that Israel will not allow any ``humanitarian exception'' to its siege of Gaza till Hamas frees all the hostages. 
India's position has been nuanced as, unlike China, it has also not called for a ceasefire because it doesn't want to seem disapproving of Israel's retaliatory strikes on Hamas terrorists given India's own experience with cross-border terrorism. However, it also doesn't want to endorse any action that might be seen as a collective punishment for the Palestinians. When asked about India's position on the Palestine issue, the spokesperson said India's policy in this regard had been long standing and consistent. ``India has always advocated the resumption of direct negotiations towards establishing a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine living within secure and recognized borders, side by side at peace with Israel,'' said the official.While many see India's strategic partnership and close defence and security ties with Israel as having diminished India's relationship with Israel, the Modi government publicly continues to maintain that India's support for the Palestinian cause is integral to its foreign policy.Follow live updates When asked how India look at Hamas, which has been designated as a terrorist organisation by the US, the foreign ministry said India had been very clear that the assault by the group on Israel was a terrorist attack. India, which provides development support to Palestine and also helps Palestinian refugees with an annual contribution to the UN of $ 5 million, has also not yet announced any humanitarian aid for the Palestinians caught in the Gaza siege.

Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah addressed people across Middle East on Friday. As per the report by the Telegraph, Nasrallah started off by distancing himself, Hezbollah and Iran from having anything to do with the October 7 strike on Israel. 
It was “100 per cent Palestinian,” he said, and it was planned in “great secrecy”.“This great, large-scale operation was purely the result of Palestinian planning and implementation”, Nasrallah was reported as saying.He also warned about preventing a preemptive strike against Hezbollah in Lebanon. “I tell the Israelis, if you are considering carrying out a preemptive attack against Lebanon, it will be the most foolish mistake you make in your entire existence,” he said.Telegraph also quoted former Mossad intelligence officer Sima Shine as saying "He (Nasrallah) said it was a war Israel can not win, something that signals Hezbollah’s intervention is not needed.” According to report, other analysts at the Israel’s Institute of National Security Studies, noted that it also meant Nasrallah was “leaving his options open”.Nasrallah also accused Israel of committing a “complete brutality” of the Palestinian people and said the US was responsible for the deaths of civilians, according to the Hill.“The whole world is witnessing thousands of women and children being killed,” he said. “Today, defending the people of Gaza is an act of humanity.” For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

IUML holds massive pro-Palestine rally, Thangal calls Israel a terror state

KOZHIKODE: Tens of thousands of people converged on Kozhikode beach on Thursday afternoon in the largest pro-Palestine rally to take place in the country which was organized by IUML ever since the Israel- Palestine conflict.Chanting 'Solidarity with Palestine' and 'Down with Zionism' and holding banners which were written even in Arabic which read 'Indians with Palestine', 'End the Genocide in Gaza', IUML activists, including hundreds of women, formed a sea of humanity along the beach.Inaugurating the rally, IUML state president Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal said that Israel was the biggest terrorist nation in the world and added that the Indian government was trying to whitewash Israel. Thangal said that while all the Prime Ministers from Jawaharlal Nehru to Manmohan Singh, including even A B Vajpayee, had sided with justice and had taken a stand against Israeli occupation of Palestine, the current central government was trying to dilute that stand and whitewash Israel.However, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who was the chief guest at the function, in his keynote address 'tacitly' referred to Hamas as terrorists which prompted a response from IUML leader M K Muneer."Terrorists attacked Israel on October 7 and killed 1,400 people and took 200 as hostages and in retaliation Israel has killed over 6,000 people in the bombings carried out in Gaza which has still not stopped," Tharoor said, however, adding that the Israeli response to the attack was disproportionate and in contravention of the human rights conventions."When the terrorists killed innocent children and women, the world condemned it. 
Now, we the world, including all of us, are condemning the Israeli bombings as well," Tharoor said.However, Tharoor's remarks prompted a response from Muneer. Without naming Tharoor, Muneer said in his speech that when Bhagat Singh and Subhas Chandra Bose fought for the independence of the country, their actions were termed as extremism and terrorism by the British and likewise the fight for independence of Palestine in Gaza is being portrayed by the imperial forces as terrorism. "It is fight for independence by Palestinians but what Israel is doing is ethnic genocide. We are with the resistance of the people of Palestine, and we should be able to identify between resistance and attack," Muneer said."Just because this rally is organized by IUML, one should not think that it is a Muslim issue. It is a human rights issue. The bombs fall on people irrespective of their religion," Tharoor said, adding that it might well be one of the most important political rallies seen in India and perhaps across the world in defence of human rights and in favour of peace.The rally began with Sadikali Thangal reciting prayers for peace in Palestine. IUML national secretary P K Kunhalikutty presided over. IUML had also intended to make the rally party's show of strength and the influence the Thangal family holds among the Muslim community. The party had not invited any of the Muslim organisations, including Samastha. However Samastha frontal organization leader Nazer Faizi Koodathayi attended the programme.

NEW DELHI: Israeli troops have ventured more than 2 miles into the Gaza Strip, unfurling their national flag in the Palestinian territory for the first time in nearly two decades. According to the New York Post, the event was captured in a recently surfaced video and marks a significant moment in the Israel-Hamas conflict.Images of Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers waving the Israeli flag inside Gaza were disseminated on social media by Israel Hayo, a Jewish media outlet. The display unfolded on Saturday evening, just as Israel was gearing up for a full-scale invasion of Gaza.In the video, a soldier from the 52nd Battalion of the 401st Brigade can be heard declaring, "Soldiers of the 52 Battalion of the 401 Brigade are waving the Israeli flag in the heart of Gaza by the beach. 
We will not forgive nor forget, and we’ll not stop until the victory."As per reports in the New York Post, this symbolic act is believed to be the first instance of the Israeli flag flying over a portion of Gaza since 2005. Back then, Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territory were dismantled and evacuated, as reported by the Jerusalem Post.As of now, both the IDF and Hamas have refrained from issuing official statements regarding the video.Contrary to claims that the flag was planted "in the heart of Gaza," CNN, through geolocation analysis, traced the video to a location in northern Gaza, approximately 2 miles from the border.Palestinian journalist Younis Tirawi echoed this finding, suggesting that the video was recorded near the Bianco Resort along the Mediterranean Sea.This development unfolds amid Israel's preparation for a full-scale ground assault on Gaza. The Israeli government's decision comes in response to recent violence initiated by Hamas, which claimed the lives of over 1,400 people in the region on October 7. Palestinian death toll from the three-week war has risen past 8,000, according to Gaza's health ministry. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Two student groups that organized protests on the Israel-Hamas war were suspended in Columbia university on Friday. According to the prestigious US university, this decision was taken because the protests 'included threatening rhetoric and intimidation.'According to , Columbia University's chair of the special committee on campus safety, Gerald Rosberg said that the Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace would be suspended throughout the fall.In a statement Rosberg said,"This decision was made after the two groups repeatedly violated University policies related to holding campus events, culminating in an unauthorized event Thursday afternoon that proceeded despite warnings and included threatening rhetoric and intimidation.He further added that the suspension would only be lifted if the two groups showed the will to comply with campus regulation.Describing the current scenario as 'charged time', Rosberg said that this action will ensure safety of the community and that core activities can be conducted without disruption in the campus.According to media reports, hundreds of Columbia students had walked out of lectures on Thursday to attend a protest organized by the two groups. It is reported that during the protests the students called on Washington to push for a ceasefire in Israel's assault on the Palestinian group Hamas.The Israeli operation to destroy Hamas has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry.According to media reports students at the Thursday protest called for the school to label Israel's assault on Gaza a 'genocide,' and demanded the university to boycott and divest frm israeli institutions.It is notable that the Middle East conflict has brought an ideological divide between the students in the American campuses. 
Earlier groups including Israeli universities and US Republicans have accused many US campuses of becoming hotbeds of anti-Semitism.Earlier Harvard, Stanford and New York University also witnessed bitter clashes involving students, professors and administrators. these clashes have blown up into viral debates on social media and charges of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and threats to free speech For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Mahmoud Musa, one of the individuals convicted in the 2021 Times Square assault on a Jewish man, caused a disturbance during his sentencing on Tuesday at Manhattan Supreme Court, reported New York Post. The 23-year-old, sentenced to seven years for attacking Joseph Borgen during a clash between Israel and Palestinian supporters, shouted "Free Palestine" twice as he was led back to a holding cell.The courtroom descended into chaos as Musa's supporters accused Judge Felicia Mennin of racism. Court officers had to intervene, escorting Musa's backers out as tensions flared. 
Borgen, 31, and over 50 supporters, donned in "Justice For Joey" hats, remained behind.Borgen, delivering a powerful victim-impact statement during the hearing, recounted the day of the attack, describing how Musa and others pursued him, launching a violent assault. The assailants pepper-sprayed him, hurled antisemitic slurs, and left him with lasting physical and psychological trauma.Musa, along with co-defendant Mohammed Othman, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault as a hate crime. Prosecutors sought sentences between 3 1/2 to 15 years, with Assistant District Attorney Jonathon Junig recommending 6 1/2 years for Musa. Junig argued that the attack was premeditated, evidenced by text messages planning the assault.Defense attorney Lance Lazzaro claimed Musa was influenced by a family narrative and criticized Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for pursuing jail sentences. Lazzaro argued that Musa's actions were shaped by growing up in a Palestinian family.Musa defended himself, asserting he went to Times Square to support Palestine emotionally, denying intent for a hate crime. Another defendant, Mohammed Said Othman, and Faisal Elezzi faced sentencing, with the former set for December 12. Elezzi, initially promised probation, received a 60-day prison sentence for illegal pot sales.Waseem Awawdeh, previously stating he would "do it again," received an 18-month sentence earlier. Borgen, expressing relief at the court proceedings' conclusion, emphasized the significance of holding perpetrators accountable for hate crimes, signaling that such actions would not be treated lightly in New York City. District Attorney Bragg affirmed the importance of accountability, noting Borgen's ongoing trauma and the hope for continued healing. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: In another balancing act on the Israel-Hamas conflict, foreign minister S Jaishankar spoke to his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian on Sunday and underlined the importance of efforts to prevent the situation from deteriorating further and to ensure humanitarian aid for Palestine.“Discussed the grave situation in West Asia and the concern of the international community. Conveyed the importance of preventing escalation and providing humanitarian support. 
Agreed to stay in touch,” said Jaishankar on X .Jaishankar did not mention the issue of terrorism while putting out the details of his conversation. India has strongly condemned the October 7 strikes by Hamas on Israel as terrorist attacks and both PM Narendra Modi and Jaishankar have reiterated the same in their engagements with leaders on the conflict. Iran, however, remains a key overseas benefactor of Hamas and its state media confirmed Sunday that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had met Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.Haniyeh was said to have briefed Khamenei about the latest developments in the Gaza Strip and ``the crimes of the Zionist regime in Gaza, as well as the developments in the West Bank”. Khamenei “emphasized Tehran’s consistent policy of supporting the Palestinian resistance forces against the Zionist occupiers”.In a conversation with Jaishankar on Saturday, Israel foreign minister Eli Cohen had described Hamas as a despicable terrorist organisation worse than ISIS. Despite their close cooperation on security issues, there’s a fundamental difference between the positions India and Israel have on terrorism. While Israel sees Iran as the fountainhead of all terrorism, India’s foreign policy has that characterisation reserved only for Pakistan. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

KOZHIKODE: Senior Congress leader K Muraleedharan has demanded that CWC member Shashi Tharoor should correct the remark he had made on the Israel-Palestine conflict at the IUML's Palestine solidarity rally on October 26.Muraleedharan told mediapersons in Kozhikode on Sunday that Congress does not approve of Tharoor's that particular remark and said the party's stand is that what happened on October 7 was not a terror attack."It should be viewed as an expression of the emotions of a set of people who have been enduring suffering for long. Everything that happened after that has been attempts to annihilate an entire population. Instead of ensuring that all people stand together, CPM is trying to open a 'shop of divisiveness' in the state," he said.Muraleedharan said Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala had made it clear in no uncertain terms the stand of the party in Kozhikode recently.He added that CPM was trying to divide the people of the state who are united on the issue and added what chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said at the CPM's Palestine Solidarity Meet in Kozhikode on Saturday was absolutely false."He (Tharoor) should correct the sentence he had made on his own. 
It is responsible for all these issues. I expect he would do that," Muraleedharan said and asked whether Vijayan would correct the remarks made by CPM central committee member K K Shailaja."Creating an issue over just this (Tharoor's remark) is aimed at making political gains," he said.Muraleedharan said a correction by Tharoor would end the issue as there won't be anything left to blame on the Congress.Asked whether Tharoor would be invited to the Palestine solidarity rally organised by the Congress at the Kozhikode beach on November 23, he said it was up to the organizing committee to decide."I have been invited and I will be attending the event. I don't know who else has been invited. But I came to know of Tharoor saying he has some inconvenience on that day," Muraleedharan said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Amid escalating tensions between Israel and Palestine, a group of opposition leaders including former Union ministers and sitting and former MPs met the Palestinian ambassador to India, Adnan Mohammad Jaber Abualhayjaa, and said the international community must strive for a peaceful resolution to the Israel-Palestine war and pressure must be exerted on Israel to "abide by international laws and respect rights of the Palestinian people".The group, comprising former Union ministers Mani Shankar Aiyar and Shrikant Jena, BSP MP Danish Ali, RJD MP Manoj Jha, SP MP Javed Ali, JDU's KC Tyagi, CPI chief D Raja, CPM leader Nilotpal Basu, SP leader Shahid Siddiqui, and CPIML's Dipankar Bhattacharya, among others, also pressed for "intensified diplomatic efforts" and "multilateral initiatives" to restore lasting peace in the war-torn region."We strongly condemn the indiscriminate bombing of Palestinians in Gaza by Israel, which we believe amounts to an attempt to genocide. We urge an immediate cessation of all hostilities to prevent further loss of innocent lives and the destruction of homes and infrastructure," the leaders said in a representation to the ambassador.

India condemns terrorism, stands with Israel: PM Modi to Bibi

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday again expressed solidarity with Israel saying the people of India stood firmly with the Jewish state, as his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu called to brief him about the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas war. Modi reiterated India's condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.In the phone conversation, Modi also highlighted the issue of safety and security of Indian citizens in Israel and Netanyahu assured him of full support and cooperation in that regard, according to the Indian government. There are 18,000 Indian nationals in Israel, including 900 students. 
"I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his phone call and providing an update on the ongoing situation. People of India stand firmly with Israel in this difficult hour. India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations," Modi wrote on X, shortly after the conversation.On Saturday, after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, Modi had described the offensive as terrorist attacks while expressing condolences to the innocent victims and their families. In his talks with the Israeli PM on Tuesday, Modi again expressed deep condolences and sympathy for those killed and wounded as a result of the terrorist attacks in Israel. The leaders agreed to remain in close touch. India's response to the conflict in West Asia so far has been limited to Modi's tweets and a readout of his conversation with the Israeli PM. Aware of the sensitivities involved at home, the government has been careful to not publicly offer any support to Israel but, unlike China, it has also not sought an immediate ceasefire.Modi is known to share a close rapport with the Israeli PM and was hoping to host him later this year. Netanyahu was also the PM when Modi, in 2017, travelled to Israel for the first ever visit by an Indian PM to the country. Amid efforts by the Modi government for "de-hyphenation" of India's ties with Israel and Palestine, the India-Israel relationship was also upgraded to a strategic partnership during that visit.Modi, however, also became the first Indian PM the very next year to visit Palestine and his government continues to maintain that India's backing of the Palestinian cause is an "integral" part of its foreign policy. India officially continues to support a negotiated solution resulting in a "sovereign, independent, viable and united" Palestine state, at peace with Israel.Looking to mobilise support for the Israel counter-offensive, which has seen its forces pound the Gaza strip with air strikes, Netanyahu has spoken to many world leaders in the past few days. These include the leaders of France, Germany, UK, Italy and Ukraine, apart from US President Joe Biden. As Israel has said, all of them expressed "unreserved" support for Israel's right to defend itself.Netanyahu's assurance about the safety and security of Indians is significant as a large number of Indians continue to live in Israel. According to the external affairs ministry, there are about 18,000 Indian citizens in Israel, primarily caregivers employed by Israeli elders, diamond traders, IT professionals and students. Tourism between the two countries has also received a boost with Air India since 2018 operating five flights every week between Delhi and Tel Aviv. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

The phrase "from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free" has become a contentious slogan in American politics, particularly following its use by Representative Rashida Tlaib. While some view it as a call for Palestinian freedom and rights, others, especially within the Jewish community, see it as a call for the destruction of the state of Israel.For many Palestinians, the phrase symbolizes a struggle for equality and coexistence across the region that encompasses Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, stretching from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. However, its use by Tlaib has sparked a backlash from Jewish Democrats who find the slogan hurtful and potentially hateful.Tlaib is also one of the most vocal critics of Israel's occupation and human rights violations, and a supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which seeks to pressure Israel to end its occupation and comply with international law. Tlaib posted a video on X, formerly Twitter, on October 29, 2023, accusing President Joe Biden of supporting "genocide" in Gaza, and urging him to support a ceasefire or lose the support of the American people in the 2024 election. 
She also used the slogan "from the river to the sea" in her tweet, which she later defended as an "aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate".Tlaib's tweet has drawn condemnation from both Republicans and Democrats, who have accused her of spreading anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli rhetoric, and of undermining the US alliance with Israel. Some of her Democratic colleagues from Michigan have asked her to retract her tweet, saying it was "hurtful" and "insensitive" to Jewish people. A pro-Israel Democratic group has also released an ad in Detroit attacking Tlaib for her stance on the Israel-Hamas war, and pointing to her previous votes against bills and resolutions that supported Israel's security and right to self-defense. Additionally, a group of Republican lawmakers, led by Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, have filed a resolution to censure Tlaib for her tweet, but the House voted to table it on November 1, 2023.The origins of the slogan trace back to the 1960s, when Palestinians sought a single secular, democratic state across the entire land historically known as "Palestine." This vision implied the dismantling of Israel as a Jewish state, with the expectation that Jewish people might leave once it ceased to be a Jewish ethnostate.The slogan has also been associated with Hamas, the Islamist militant group and political party that has governed Gaza since 2007. In its 2017 charter, Hamas calls for the liberation of Palestine "from the river to the sea," rejecting any alternative. The slogan is also seen by many Israelis and Jewish Americans as a call for the elimination of Israel as a Jewish state, and a threat to its existence and security.According to an Inside report, the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group with a pronounced pro-Israel stance, asserts that this is essentially a demand for a Palestinian nation spanning from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, an area encompassing the State of Israel, which would necessitate the dissolution of the Jewish state. "It is an anti-Semitic allegation that negates the Jewish people's right to self-determination, including the expulsion of Jews from their historical homeland."In a similar vein, the American Jewish Committee contends that while advocating for a Palestinian state is not inherently anti-Semitic, the slogan in question is deemed anti-Semitic because it advocates for the "eradication of the Jewish state."
