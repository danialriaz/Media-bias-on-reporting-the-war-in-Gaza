What Israel plans to do once it drives out Hamas from Gaza
The Times of India (TOI)

NEW DELHI: Offering a glimpse into what Israel plans to do after 'eradicating' Hamas from the Gaza Strip, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that “Israel will for an indefinite period have overall security responsibility in Gaza, because we have seen what happens when we do not have it."How Israel intends to handle Gaza’s postwar future remains an open and burning question as Israeli forces push deeper into the enclave amid a campaign to eliminate the Hamas terror group, which has ruled the Strip for over 15 years.Speaking to US news channel ABC on Monday, Netanyahu rejected US advise to  pullback its troops from Gaza after it ousts Hamas.He pointed to Hamas’s killing of over 1,400 people and its seizure of over 240 captives when it infiltrated Israel’s southern border on October 7, as the reason why Israeli security control of Gaza was important.“When we do not have that security responsibility what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we could not imagine,” said Netanyahu.Will Israel put Gaza under military control again?Netanyahu did not offer details on what Israeli security oversight in Gaza would entail. Israel has insisted that it does not intend to reoccupy the enclave but Netanyahu’s comment, which confirmed similar statements offered by Israeli officials in recent weeks, could point to plans for what may amount to an extended military occupation of the Strip, home to over 2 million Palestinians.Israel had militarily controlled Gaza from 1967 until its withdrawal from the territory in 2005.United States secretary of state Antony Blinken said last week it was his understanding that Israel did not want to control Gaza. 
"Israel cannot reassume control and responsibility for Gaza," Blinken said, adding: “Israel has made clear it has no intention or desire to do that.”The US has repeatedly asked Israel to come up with a long-term plan of who will take power in Gaza once Hamas is removed.EU chief's five-point planEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen reiterated that "there can be no long-term Israeli security presence in Gaza", adding that “Gaza is an essential part of any future Palestinian State".Von der Leyen said these stances were part of a five-point plan for Gaza after the war. The plan, rooted in the concept of a two-state solution, seeks to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza while working towards a lasting resolution. The principles state that Gaza must not serve as a terror haven; should not be under Hamas’s control; should be free from long-term Israeli security presence; should see no forced displacement of Palestinians; and should not be under a perpetual blockade.Abbas may take control of GazaMany analysts believe that Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority (PA), under Mahmoud Abbas, will most likely be asked to take control of the Strip.The PA, which currently controls the West Bank, was ousted by Hamas from Gaza in 2007. On November 5, Blinken made a suprise visit to the West Bank and met Abbas, who said the PA could return to power in Gaza only if a “comprehensive political solution” is found to the Israel-Palestine conflict.“We will fully assume our responsibilities within the framework of a comprehensive political solution that includes all of the [occupied] West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip,” Abbas was quoted as telling Blinken by the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.In what appeared to be the most direct US position since the start of the war on October 7, Blinken told Abbas the PA should play a central role in the future of Gaza.

US campuses grappling with violence and threats amid Israel-Hamas conflict

Amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, American campuses are grappling with challenges related to student safety, identity-based tensions, and the balance between open scholarship and activism, reported Independent. Incidents ranging from protest melees to death threats have erupted across US universities.In a recent viral video from Cooper Union College, Jewish students found themselves locked inside a library as pro-Palestine demonstrators chanted outside. The clash unfolded after pro-Israel students initially joined a counter-protest, leading to heightened tensions.Instances of violence and threats have escalated. 
A Cornell University junior, Patrick Dai, was arrested for allegedly making violent threats against the school's Jewish population. Similar incidents, including an assault at Columbia University, reflect a troubling rise in antisemitic and anti-Muslim incidents.The Anti-Defamation League reports a 400% increase in antisemitic incidents in the US since the conflict's onset. The FBI attributes about 60% of all religious-based hate crimes to antisemitic acts, emphasizing the severity of the situation.The White House is actively involved, collaborating with the Department of Justice and Homeland Security to address hate-related campus threats. Universities, including Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania, are convening to counter antisemitism in higher education.However, concerns arise over limitations on free speech and campus activism. Recent incidents, such as the questioning of students at Bloomfield Hills High School, suggest challenges in navigating the fine line between expression and perceived threats. The slogan "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free" has sparked controversy, with some seeing it as a direct threat, leading to demands for student expulsions.Pro-Palestinian groups, such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), face scrutiny and closures at Florida universities. Columbia University suspended SJP and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), citing policy violations and unapproved events with threatening rhetoric.The tensions extend beyond campuses, with political and financial consequences. Individuals expressing views critical of Israel face doxxing and career repercussions. The wider debate over academic freedom intensifies as calls to remove professors, like Joseph Massad at Columbia University, raise concerns about stifling essential discussions.In this charged atmosphere, finding a constructive dialogue becomes crucial, not only for the well-being of students and academics but also for addressing broader geopolitical concerns, given the US's role as Israel's key security ally.

'It is not Israel that is...': Netanyahu reacts to Trudeau criticism on babies being killed in Gaza

NEW DELHI: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the ongoing violence in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, marking his sharpest criticism of Israel since the conflict with Hamas began over a month ago. His Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu reacted strongly, saying it is Hamas that should be held accountable.While Canada acknowledges Israel's right to self-defense, Trudeau expressed growing concern over the rising death toll in Gaza and urged Israel to halt the killing of women, children, and babies. 
Speaking during a news conference in British Columbia, Trudeau said, "I urge the government of Israel to exercise maximum restraint. The world is watching, on TV, on social media - we're hearing the testimonies of doctors, family members, survivors, kids who have lost their parents," he said. "The world is witnessing this killing of women, of children, of babies. This has to stop."Responding to the denunciation, Netanyahu said, "It is not Israel that is deliberately targeting civilians but Hamas that beheaded, burned and massacred civilians in the worst horrors perpetrated on Jews since the Holocaust.""While Israel is doing everything to keep civilians out of harm’s way, Hamas is doing everything to keep them in harm’s way. Israel provides civilians in Gaza humanitarian corridors and safe zones, Hamas prevents them from leaving at gunpoint. It is Hamas not Israel that should be held accountable for committing a double war crime - targeting civilians while hiding behind civilians. The forces of civilization must back Israel in defeating Hamas barbarism," he added.Trudeau had also called on Hamas to cease using Palestinians as human shields and to release all hostages. He highlighted the precarious situation at Gaza's Al Shifa Hospital, where 36 babies' lives were at risk due to a lack of clear mechanisms for evacuation, despite Israeli efforts to provide incubators.In addition to addressing the humanitarian crisis, Trudeau noted that around 350 Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and their family members had been successfully evacuated from Gaza. Last week, he had previously called for a significant humanitarian pause in the conflict to facilitate the release of hostages and ensure the delivery of adequate aid to meet civilian needs.In the latest updates in the Middle East, Israel said its forces have entered Gaza’s Shifa hospital, which has hundreds of patients and medical personnel inside. Israeli forces were conducting a 'precise' operation against Hamas in a specific area of the complex while taking steps to avoid harm to civilians.Israel accuses Hamas of using hospitals as cover for its fighters, alleging that Hamas has set up its main command center in and beneath Shifa hospital, the largest in the besieged territory. Both Hamas and Shifa hospital staff deny the Israeli allegations.Fighting between Israeli troops and Palestinian militants in northern Gaza has caused 2,00,000 people to flee south in the past 10 days. More than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began.  Meanwhile, around 1,200 people in Israel died, most of them in the Hamas attack on October 7, and about 240 hostages were taken from Israel into Gaza. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

World Cup, Australia vs Pakistan: Black T-shirts blacked out to thwart protest bid at Chinnaswamy stadium

BENGALURU: Police at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Friday red-flagged spectators wearing black T-shirts, jackets and caps. Just before Pakistan's World Cup match against Australia, there was chaos at the entry points to some of the stands on Queens Road and Cubbon Road after police told spectators in black attire to change into clothing of some other colour before entering the stadium.According to police sources, possibilities of pro-Palestine demonstrations by a section of spectators at the stadium prompted enforcement of this last-minute 'dress code'.Aditya Venkataram was among those whose T-shirt made it to a pile of black outfits outside the stadium."There was no advisory as to any colour restriction for the match. It was absurd that the police told me to wear a T-shirt of a colour other than black and remove my black cap. I had bought an India jersey and wore it on my black T-shirt, but they wouldn't allow me entry until I discarded the black T-shirt," the 21-year-old said.Police check banners & placards at stadiumHigher ups inda order bandide (orders from the higher ups)," was all a policeman on duty would share when asked about this sudden diktat against black clothing. 
"There should have been some sort of a communication. It seemed like fans were being treated as an afterthought. It wasn't like we were trying to create trouble," said Purujit Ponnappa, a chartered accountant, who too was forced to discard his black T-shirt. Women sporting black tops too were told to change into a different colour before they could enter.A senior police officer, who did not want to be named, told TOI: "There were intelligence inputs about some pro-Palestine supporters having decided to condemn the Israeli attack on Palestine by wearing black [at the stadium during the match]." He further said: "There were messages doing the rounds on social media with appeals to participate in a demonstration during the match and thereby draw global attention. It was in this backdrop that instructions were issued to officers deployed in and around the stadium to not allow those wearing black." Even banners and placards were checked for any message with a political or pro-Palestine overture before those were allowed inside.The security checks were not totally out of place, though, as some people did come to the stadium with Palestinian flags painted on their faces. While some managed to sneak past security unnoticed, few others were told to wash their faces before being allowed entry to the stands.Police, however, clarified that they did not impose any blanket ban on black clothing and were only trying to screen likely mischief-mongers.While senior citizens in black were allowed inside, youngsters were told to remove black T-shirts, jackets and caps before entering the stadium, police said. Pakistan team jerseys were sparingly available at the match venue, but many who managed to get those were turned away at the gate."I was told I won't be allowed to enter, wearing a Pakistan jersey. So, I bought a Chennai Super Kings jersey from a street vendor and had to discard the Pakistan jersey I was initially wearing," rued Rakshak, a Babar Azam fan. Police, though, refuted complaints that Pakistani jerseys were not allowed into the stadium. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Thousands of people in Gaza sought to heed Israel's order to evacuate roughly the northern half of the territory, while others huddled at hospitals in the north on Sunday. Gaza is struggling for food, water and safety, and braced for a looming invasion a week after Hamas militants launched a deadly assault on Israel.Israeli forces, supported by a growing deployment of US warships in the region, positioned themselves along Gaza's border and drilled for what Israel said would be a campaign by air, land and sea to dismantle the militant group. Israel dropped leaflets over Gaza City in the north and renewed warnings on social media, ordering more than 1 million Gaza residents to move south.Here are the latest developmentsHamas confirms 3 fighters killed infiltrating Israel from LebanonHamas claimed responsibility Sunday for two infiltrations from Lebanon to Israel that killed three of its fighters, as war rages between the Gaza-based militants and Israel.The Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' armed wing, said its members were "able... to blow up the border fence and... go forth inside occupied Palestine," clashing with "the enemy", whose planes targeted the fighters, killing three on Saturday.Israeli forces on Saturday had said they killed several "terrorists" trying to cross from Lebanon.In their statement, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades also claimed responsibility for an incident on Friday at the border when the group "advanced to go forth into occupied Palestine and was able to clash with the Zionist enemy army and withdraw peacefully," on Friday.Blinken says meeting with Saudi Crown Prince was productiveUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said his meeting in Riyadh with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was "very productive".Blinken was answering a shouted question from a Reuters reporter as he returned to the hotel the US delegation was staying at. 
A US official said his meeting with the Kingdom's de-facto ruler lasted a little under an hour.Israeli communications minister seeks shutdown of Al Jazeera bureauIsrael's communications minister said on Sunday he was seeking cabinet approval for a proposed closure of Al Jazeera's local bureau, and accused the Qatari news station of pro-Hamas incitment and of exposing Israeli soldiers to potential attack from Gaza.Palestinian deaths soar past 2,300, making it deadliest of five wars for GazaThe Gaza health ministry says 2,329 Palestinians have been killed since the latest fighting erupted, making this the deadliest of the five Gaza wars for Palestinians.The death toll on Sunday surpassed that of the third war between Israel and Hamas, in the summer of 2014, when 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, were killed, according to UN figures.That war lasted six weeks, and 74 people were killed on the Israeli side, including six civilians.Biden calls Israel's PM Netanyahu, Palestinian president AbbasPresident Joe Biden reiterated the US' unwavering support for Israel and emphasised the need for humanitarian aid for the people of Palestine as he held separate phone calls with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders amid escalating tensions in Gaza, the White House has said.In his first call with Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas since Hamas' unprecedented assault on Israel a week ago, Biden stressed that the militant group "does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination".Biden discussed with Abbas US' efforts to work with the United Nations, Egypt, Jordan, Israel and others to ensure humanitarian supplies reach civilians in Gaza.The President also called Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his fifth such call Hamas' assault last week.In both calls, Biden stressed the need to prevent the conflict from expanding.

Jewish billionaire Henry Swieca quits Columbia Business School board over rise of antisemitism

NEW DELHI: Jewish billionaire Henry Swieca, founder of Talpion Fund Management, stepped down from the Columbia Business School board on October 30 citing “an expression of deep concern for the direction in which the university is heading” as the reason, as reported by Fox News. He wrote, “With blatantly anti-Jewish student groups and professors allowed to operate with complete impunity, it sends a clear and distressing message that Jews are not just unwelcome, but also unsafe on campus”.According to him, “the reputation and integrity” of the institution have become “significantly compromised by a moral cowardice that appears beyond repair.” In a statement to Spectator, a spokesperson of the Business School confirmed his resignation.The spokesperson stated, “Columbia Business School received a letter from Henry Swieca on October 30 announcing his resignation from the Board, and the administration thanked him for his service to the School”.At the time of Swieca's resignation, Columbia's Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace had arranged two pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The first protest took place on October 12 and a subsequent walkout on October 26. Swieca expressed in his resignation letter that statements from the University condemning antisemitism on campus lack credibility and “any other minority group on campus would never have to face anything close to this level of intimidation and hatred of Jewish and pro-Israel students”. University President Minouche Shafik issued multiple statements addressing the increase in antisemitic and Islamophobic hate speech. 
Shafik wrote, “Unfortunately, some are using this moment to spread antisemitism, Islamophobia, bigotry against Palestinians and Israelis, and various other forms of hate. Especially at a time of pain and anger, we must avoid language that vilifies, threatens, or stereotypes entire groups of people.”Swieca is also part of a group of Jewish alumni and donors who have decided to withdraw their support from Columbia. This group includes billionaire Leon Cooperman, Business ’67, who recently declared his decision to cease donations to the University.Swieca's name is no longer listed on Columbia Business School's website or its roster of board members. Talpion's website notes that Swieca is the son of Holocaust survivors and highlights several charitable organisations he supports. These include the American Israel Education Fund (affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and Meor (a program focused on Jewish heritage study), and Columbia University.

Maryland anti-hate crime official under fire for anti-semitic posts

Zainab Chaudry, the director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations' (CAIR) Maryland office and a member of the Maryland Commission on Hate Crime Response and Prevention, is faced backlash over antisemitic social media posts, reported Fox News.Chaudry made statements questioning the authenticity of babies killed in a Hamas attack, comparing Israel to Nazi Germany, and suggesting the existence of Israel as the cause of the ongoing conflict.Despite the posts, Chaudry remains on the hate crime commission, nominated by Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown.Chaudry accuses the Israeli government of wanting to commit genocide against Palestinians but emphasizes her condemnation of violence against both Israelis and Palestinians.The Maryland Commission on Hate Crime Response and Prevention, focused on addressing hate crime incidents across the state, has distanced itself from Chaudry's views. Jennifer Donelan, a spokesperson for Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, clarified that individual commission members' opinions do not reflect the views of the commission or the attorney general. The commission aims to explore the impact of events in the Middle East on the community, develop policies, and promote understanding of diverse perspectives.Zainab defended her posts, stating that a "Nazi post" was initially shared by a close Jewish friend. 
She accused the Israeli government of making genocidal threats and condemned Benjamin Netanyahu's government for alleged war crimes. Zainab claims to stand against all forms of hate, including antisemitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Palestinian racism, asserting that false accusations will not deter her from advocating for justice.The situation has raised concerns about Zainab's continued role on the hate crime commission, given the controversial nature of her statements and their potential impact on fostering understanding and tolerance within the community. The commission's response to these concerns will be crucial in determining how it navigates differing viewpoints and maintains its mission in addressing hate and bias incidents across Maryland.

NEW DELHI: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced backlash over Ottawa's stand on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war as some people booed him during his undisclosed mosque visit in Toronto.During Trudeau's visit to a mosque in the Etobicoke area, people were heard saying "shame" and urging a facilitator not to let Trudeau speak at the podium, reported The Toronto Sun citing Global News.    This comes days after the Liberal MPs expressed a wide array of views on the ongoing battle between Israel and Hamas, with several calling for a ceasefire.Toronto-area Liberal MP Salma Zahid, who is chair of the Canada-Palestine Parliamentary Friendship Group, said Friday that she worked with 33 MPs to send a letter to the prime minister that laid out certain demands, reported The Toronto Sun.The letter was signed by 23 backbench Liberal MPs, eight NDP MPs and both Green Party MPs. It sought Canada to join the call for an immediate ceasefire, help facilitate the opening of a humanitarian corridor and stand up for international law."International law is clear that innocent civilians and all those not taking part in the fighting must on no account be attacked and must be spared and protected," the letter read as per the news outlet.According to The Toronto Sun, Liberal MPs in Canada are joining calls by Muslim groups for Canada to push for a ceasefire in the region, while major Canadian Jewish groups have demanded Trudeau retract an earlier comment as lending credence to the claim by Hamas that Israel was responsible for an attack on a hospital in Gaza city.Justin Trudeau has been facing growing pressure to clear his stand against those responsible for the October 17 deadly Gaza hospital blast, which Palestinian officials blamed on Israeli airstrikes. 
However, Israel refuted the Palestinian claims and said the blast occurred due to a "rocket misfired by the Hamas" -- an account which was backed by US President Joe Biden.At least 4,137 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel began bombarding the Palestinian enclave, the Hamas-controlled health ministry said on Friday. The ministry said another 13,162 people have been wounded in the Israeli strikes, which have been ongoing since October 7.Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden is seeking $100 billion in new spending from Congress, with 60 billion dollars allocated for Ukraine,14 billion dollars for Israel, 10 billion dollars for humanitarian aid, 14 billion dollars for border security, and 7 billion dollars for the Indo-Pacific region.

NEW DELHI: Stopping well short of using the 'terror' word, Congress on Sunday condemned the "brutal attacks" on Israel, while asserting that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people should be resolved through dialogue. The party said violence could not be the solution to any problem.The opposition party's comment was in sharp contrast to the government's stand on Saturday, where PM Narendra Modi called the Hamas offensive "terrorist attacks in Israel".Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh said, "Congress condemns the brutal attacks on the people of Israel. 
Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations, while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people. Violence of any type never provides a solution and must stop."In June 2021, when a global controversy erupted over the Israeli forces' storming of the Al Aqsa compound, Congress had issued a statement expressing concern over "press reports indicating a perceptible shift in the Indian position between the Indian intervention in the UN Security Council on May 16 and our statement in the UN General Assembly on May 20". The party had said the initial statement was appropriate in noting that "intrusion by Israeli forces into the holy Al Aqsa mosque during Ramzan prayers ruptured the delicate peace in the region", but its omission in the UNGA was "incomprehensible".

NEW DELHI: A man interrupted climate activist Greta Thunberg onstage while she was addressing a crowd in Amsterdam, saying he attended the rally for a "climate demonstration and not for a political view", reported Metro.According to the news outlet, the attendees at the rally had been chanting "Palestine will be free" only moments before the man marched on the stage and grabbed her microphone."As a climate justice movement, we have to listen to the voices of those who are being oppressed and those who are fighting for freedom and for justice. Otherwise, there can be no climate justice without international solidarity," Greta was quoted as saying by Metro.‘"have come here for a climate demonstration, not a political view," the man said, to which one of the attendees said "Climate is politics".Later in the rally a Palestinian woman and an Afghan woman took the centre stage to speak on climate justice in "occupied lands".Afghan speaker Sahar Shirzad said Greta allowed her and the Palestinian woman to speak after the interruption.The gathering occurred shortly after a record-breaking climate protest in the Netherlands, with 70,000 people marching through Amsterdam to demand action against climate change.Greta has faced criticism in recent weeks for her online expression of pro-Palestinian views and was challenged by a spokesperson from the Israeli army."The world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected," Thungberg activist previously said."We are of course against any type of discrimination, and condemn antisemitism in all forms and shapes. 
This is non-negotiable," she added.In mid-October, the climate activist was detained during a London protest outside a central London hotel hosting a meeting of oil executives. Protesters sought to impede access to the InterContinental Hotel on Park Lane by occupying the pavement near the entrance.Greta was released on bail after being charged with violating conditions of a public order act and is scheduled to appear in Westminster Magistrates Court on November 15.

There are no winners in war: KCBC

Kochi: Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) said in a statement that viewing the Israel-Palestine crisis through the lens of communalism and spreading such information would only create more harm.
KCBC said that subsequent to the Israel-Palestine conflict, communal narrow-minded thinking and hate campaigns, causing division even in Kerala society, was not a good trend. It said that the need was to approach this crisis through a broader vision of humanity and to engage in constructive interventions with fraternity.
KCBC said in the statement that in the wake of the violent attack by Hamas terrorists against Israel, Pope Francis' approach of sharing the pain of the Israeli government and the people of Israel and holding close the common people who are killed, injured, and who lost everything in the war, was a model for governments.
"War does not bring victories to anyone, nor does it lead to the inevitable resolution of problems. All countries should understand this reality," KCBC said.
KCBC said that although it was a war between two relatively small communities, against the backdrop of it directly or indirectly affecting all the countries of the world, and considering the possibility that it may cause more casualties and other damages to the common people, there should be discussions to end the attacks and solve the problem. 
Community and political leaders should become willing to move forward by leaving behind the centuries-old racism, xenophobia and sectarianism and learning from past experiences. They should encourage their own communities to do the same as well, KCBC said. 
The Kerala Catholic Church expresses its solidarity with the oppressed community as well as condemn terrorist activities and the practices of giving support to them, which is disturbing global peace, the statement said. It added that it was India's responsibility of the India government to ensure the safety of Indians and to facilitate their return, if necessary. 
Meanwhile, Archbishop of Verapoly Joseph Kalathiparambil said that the acts of war going on in Israel and Palestine were deeply saddening to the human conscience.

NEW DELHI: A Palestine TV correspondent and 11 members of his family were killed Thursday in southern Gaza during what they believe was an Israeli airstrike, CNN reported. According to CNN, the reporter, Mohammad Abu Hattab, was doing a live report outside Nasser hospital in Gaza, and just 30 minutes later, he and his family were killed when he returned home. The loss of Hattab deeply affected his colleagues in the newsroom, and another Palestine TV journalist, Salman Al Bashir, emotionally reported the tragic news on-air.“We can’t bear this anymore. 
We are exhausted, we are here victims and martyrs awaiting our deaths, we are dying one after the other and no one cares about us or the large scale catastrophe and the crime in Gaza,” he said.“No protection, no international protection at all, no immunity to anything, this protection gear does not protect us and not those helmets,” Al Bashir continued, as he removed his own helmet and protective vest, which had “PRESS” inscribed in bright letters.“These are just slogans that we are wearing, it doesn’t protect any journalist at all,” he said.Al Bashir also said Israel’s weeks-long bombardment of the enclave had become unbearable for Palestinians in Gaza. “Live on air, we lose souls one after the other, without any price, we pass as martyrs, we await our turn one after the other,” he said.“Our colleague Mohammad Abu Hattab was standing here only 30 minutes ago, and now he left us, along with his wife, his brother, and many members of his family are now victims here inside the hospital.”Last week, Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief returned to air less than 24 hours after his family was killed in what the television network said was an Israeli airstrike on Wednesday.

Columbia university Alumni urge ban on calls for 'Global Intifada'

Over 500 Columbia University almuni have signed a letter expressing gratitude to the school for suspending two student groups, New York Post reported.  Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, were suspended for violating the university's rules on 'threatening rhetoric and intimidation'. The Students for Justice in Palestine was specifically accused of celebrating a terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7, resulting in over 1,200 people being killed in Israel and almost 240 others being taken hostage.“While debate, advocacy, and protest have always been, and must remain, central to Columbia’s DNA, the recent anti-Israel and pro-Hamas demonstrations display an unacceptable ignorance of historical facts and dangerous ideological militancy,” read the letter sent to the school Monday.“It is truly frightening to watch organizations of students at Columbia University act in ideological lockstep with authoritarian nations, regimes, or their proxies which advocate for violence, deny their citizens human rights and the free expression of ideas, and oppose equal rights for women and the LGBTQ community,” the alumni added.The Columbia University alumni, in expressing their appreciation for the suspension of the groups, have urged the university to prevent similar demonstrations in the future. They highlighted a significant increase in antisemitic incidents in New York City and worldwide following Israel's declaration of war in Gaza, the New York Post report said.According to the NYPD, there were at least 69 anti-Jewish incidents in October, more than three times the previous year's figure.The alumni's letter also raised concerns about statements made by the Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) after its suspension. 
The JVP indicated that it would not retreat from organizing pro-Palestinian rallies on campus, prompting the alumni to issue a warning regarding such comments.“Our actions will be louder than our words. For all those people who are yearning for freedom, and for the media outlets: Keep an on [sic] eye on Columbia,” the JVP said in a statement Saturday.The alumni said that the recent statement by the group served as a "direct threat" to escalate divisions on campus. They urged Columbia University to permanently ban both SJP and JVP. The letter also called on Columbia University president Minouche Shafik to directly condemn the phrase “From the river to the sea,” a chant used by pro-Palestinian protesters that the alumni said “implies the eradication of Jews from Israel.” For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

KOZHIKODE: IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty said that his party will conduct a Palestine solidarity rally in Kozhikode on October 26 and it will be the biggest pro-Palestine rally in India with lakhs of participants. The event will be inaugurated by party state president Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor will attend the event, said party leaders."This is the land of Gandhi; we have always stood with the oppressed. Strong protest marches are happening across the world, including Israel, to awaken human conscience. 
At this juncture we have decided to conduct a rally that will catch the international community's attention," said Kunhalikutty.He added that the event planned at Kozhikode Beach isn't a regular protest. "If you see international channels and newspapers, you will understand that the situation in Gaza and nearby regions are witnessing a serious situation. Hospitals filled with those injured in the bombings are told to evacuate. They cannot move away," he said.Thousands of people took part in a protest rally at London, Washington DC, New York, Korea. In India rallies were hosted in various cities, he said, adding that the rally will be held peacefully using pre-approved slogans. "We informed the international media. Some may ask what's the use of this protest; if human conscience is awakened, then there is some use," he said.Kunhalikutty said the attacks in Israel were a continuation of the ongoing oppression in the region and if atrocities committed by Israel were prevented, then none of this would have happened, he claimed. "They are killing children, the elderly, patients... Is the conscience of the international community numb? That is the question Israel is creating. Even now, western countries are competing to support Israel. Now, there is no question about whether it is a problem in our country or not. It is everyone's problem," he said.He said that India had always supported Palestine people. "Initially, India supported Israel and then softened its stand a bit. The serious issue is that there is no need to amend the traditional stand," he said.He said almost all parties in INDIA bloc support the people of Palestine.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

India condemns terrorism, stands with Israel: PM Modi to Bibi

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday again expressed solidarity with Israel saying the people of India stood firmly with the Jewish state, as his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu called to brief him about the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas war. Modi reiterated India's condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.In the phone conversation, Modi also highlighted the issue of safety and security of Indian citizens in Israel and Netanyahu assured him of full support and cooperation in that regard, according to the Indian government. There are 18,000 Indian nationals in Israel, including 900 students. 
"I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his phone call and providing an update on the ongoing situation. People of India stand firmly with Israel in this difficult hour. India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations," Modi wrote on X, shortly after the conversation.On Saturday, after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, Modi had described the offensive as terrorist attacks while expressing condolences to the innocent victims and their families. In his talks with the Israeli PM on Tuesday, Modi again expressed deep condolences and sympathy for those killed and wounded as a result of the terrorist attacks in Israel. The leaders agreed to remain in close touch. India's response to the conflict in West Asia so far has been limited to Modi's tweets and a readout of his conversation with the Israeli PM. Aware of the sensitivities involved at home, the government has been careful to not publicly offer any support to Israel but, unlike China, it has also not sought an immediate ceasefire.Modi is known to share a close rapport with the Israeli PM and was hoping to host him later this year. Netanyahu was also the PM when Modi, in 2017, travelled to Israel for the first ever visit by an Indian PM to the country. Amid efforts by the Modi government for "de-hyphenation" of India's ties with Israel and Palestine, the India-Israel relationship was also upgraded to a strategic partnership during that visit.Modi, however, also became the first Indian PM the very next year to visit Palestine and his government continues to maintain that India's backing of the Palestinian cause is an "integral" part of its foreign policy. India officially continues to support a negotiated solution resulting in a "sovereign, independent, viable and united" Palestine state, at peace with Israel.Looking to mobilise support for the Israel counter-offensive, which has seen its forces pound the Gaza strip with air strikes, Netanyahu has spoken to many world leaders in the past few days. These include the leaders of France, Germany, UK, Italy and Ukraine, apart from US President Joe Biden. As Israel has said, all of them expressed "unreserved" support for Israel's right to defend itself.Netanyahu's assurance about the safety and security of Indians is significant as a large number of Indians continue to live in Israel. According to the external affairs ministry, there are about 18,000 Indian citizens in Israel, primarily caregivers employed by Israeli elders, diamond traders, IT professionals and students. Tourism between the two countries has also received a boost with Air India since 2018 operating five flights every week between Delhi and Tel Aviv. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Hundreds of people gathered in Dearborn, a city in Michigan, for a rally supporting the Palestinians after Hamas launched an attack on Israel. The protest took place at the Ford Community and Performing Arts Center.Amer Zahr, president of the New Generation for Palestine, leading the cheer chanted, "Free free Palestine," according to Fox2 Detroit. Zahr said that they were not ashamed to stand for Palestinians as whatever happened in Israel was not an unprovoked attack but a response to 75 years of oppression and occupation."This is not complicated, this is simply racism, apartheid, occupation, and ethnic cleansing," he said and added that they were here to protest, and to stand against it which is going on since 1948."While violence continues in Gaza, Palestine, and Israel, he said, "We are a room full of love, full of hope, full of faith," Zahr said. 
"We have a homeland, we love our people. We love justice."Meanwhile, the West is standing against the attack. Earlier today, European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said that the Palestinian militant group Hamas's attack was a cold-blooded 'act of war' and fully backed Israel's right to defend itself.Addressing the meeting of European commissioners, von der Leyen supported a full review of the EU's multi-million-euro financial support for Palestinian projects. Meanwhile Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the West to rally around the people of Israel as they did around Ukraine after Russia's invasion and show them they are not 'alone'. "My recommendation to the leaders is to go to Israel and I think to support people, just people I'm not speaking about any institutions, just to support people who have been under terrorist attacks," he said on a visit to NATO headquarters.On Monday, the US also came forward to help Israel. US President Joe Biden said that he has directed his team to work with Israeli counterparts, according to the Department of Defence. "While we are still working to confirm, we believe it is likely that American citizens may be among those being held by Hamas," Biden said. "I have directed my team to work with their Israeli counterparts on every aspect of the hostage crisis, including sharing intelligence and deploying experts from across the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage recovery efforts."The senior defense official said the unprecedented Hamas attack is notable for its violence. "I want to differentiate this from other times we have seen conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza," the official said. "This is ISIS-level savagery that we have seen committed against Israeli civilians - houses burned to the ground, young people massacred at music festivals."Hamas launched a barbaric 'surprise attack' on Israel on October 7.

BAREILLY: A UP police constable has been suspended over his social media post supporting Palestine on Facebook, officials said on Monday. Constable Suhail Ansari, posted in Reserve police lines in Kheri, had put a status seeking financial aid for Palestine on his FB account. 
In the purported post, Ansari said: "Help save Palestine, 1 repost =$1".A complaint was sent in this matter to the director general of police by one social media user, Anupam Tiwari, stating that, "After a terrorist attack on October 7, when India is standing with Israel, a UP constable is collecting funds for Palestine."After Tiwari's post went viral, SSP (Kheri) Ganesh Prasad Saha tasked additional SP Naipal Singh to conduct a probe. Initial investigation confirmed that the post was shared from Ansari's FB account. The SSP then ordered his suspension. Circle officer (Sadar) Sandeep Kumar said, "Ansari's post asking for donations for Palestinians was widely circulated online. Several complaints were received against him that's why the SSP suspended him."Meanwhile, in his defence, Ansari said that the post was not shared by him, but his minor son instead. "A post related to Palestine was shared from my phone by my son while playing a game. I would like to apologise if someone's sentiments were hurt because of it," he said.

Adult magazine Playboy has broken ties with former pornstar Mia Khalifa, citing her recent social media posts expressing support for Palestine and Hamas during the Israel-Hamas conflict. The termination came as a response to what Playboy labeled as "disgusting and reprehensible" comments, particularly Khalifa's celebration of Hamas's attacks on Israel.In an official statement, the magazine emphasized on its commitment to free expression and constructive political debate but asserted a zero-tolerance policy towards hate speech. 
Mia Khalifa's controversial social media postsThe controversy began with Khalifa's social media post expressing solidarity with Hamas militants, urging support for Palestinians. She faced backlash for invoking the apartheid analogy and subsequently escalated tensions by encouraging freedom fighters in Palestine to document events in high-quality footage, intending to preserve a historical record.Khalifa had earlier challenged Kylie Jenner's stance on the issue, who had posted and later deleted a message expressing support for Israel. She questioned Jenner's geopolitical understanding, emphasizing the responsibility of influencers to engage thoughtfully in global issues.Fallout extends beyond PlayboyThe repercussions of Khalifa's posts also affected a business deal with Canadian radio personality Todd Shapiro. In the process of finalizing an agreement, Shapiro announced Khalifa's immediate termination citing her tweet as "horrendous" and urging her to evolve into a better human being.The controversy unfolded amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, with the death toll surpassing 1,600 on both sides.

NEW DELHI: Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett dismissed the arguments put forth by MSNBC host Katy Tur and the international community during their discussion on the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In light of Israel's response to the October 7th Hamas attack, which involved both military strikes and a ground invasion of Gaza, numerous members of the global community have voiced their concerns. They claim that these actions are excessive and may even amount to genocide. These critiques have elicited strong reactions from many Israelis.Tur expressed her sorrow over the suffering of children and the overall violence resulting from the October 7th attack, and she posed the following question:"But I’m sure that there are Palestinians that can show images of their own kids that they’re worried about that have died in this, and much of the world is calling for a ceasefire. 
A lot of allies are saying at the very least, a pause, if not voting for a ceasefire in the UN, why do you think that so much of the world is asking Israel to stop for a moment?"Bennett said he did not have an answer, but suggested that Israel is being "held to a different standard.""Imagine if America, instead of Mexico, had a state of Al-Qaeda, with 240 American hostages, including babies, there, and this Al-Qaeda state entered Florida and raped women and murdered parents in front of their children, and vice versa and burnt them, would anyone ask America to cease fire against this Al-Qaeda state?" He asked.In 2005, Israel disengaged from the Gaza Strip, but shortly after, Hamas gained control in the area through elections and has not held elections since. Naftali Bennett, who served as prime minister from 2021 to 2022, suggested that many Israelis believed that if Palestinian "just have good enough lives, they’ll get off our case," but instead "they created a nightmare." He then said that Israel cannot tolerate any Hamas presence near its border.Tur pointed out that many believe a two-state solution would be the most effective long-term resolution to the conflict, allowing Gazans to enjoy all the benefits of a sovereign nation on their land.Bennett opposed this suggestion, arguing that it has been attempted in the past and proven unsuccessful."We tried precisely that. I want to be very clear to the viewers now. Until 2005, Israel occupied Gaza. In 2005, we pulled out of Gaza, back to the 1967 borders. We handed the entire territory over to the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. There was no blockade, nothing. They had the chance to form the Palestinian state that everyone’s talking about. No one stopped them. They have beautiful beaches and beautiful weather, and they dedicated those 17 years to shooting rockets at us, and to killing us, so would you try it again?" he asked.Tur appeared to blame Israel for the government in Gaza, implying it was only because they weren't a true state that Hamas "became radicalized.""Gazans haven’t had a vote in 17 years because Hamas took over and hasn’t held an election, and although you gave the territory back to Gazans, and yes, they voted for Hamas, and then Hamas became radicalized, they weren’t a state," she argued. "It wasn’t like you handed over statehood," also arguing that it wasn’t enough because Gaza wasn't connected to the West Bank."But that’s beside the point. We’re talking about Gaza. The West Bank is the West Bank, and Gaza is Gaza. They got everything they wanted," Bennett said. "Would you try that again? Would you experiment again after what they did? I can tell you that Israelis left and right, there’s consensus, no one wants to try experiments, dangerous experiments, again."(via Fox News) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI:  Shri Thanedar, an Indian-American Congressman, on Monday called Hamas the "barbaric terrorists" who should be eliminated with all its military capabilities dismantled.Speaking at an event in the US Capitol in support of Israel, Thanedar also highlighted the sufferings being born by the civilians in Gaza due to Israeli air strikes and called for their "freedom from the terrorist outfit"."Hamas is not a militant organization. Hamas is not a resistance movement, they are just barbaric terrorists. This is a time when we just can't just push them because they will regroup and come back and do these atrocities once again. 
Yes, that's what they will do. So you know, we need at this stage to eliminate them. Eliminate the space of this, you know, we need to dismantle their military operations," Thanedar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. "We need to free the Palestinian people, the two million Palestinian people that live in Gaza. They need to be freed from these terrorist controls of Gaza. So that addition is what I feel. Now there is a lot of talk about ceasefire, but I feel that it's premature, these Hamas terrorists have used the civilians," he added.Israel has claimed to have lost more than 1400 people in the sudden October 7 attack by Hamas that later took more than 200 people hostage in Gaza.Congressional briefing in support of Israel was organised by Multi-faith Alliance HinduACTion and Namaste Shalom. The gathering was also aimed to address the rising anti-Hindu bigotry and antisemitism in the US and Canada."Misused the civilians as a shield for them and unfortunately that's causing tremendous loss which is so regrettable. Tremendous loss of lives of innocent people. But these innocent people they need to have their future, they need to have their life, they need to have their human rights and they need to be freed from the oppression of Hamas and basically exploitation Hamas is doing of these innocent civilians in Gaza," said Thanedar.Shri Thanedar also highlighted the loss of civilian lives on both sides, Israel and Gaza and condemned the attacks on Israel.Condemning the attacks on Israel and pointing out the loss of lives on both sides (Gaza and Israel), Thandear said "Loss of civilian life, Whether it is Israeli civilian life or Palestinian civilian life should not happen, that's something that's never desirable and never got to come."Hamas officials in the Palestinian enclave claimed on Monday that Israeli strikes have killed at least 5,087 people in Gaza since the war erupted on October 7. On the other hand, the Israeli administration asserted that the Hamas attack has claimed over 1400 lives, adding that the terrorist outfit has taken more than 200 hostages.

NEW DELHI: Israeli actress Gal Gadot, known for her portrayal of Wonder Woman, is heading an initiative to screen a 47-minute video provided by the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) spokesperson. The video documents the events of October 7 when Hamas targeted Israeli communities along the Gaza border.i24 News reported that the screening is scheduled to take place in front of a curated audience, including Hollywood celebrities and prominent figures.As per a report by The Wrap, the video is scheduled for screening this week in Los Angeles and New York, titled "Bearing Witness to the October 7th Massacre." The planning of these screenings is being supported by the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee.The initiative is led by Israeli-American Oscar-winning director Guy Nattiv, known for his notable work "Golda." 
Expressing his determination to ensure that the images from October 7 are not forgotten by the world, Nattiv said, We cannot pass by in silence. People who have film experience, so we can show them this crazy document that is reminiscent of the films created about the Holocaust"The plan is to hold an initial screening for 120 spectators, with the possibility of further screenings based on the level of interest generated. Some who have already viewed the video, including foreign journalists and members of the Israeli Knesset were reportedly so disturbed by its content that they left the screening mid-view.Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, arranged a separate screening of the video for a select audience, including high-ranking ambassadors and diplomats. The goal is to raise international awareness about the actions of Hamas which is regarded as a terrorist organization.Gal Gadot has been vocal about the situation in the region on her social media account, expressing concern for those affected by the conflict and the ongoing violence.Her first post on the Israel-Hamas conflict read, “At least 250 Israeli have been murdered and dozens of women children and elders held as hostages in Gaza, by Palestinian military group Hamas. Starting early morning more than 3,000 rockets were fire. Hamas is holding hostages, controlling bases and settlements in Israel. There have been more than 1,500 injured and heavy fighting is still ongoing. “I hear their voices and they are banging on the door. I am with my two little children. My heart is aching Praying for all of those in pain.”The actress has faced heavy criticism for her involvement in organizing the screening and her stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict with many accusing her of supporting alleged genocide of Palestinians.

Know why freed Hamas hostages are returning to Israel via Egypt

NEW DELHI: Hamas hostages being released after a tense truce brokered by Egypt, Qatar, and the US are first crossing into Egypt through the Rafah border before eventually returning to Israel.Under prisoners-hostages swap terms, the Gaza-based terrorist group has freed 24 captives in the first phase and 17 in the second, while Israel has reportedly released 78 Palestinian prisoners.Out of the total released hostages, 26 include Israelis, including foreign nations -- the majority of whom are Thai nations.Hostages freed by Hamas are being handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Israeli officials are assisting in the process by taking the captives to the Rafah border. From there, they are helped to return home through Egypt, using a special entrance at the Kerem Shalom crossing.On Saturday, 17 individuals were transported to Israel through Rafah. 
The majority of these Israeli hostages were suspected to have been taken from Kibbutz Be’eri.Notably, foreign nationals who need to fly to their respective countries do not have to take the Rafah route.Amid the ongoing truce between Israel and Hamas, hostages could have been directly transferred from Gaza into Israel.However, reports from local media suggest that the route through Egypt was chosen likely to give Cairo additional credit for its efforts in securing the release of the hostages.Egypt has played a crucial role in mediating the hostage deal."Egypt's mediation efforts have yielded the release of 12 Thai hostages and 13 Israelis, including women and children, held by Hamas," Egypt's State Information Service (SIS) said in a statement on Friday.Four-day ceasefireThe first group of hostages were released by Hamas from Gaza on Friday as a four-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began.Apart from the prisoners-hostage swap, the cease-fire will ensure the uninterrupted flow of much-needed aid into the enclave.For Gaza's two million-plus residents, the deal spells a respite from weeks of sustained Israeli bombardment. The territory's Hamas government says the war has so far killed about 15,000 people and displaced countless more.Over the four days, at least 50 hostages are expected to be released, leaving an estimated 190 in the hands of Palestinian militant groups. Meanwhile, 150 Palestinian prisoners are expected to be released. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

No G20 consensus on Israel-Palestine resolution: Jaishankar

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar said that an overwhelming number of G20 countries, but not all, spoke explicitly about the two-state solution regarding Israel and Palestine and that there was no consensus on it during Wednesday’s virtual summit.The Israel-Hamas issue, not surprisingly, dominated the proceedings at the interaction, almost pushing Russia’s war on Ukraine to the background. The Russia-Ukraine conflict did figure, but not as the main concern, and was, in fact, used by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was absent from the G20 Summit in Delhi in September, to push back at the West’s criticism of his aggression against Kyiv.When European leaders called the Russian aggression in Ukraine “shocking”, Putin responded by saying military actions were always a tragedy for “specific people, specific families, and the country as a whole’’. Significantly, Putin also said “we must think about how to stop this tragedy”.Referring to the Israel-Hamas conflict, he said, “Isn’t the extermination of the civilian population in Palestine, in the Gaza Strip, shocking today? Isn’t it shocking that the secretary general of the UN said that Gaza has turned into a huge children’scemetery?
”In his opening remarks, PM Modi told the G20 leaders that new challenges had appeared in the past few months and lack of security and instability in the West Asia region was a cause of concern for all.“Our coming together symbolises that we are all sensitive to issues and standing together to resolve them. We believe that terrorism is unacceptable to all of us. The death of civilians, no matter where it takes place, is condemnable,’’ hesaid.“Despite the clouds of crisis looming, One Family (a theme of India’s presidency) has the power to together work for peace. From the human welfare perspective, we can raise our voice against terrorism and violence and in favour of humanity. India is ready to work hand-in-hand with others to fulfil these expectations of the world and humanity,’’ he added.Israel had earlier in the day announced that 50 hostages will be released over four days, during which fighting will remain paused. It also said the release of every 10 additional hostages would result in one additional day of truce. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Americans are split over Israel's action against Hamas, Biden's approval dips further: Poll

NEW DELHI: Americans are divided on whether Israel's response to Hamas' October 7 attack has been excessive or appropriate, with a majority of Democrats now expressing the view that it has been too much, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.The outcomes were driven by individuals of colour and younger respondents, who were significantly more inclined to assert that Israel's actions have exceeded appropriate limits. Moreover, they expressed a greater degree of sympathy towards the Palestinians as opposed to the Israelis.Distinct divisions exist on the question of whether to allocate funds for both the Israel and Ukraine conflicts, neither, or only one. Additionally, opinions differ on whether the US should assume a leadership role globally.Once again, younger Americans and individuals of nonwhite ethnicities, along with majorities of independents and Republicans, advocate for a greater focus on addressing domestic issues rather than taking on a leadership role on the world stage.The poll highlights a split among Americans regarding Israel's military actions, with 38 per cent stating that the Israeli response has been excessive, while an equal number believe it has been "about right." 
The percentage of individuals who feel the response has gone too far has increased by 12 points compared to a month ago.56% of Democrats, according to polls, now think that Israel's response has been excessive, marking a significant 21-point increase from last month.On the other hand, a majority of Republicans (52%) believe the response has been appropriate, reflecting an 8-point increase from the previous month. This shift is largely attributed to many Republicans transitioning from initially considering the response as "too little" in the aftermath of the Hamas attack to now deeming it "about right."Nonwhites were 15 points more inclined to state that the response has been excessive (48% compared to 33% for whites). Additionally, individuals under 45 were 17 points more likely than those over 45 to express the opinion that the response had been excessive."Democratic men (59%), Biden voters (59%) and people who live in big cities (53%) were most likely to say the response has been too much," according to the poll.Respondents expressed a preference for Israelis over Palestinians by a margin of 61% to 30%. However, this sentiment is largely driven by Republicans (79%) and independents (67%) who overwhelmingly favour Israel.In contrast, Democrats are divided, with 45% expressing sympathy for Israelis and an equal 45% for Palestinians.Regarding the Israel-Hamas war, 55% of respondents disapprove of Biden's handling, which is 3 points worse than last month. Among Democrats, Biden has a 60% approval for his handling of the war, down 17 points from last month.However, his approval is at a low 33% among independents and 39% among those under 45.

Israel seeks to hire 1 lakh Indian migrants to replace Palestinian workers

NEW DELHI: The Israeli construction industry has requested permission from Tel Aviv's authorities to hire up to 1 lakh Indian labourers as replacements for the Palestinian workers, according to a report by Voice of America (VOA) from the West Bank, as reported by The Independent. This comes amid the backdrop of Israeli construction sector facing a labour shortage due to the cancellation of work permits for Palestinian workers after the horrific Hamas attacks on October 7.Haim Feiglin, the vice president of the Israel Builders Association, was quoted by VOA as saying “Right now we are negotiating with India,” despite India's historical support for a two-state solution to the conflict.“We are waiting for [the] decision of the Israeli government to approve that. And, we hope to engage 50,000 to 100,000 workers from India to be able to run the whole sector and bring it back to normal.“We are at war and the Palestinian workers, which are about 25 per cent of our human resources in the sector, are not coming, are not permitted to work in Israel.”In May of this year, the Indian government signed a bilateral agreement with Israel to enable the immigration of 42,000 Indian workers. 
As per a statement from the Israeli foreign ministry, 34,000 of these workers were intended for employment in the construction sector, and the remaining 8,000 were designated for nursing roles.Following the October 7 attacks, it is uncertain whether the Indian government still supports the relocation of thousands of its citizens to Israel. Last month, India initiated "Operation Ajay" to facilitate the return of stranded Indian citizens from Israel to India.Five flights have brought back Indian citizens from Israel so far. “Special charter flights and other arrangements (are) being put in place,” Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar wrote in a post on X/Twitter. “[We are] fully committed to the safety and well-being of our nationals abroad.”On October 26, India stood out as the sole member of the South Asian group of nations that chose to abstain from a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution seeking a "humanitarian truce" in Gaza. The resolution gained support from 120 member countries, while 14 countries opposed it, and India was one of the 45 nations that opted to abstain from voting. During a phone call between Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Raisi called on New Delhi to use “all its capacities to end the Zionist crimes against the oppressed people of Gaza”.“The continuation of the killing of the Palestinian people has infuriated all of the free nations of the world and this killing will have extra-regional consequences,” Ebrahim Raisi’s spokesperson said.In response to the Hamas attacks on October 7, during which 1,400 Israelis lost their lives, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu initiated extensive airstrikes on Gaza and launched a ground invasion, marking an unprecedented military action.Despite repeated calls for a ceasefire from global leaders, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has thus far declined to agree to one. On Monday, the Israeli prime minister mentioned the possibility of considering  “tactical little pauses”  in the Gaza operation to allow for humanitarian aid access to Gaza or the safe release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

Jews, Palestinians, and Muslims in US alarmed by escalating hatred and bigotry

NEW DELHI: Communities in the United States are feeling a strong sense of fear and tension due to recent violent incidents linked to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Some are drawing parallels between the current situation and the atmosphere experienced in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, reported CNN."Every one of us feels unsafe," said Zein Rimawi, founder and member of the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge in south Brooklyn, New York, where three young men were attacked by a small pro-Israel cadre only days after the war started. "It's worse than after 9/11."The neighborhood activist, speaking to CNN, mentioned that he was living in Bay Ridge during the 2001 terrorist attacks. He recalled feeling scared at that time but also noted that he felt protected by political leaders because they defended American Muslims from discrimination.Regarding the reference to the Israel-Hamas conflict, it's important to clarify that there may be discrepancies in the number of casualties and events reported by different sources. The situation is complex, and numbers and details can vary.The events in the Middle East have had a ripple effect on major cities like New York. 
Advocates and community leaders are reporting a surge in hate-inspired incidents, with Jews, Palestinians, Muslims, and other groups being targeted in the aftermath of the initial attacks. Shockingly, in some cases, individuals have been singled out simply because they appeared to belong to one of these groups.It's crucial to note that New York City is home to one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel and also boasts one of the country's most substantial Muslim populations. After the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, FBI data showed that anti-Muslim motivated crimes became the second highest reported among religious-bias incidents, with anti-Jewish religion incidents being the highest.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) documented over 1,200 antisemitic incidents in the United States up to May 2023, following a previous record high in 2022. Since the recent conflict involving Hamas' attack in Israel, there has been an increase in antisemitic images and rhetoric. Nationally, the ADL has reported a 54% rise in antisemitic incidents compared to the same period last year, with 168 incidents occurring between October 7 and October 19.However, it's essential to understand that the reported numbers only provide a partial picture of the situation. An incident occurred on October 11 in Brooklyn's Bay Ridge neighborhood, known for its sizable Palestinian community. In this incident, a group of men, some of whom were carrying an Israeli flag, confronted three men on the street. They asked if these individuals were Palestinian and shouted offensive remarks such as "F**k Palestine, F**k Islam," as detailed in a criminal complaint.Regrettably, one of the victims needed medical attention following the attack, as mentioned in the complaint. Two of the attackers have been charged with assault and menacing as a hate crime, while four others remain at large, according to the complaint.On that very same day, a 19-year-old individual assaulted a 24-year-old student from Columbia University. The student was in the process of putting up posters containing information about Israeli casualties, as reported in the criminal complaint and local news. The 19-year-old forcefully removed the posters and used offensive language toward the student before physically striking them with a broomstick. Consequently, the 19-year-old faced charges of assault as a hate crime, along with other related charges, as outlined in the complaint.Then, on October 14, a 29-year-old woman experienced a troubling incident in the Grand Central subway station in Midtown Manhattan. The woman was punched in the face, and when she inquired why she was attacked, her assailant responded with "because you're Jewish," as per police reports. Subsequently, a 28-year-old man was arrested later in the week and faced charges of a hate crime and aggravated assault.A 6-year-old boy was tragically stabbed to death, and his mother suffered severe injuries in Plainfield Township, Illinois, near Chicago. The suspect, a 71-year-old who was their landlord, is believed to have targeted them due to their Muslim identity, in light of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East involving Hamas and the Israelis. The suspect has been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other charges.But while the numbers of reported incidents tick up, advocates say there are scores of others that never reach law enforcement."Who are you going to tell when somebody comes up to you and screams, 'Free Palestine,' at you?" said Richman, of the ADL. "Or there's a swastika that's been painted at your school? All kinds of incidents have been reported to us."Richman expressed that his office is facing significant challenges in managing the substantial increase in cases. He also anticipates that the number of incidents, both at the local and national levels, could rise further if Israeli ground troops become involved in Gaza."We know from experience that when there is a flare up in the Israel-Palestine, Israel-Hamas conflict, we see Jews are targeted in this country, in other countries, essentially being blamed for the actions of the Israeli government or the Israeli military," Richman said. "Nobody knows where anybody stands but people make assumptions because they are Jewish and then want to take out their anger on the Jewish community."According to CNN report, Ahmed Rehab, who serves as the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations' Chicago office, mentioned that his office usually receives four to six complaints a week from people who report being victims of mistreatment or bullying. However, since the beginning of the conflict just over two weeks ago, they've received a striking 86 complaints."My phone has been ringing off the hook," said Rehab, who added he believes the current situation is much worse now than it was after 9/11. Not only are people scared, Rehab says, but now, no one seems to want to hear from Muslim Americans."Palestinians are essentially dehumanized and there has been a conclusion that they deserve what's coming to them because of what's happened in Israel," said Rehab. "There isn't much appetite for the nuance that's needed to have the discussion of the value of human life and of a civilian life."Rehab, who was employed at a major accounting firm in Chicago during the 9/11 events, vividly recalls how his family and friends suffered from hate crimes in the aftermath of those attacks. He emphasized that individuals who are victims of bias incidents frequently choose not to report these crimes due to a mix of factors, including feeling that doing so may not lead to any meaningful change."There's a lot of 'toughen up,' especially in our culture," Rehab said. "There's also a sense of, 'I don't want to appear weak' or a sense of hopelessness that nothing will be done or can be done about it. Or there's a sense of bureaucracy. 'We've done this before,' and it just fizzles into bureaucracy."(via CNN report) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Cornell Professor Russell Rickford, who sparked controversy with his remarks regarding the Hamas terror attack on Israel, is now on a leave of absence until the end of the semester.According to a report in the New York Post, Russell Rickford, an associate professor of history, faced widespread criticism after making statements during a pro-Palestinian protest following the October 7 surprise attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,400 people, primarily civilians.He described the attack as "exhilarating" and "energizing," leading to significant backlash, New York Post reported."It was exhilarating. It was exhilarating, it was energizing," he was seen telling the crowd, claiming "you would not be human" not to feel the same.Earlier, Rickford defended his statements but later issued an apology, acknowledging that his words were "reprehensible." Consequently, his students were informed that he would no longer be teaching for the remainder of the semester. 
According to the New York Post, a petition calling for his termination on Change.org gained nearly 11,000 signatures, including support from notable figures such as US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and US Representative Claudia Tenney.In response to the controversy, Cornell University confirmed that Professor Russell Rickford had requested and received approval for a leave of absence. The university also reassigned his course to Professor Tamika Nunley, who will assume teaching responsibilities for the post-Civil War African American history course. Cornell's leadership, including President Martha Pollack and board of trustees chairman Kraig Kayser, denounced Rickford's remarks, describing them as "reprehensible" and confirming that the university is taking the incident seriously and reviewing it in accordance with its procedures, the New York Post reported.In his recent apology, Rickford expressed his opposition to racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, militarism, fundamentalism, and all systems that dehumanize, divide, and oppress people. Initially, he had refused to retract his statements, explaining that he was referring to the initial hours of the attack when it appeared to symbolize resistance in the Palestinian struggle."I apologize for the horrible choice of words that I used in a portion of a speech that was intended to stress grassroots African American, Jewish and Palestinian traditions of resistance to oppression," he added.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian on Thursday warned that if Israel's ongoing retaliation against Hamas doesn't end then the "United States will not be spared from this fire."Speaking at the meeting of the 193-member General Assembly on the Middle East United, he said, "I say frankly to the American statesmen, who are now managing the genocide in Palestine, that we do not welcome the expansion of the war in the region. But if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire."In response to an October 7 attack that resulted in numerous casualties and hostages, Israel has pledged to take strong measures against Hamas, the ruling authority in Gaza. These measures include airstrikes, an imposed siege, and preparations for a potential ground invasion. Palestinian authorities claim that the death toll exceeds 7,000.Hamas has communicated its readiness to release civilian hostages to Iran, emphasizing the importance of international efforts to secure the release of around 6,000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Iran, along with Qatar and Turkey, stands prepared to contribute to this critical humanitarian initiative. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: In a special session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Friday, India stressed the need for explicit condemnation of the terrorist attacks by Hamas on October 7.The UNGA adopted a resolution on the same day, calling for an "immediate, durable, and sustained humanitarian truce" between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in Gaza. The adopted resolution, initially moved by Jordan, didn't contain explicit condemnation of the October 7 terrorist attacks, but an amendment was introduced to include this condemnation before the main Resolution's vote.India abstained from voting for the non-binding Jordanian resolution but voted in favor of a Canada-led amendment to the draft resolution on the Gaza crisis, which unfortunately didn't achieve the required two-thirds majority for passage, ANI reported.India's vote on the Resolution was guided by India's steadfast and consistent position on the issue. "Our Explanation of Vote (EOV) reiterates this comprehensively and holistically," sources familiar with the matter told ANI.According to ANI, the EOV expressed deep concerns about the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, highlighting significant civilian casualties, especially among women and children. 
India welcomed the international community's efforts to de-escalate the situation and deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, emphasizing its own contributions.Further added, "We are deeply concerned at the deteriorating security situation and astounding loss of civilian lives in the ongoing conflict. The escalation of hostilities in the region will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. It is necessary for all parties to display the utmost responsibility."India's Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Yojna Patel, in her address explaining India's vote, reiterated the country's long-standing support for a negotiated two-state solution for the Israel-Palestine issue. India seeks the establishment of a sovereign, independent, and viable State of Palestine living within secure and recognized borders, alongside Israel in peace. She urged the parties to de-escalate, renounce violence, and work towards creating conditions for the early resumption of direct peace negotiations.Despite India's preference for the Canadian resolution that explicitly condemned the terrorist attacks by Hamas, the Jordanian-led draft resolution was adopted by the General Assembly. The vote resulted in 120 nations in favor, 14 against, and 45 abstentions. Countries like Iceland, India, Panama, Lithuania, and Greece were among those that abstained from voting on the resolution.This adoption of the Jordanian resolution marks the first formal response of the United Nations to the escalation of violence in Israel and Palestine since the Hamas terror attacks of October 7. This vote occurred as Israel announced an expansion of ground operations in Gaza, highlighting the urgency and complexity of the situation. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Over 100 Columbia University professors sign letter backing students who supported Hamas’ Oct 7 attack

NEW DELHI: Over 100 professors at Columbia University came together to sign a letter in support of students who expressed their views on the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, reported the New York Post. The students voiced their support for Hamas' "military action" in Israel on October 7. In the wake of these demonstrations, some of the university's prominent donors have threatened to withhold their financial contributions.The professors' letter, made public on Monday, stated the need for the university administration to protect the students involved in the demonstrations from potential negative consequences on the Manhattan campus. These consequences include doxxing efforts by individuals operating trucks that label the students as "Columbia's Leading Anti-Semites."Additionally, the professors called for a halt to the university's educational initiatives in Israel. They further requested that the administration refrain from issuing statements that appear to favour one side in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the other.The situation has brought to the forefront the challenges faced by educational institutions when dealing with complex and divisive geopolitical issues. 
“As scholars who are committed to robust inquiry about the most challenging matters of our time, we feel compelled to respond to those who label our students antisemitic if they express empathy for the lives and dignity of Palestinians and/or if they signed a student-written statement that situated the military action begun on Oct. 7 within the larger context of the occupation of Palestine by Israel,” the letter read as per The Post.“In our view, the student statement aims to recontextualize the events of Oct. 7, 2023, pointing out that military operations and state violence did not begin that day, but rather it represented a military response by a people who had endured crushing and unrelenting state violence from an occupying power over many years,” they wrote of the brutal terror attack that killed more than 1,400 Israelis, most of them civilians," it further read.According to the New York Post, the professors wrote in the letter "that the students believe that peace and safety will remain elusive unless the illegal occupation of Palestinian territory ends and accountability for that illegal occupation is achieved,” which they claim is “not a radical or essentially controversial opinion,” noting it is backed by the United Nations and several human rights organizations.Professors at Columbia University have expressed their support for the Palestine Solidarity Groups on campus, endorsing their characterization of conditions in Gaza as "apartheid." They also pointed out that organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also recognized and reported on these conditions.According to The Post, faculty members conclude their letter by saying, “One of the core responsibilities of a world-class university is to interrogate the underlying facts of both settled propositions and those that are ardently disputed.“As faculty, we are committed to the project of holding discomfort and working across difference[s] with our students. These core academic values and purposes are profoundly undermined when our students are vilified for voicing perspectives that, while legitimately debated in other institutional settings, expose them to severe forms of harassment and intimidation at Columbia," it read.Columbia University administrators have refrained from offering a direct response to the professors' letter. They did, however, highlight the existence of a separate statement from faculty members, currently in circulation, which encourages and supports the university's connections with Israel. This alternative statement has garnered signatures from over 200 staff members as of Monday afternoon. “In the wake of this sobering conflict, we write to express our commitment to the University’s ties with Israel. Our research and teaching missions benefit from these ties, and we encourage the University to build on them,” it read, as per The New York Post.A university spokesperson told The Post that “antisemitism or any other form of hate will never be tolerated in our community".

NEW DELHI: Stopping well short of using the 'terror' word, Congress on Sunday condemned the "brutal attacks" on Israel, while asserting that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people should be resolved through dialogue. The party said violence could not be the solution to any problem.The opposition party's comment was in sharp contrast to the government's stand on Saturday, where PM Narendra Modi called the Hamas offensive "terrorist attacks in Israel".Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh said, "Congress condemns the brutal attacks on the people of Israel. 
Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations, while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people. Violence of any type never provides a solution and must stop."In June 2021, when a global controversy erupted over the Israeli forces' storming of the Al Aqsa compound, Congress had issued a statement expressing concern over "press reports indicating a perceptible shift in the Indian position between the Indian intervention in the UN Security Council on May 16 and our statement in the UN General Assembly on May 20". The party had said the initial statement was appropriate in noting that "intrusion by Israeli forces into the holy Al Aqsa mosque during Ramzan prayers ruptured the delicate peace in the region", but its omission in the UNGA was "incomprehensible".

Later, he died in a hospital on Novemeber 6. .As per reports, bail for the suspect has been set at $1,000,000. Before the incident, the Jewish man was spotted waving an Israeli flag and suffered a head injury in the confrontation. Footage of the incident showed that two people, including a woman later came to help Kessler when he was seen lying on the pavement. Citing an autopsy, the sheriff office said that his manner of death was homicide. As per the authorities, the cause of death was a blunt force head injury. The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles claimed witnesses have informed that Kessler was struck with a megaphone just before his fall.Moshe Bryski, a rabbi informed The Post Tuesday that Kessler’s death was “a tragedy.” “You don’t expect people to go to a rally and not come home,” he said.the rabbi added that Kessler’s wife was “in a state of total shock” when he called. “He was not a closet Zionist — he wore it like a badge of honor. He was a proud Jew and proud Israel supporter,” Justin Cohen, family friend of the victime told The Post.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Hamas attack: Harvard students scramble to take back support for letter slamming Israel

A number of Harvard University students and organizations are scrambling to reverse their support for a letter that initially blamed Israel for the tragic events caused by Hamas terrorists. Some business leaders are also contemplating blacklisting these individuals from future job opportunities.Four of the original 34 student organizations associated with the contentious statement have already withdrawn their support. Additionally, board members of other groups have resigned to disassociate themselves from the letter.Late on Tuesday, an additional 17 Harvard groups, in addition to 500 faculty and staff members and around 3,000 others, signed a counter-statement condemning the initial letter as "completely wrong and deeply offensive," as reported by the Harvard Crimson.A third letter from nearly 160 faculty members criticized Harvard's response to the controversy, arguing that it "can be seen as nothing less than condoning the mass murder of civilians based only on their nationality."Some individuals in groups initially supporting the letter, which held "the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence," have also left while distancing themselves from the matter, the New York Post reported.Danielle Mikaelian, who identified herself as a board member of one of the student organizations that endorsed the statement, said that she had not seen the statement before and has since resigned from her position."I am sorry for the pain this caused," the law student continued. "My organization did not have a formal process, and I didn't even see the statement until we had signed on."Mikaelian also clarified that she prevented another student group she remains on the board of from signing the statement when she saw it, emphasizing that the statement did not represent her values.Law student Mohini Tangri also claimed that many members had no say in whether their organizations signed the letter and weren't even notified that their organizations were considering it.Several student organizations have released statements in recent days, formally retracting their signatures from the controversial statement.For instance, Harvard Ghungroo issued an Instagram statement apologizing for co-signing the statement made by the Harvard Palestinian Committee and formally retracting their signature. 
They clarified that they stand in solidarity with both Israeli and Palestinian victims and families, while denouncing the actions of Hamas, the New York Post report said.The Harvard Undergraduate Nepali Student Association also expressed regret for signing the letter, which had been interpreted as tacit support for violent attacks in Israel. They deplored the attacks and retracted their signature to ensure their stance on condemning violence by Hamas and supporting a just peace remains clear.Harvard College Act on a Dream cited miscommunication and a lack of due diligence for their endorsement of the statement and emphasized that it did not reflect their individual opinions about the situation in Palestine and Israel.The statement from the Harvard Palestinian Committee no longer lists the more than 30 student groups that initially signed it but notes that it was co-authored by a coalition of Palestine solidarity groups at Harvard.CEOs want to blacklist Harvard students for signing pro-Palestinian letterMeanwhile, many high-profile CEOs are urging Harvard University to disclose the identities of individuals from student organizations who signed a pro-Palestinian letter criticizing Israel.Billionaire Bill Ackman, a hedge fund manager and Harvard graduate, said in an online post on Tuesday that he had been approached by "several CEOs" inquiring if Harvard would reveal the list of students associated with the groups that issued a statement holding "the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence."According to a report in the Axios, other business leaders too supported Ackman's request, including Jonathan Neman, CEO of Sweetgreen, who commented on the post, stating, "I would like to know so I know never to hire these people."Jake Wurzak, CEO of DoveHill Capital Management, also responded, saying, "I second this." FabFitFun's CEO, Michael Broukhim, chimed in, saying, "We are in as well." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Through Abed Salama, I wanted to make you feel viscerally what it is to live in Gaza: Nathan Thrall

Jerusalem-based journalist and former director of think tank International Crisis Group Nathan Thrall usesa family's search for their son to delve into the complexities of the Israel-Palestine conflict in his new book 'A Day in the Life of Abed Salama: Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy.' He speaks about the human tragedy unfolding in West AsiaThrough the story of a father's frantic search for his son after a school bus crash, you've captured the realities of life under occupation. Why did you choose this particular story?I deliberately chose something seemingly ordinary, because it was important for me to bring attention to the daily lives of Israelis and Palestinians, and the system that they are both living under. A system in which there are seven million Palestinians and seven million Israeli Jews all living under Israeli control, where the vast majority of Palestinians don't have basic civil rights. 
When the issue is reported, there is a tendency to attend to it only when there is great violence as we see now in Gaza. The instinct is to call for a restoration of calm as it existed before the eruption of violence. I wanted to draw attention to the system that exists prior to that violence to show the root causes driving all of these eruptions of violence. The only way to do that was to choose something that could not be exceptionalised. If you chose an attack or war, there would be all kinds of micro questions about what particularly led to this outbreak at this time, and that's not really the most important question. The most important question: What is denying millions of people their freedom? What can we do to change the system to stop this horrific bloodshed?You've shown the delayed Israeli response to a bus full of burning kindergarteners but you don't blame them for it. Why?The mission of this book is to put you in the shoes of these people, and to make you feel viscerally what it is to actually live in this place, and through their stories and their family histories to tell the entire story of Israel-Palestine. And what comes through in the story of the accident, as in so many stories in Israel-Palestine, is that there is a system in place that is cruel, and that system is entirely delivered as a result of policy decisions. Israel has set a policy goal of minimising the number of Palestinians and maximising the number of Jews and with that in mind, a 26-ft tall concrete wall has been erected and those on the other side live in gross neglect. I do not blame the individuals who are trapped within the system, both Jews and Palestinians, because the system is created in such a way. The accident embodies that neglect and puts it into the starkest way on the worst day of these people's lives. Suddenly, the very foreseeable consequences of that neglect became the difference between life and death for some of these children.Are you concerned by the adverse reaction the book may draw from Jews?Some felt that the book was so prescient because it talks of the dehumanisation that both peoples have experienced, and the scars of the violence and brutality they have endured. I tell the story of young Israelis who celebrate in online posts the deaths of innocent kindergarteners on this school bus, and how an Israeli liberal TV news anchor was so horrified by the celebrations that he created a TV feature about it in order to hold up a mirror to his own society. So, on one hand, there are the deep scars of dehumanisation for both Palestinians and Israelis that unfortunately is resonating so much with the events that we are seeing now. On the other, there are members of right-wing pro-Israel groups who did not want to see this book published in the first place and are using the fact of the attack on October 7 to attempt to quash any nuanced discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian issue. They would like to create an environment that makes it impossible for anyone to say anything other than that we condemn the October 7 attack. The attack must be condemned. But we must also condemn the collective punishment of millions of people in Gaza, being deprived of food, water and electricity and a grossly unjust system that exists today.How will this week's events shape equations in the Middle East?We are at the very beginning of this war, and we are undoubtedly going to see a great deal more violence. I think the Israel-Saudi peace talks is one of the things that has made Palestinians feel that their situation is utterly desperate and that they have been totally abandoned. What they had thought were their natural, close and long-standing allies-the Arab states - have one by one abandoned them to pursue their self-interest of having a closer relationship with Israel and the US. And that desperation among Palestinians is very dangerous, and is one of the factors underlying all of the violence that we see now. But I don't see any reason why this war would prevent normalisation of Israeli-Saudi ties.Do you think there can be a return to status quo?Anytime there is an eruption of violence, there are calls to return to the status quo. The message of this book is that the status quo is unacceptable. Its aim was to look at that status quo and to force us to live, breathe and smell what the people that lived that status-quo experience go through, and to see that it's a catastrophe. We are doomed to continue to see this horrible bloodshed if we do not turn our attention toward the moral catastrophe of the status quo.You were born in California. How did you end up living in Jerusalem?I did a recorded piece while I was living as a journalist in New York working for the New York Review of Books. I was sent to do a reported piece on the West Bank about the efforts by the United States to train the Palestinian security forces to help Israel better control the West Bank and perpetuate the status quo. And that piece was published in Fall 2010. It was called Our Man in Palestine and it focused a lot on Palestine National Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad who was leading those efforts. Many in Washington were very enthusiastic about this effort as being the answer that the US would support Israel and the PA security forces in building up a more robust system of cooperation. But what I highlighted in that piece was that the system had no chance of leading to Palestinian freedom and it was in fact designed to help better perpetuate the occupation. And as a result of the publication of the piece, I was contacted by the International Crisis Group which asked me if I would be interested in writing the same sort of thing for them as the staff member and they asked me where I would like to go for a trial period to write a report for them. They sent me to Gaza since I told them that that was the place I most wanted to go. I went to Gaza in Fall 2010 within weeks of the publication of this article, and I lived there for a month and a half and began working for the International Crisis Group. They liked the report that I produced. A few months later I moved with my wife and six week old daughter to Jerusalem and we've been living there ever since. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Pitch invader with ‘Free Palestine’ message interrupts match

For a brief while, the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict cast a brief shadow on cricket, that too in a World Cup final. In a major security breach during the high-profile final, a pitch invader — a man clad in red shorts and white T-shirt with the messages ‘Stop bombing Palestine’ and ‘Free Palestine’ — invaded the pitch and came close to hugging Virat Kohli while he was batting in the middle during the 14th over. The man was wearing a face mask in the colours of the Palestine flag.Police detained the man identified as Wen Johnson, 24, an Australian citizen of Chinese-Filipino origin. 
The man crossed the fence and sprinted towards Kohli, got his arm around the former India captain and tried hugging him, before the security authorities apprehended him.He managed to elude multiple layers of security — there were almost 6,000 police person-nel on the ground — to make his way to the middle.The incident, which left the local cricket authorities shocked, was witnessed by close to 1,30,000 spectators in the stadium and millions of TV viewers across the globe.“Something like this has never happened at this stadium (after it was refurbished). We were surprised. Yes, it was a security breach. The cops have taken him to the local (Chandkheda) police station,” Gujarat Cricket Association secretary Anil Patel told TOI.Sources in the police said that Johnson is a TikTok prank-ster who had earlier invaded the field at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium during an annual rugby league series in 2020, after which he was fined Australian $220. In August, he repeated the act during FIFA women’s World Cup at Sydney.This is the second case of pitch invasion in the tournament, and both times, it involved a match between India and Australia. When the teams clashed at the Chepauk in Chennai last month, Daniel Jarvis, a serial pitch invader, ran into the field wearing the India jersey and went to speak to Kohli.Later on Sunday evening, Chandkheda police filed a complaint of voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty and criminal trespassing against Johnson. During primary questioning, Johnson told cops that he sprinted towards Kohli and put his arm around him as he is a big fan of him.(With inputs by Ashish Chauhan) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Thousands of protestors gathered in London on Saturday displaying Palestinian flags. They were advocating for an end to Israel's military operations in Gaza. The police had warned that people showing support for the Hamas terrorist group or any other terror organizations would face arrest. 
The protest, with participants holding signs reading "Free Palestine" and "End the Massacre," started near the BBC News world headquarters at Oxford Circus and was intended to conclude at the official residence of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Downing Street.The demonstrators criticized the US and UK governments for supporting Israel, even though the police had previously issued warnings that individuals displaying flags in support of Hamas or other terrorist groups would face arrest, as per the Times of Israel. London's Metropolitan Police Service announced plans to deploy over 1,000 officers at the rally.Ismail Patel, chairman of the Friends of Al-Aqsa campaign, said at the demonstration, "I think all just people around the world, not just in Britain, must stand up and call for this madness (to end)". "Otherwise, in the next few days, (we) might see a catastrophe unfolding," he added.A 22 year-old student, Belal Stitan, said he was terrified for his relatives in Gaza."No one in Gaza is OK. My family are all in Gaza and none of them are okay" he told Reuters. "This situation is a big, big problem for humanity and for me to have to say to the world, remember that we are human beings ... I can't believe that we are here."Earlier, the BBC headquarters in London was vandalized with red paint. A group known as Palestine Action claimed responsibility for the act and criticized the broadcaster, calling it 'manufacturing consent for Israel's war crimes'.The demonstration started at a time when Israel was intensifying its offensive against Gaza, accompanied by the deployment of tens of thousands of troops in close proximity, leading up to a potential ground operation.The Israeli military offensive came after a surprise attack from Hamas on October 7. Hamas infiltrated the Israeli border with hundreds of fighters, captured hostages and brutally killed over 1,300 civilians, who were either on the streets, in their homes, or at a party.In the UK, anyone convicted of providing support to Hamas can potentially face a prison sentence of up to 14 years.Israeli airstrikes have resulted in the complete destruction of entire neighborhoods in Gaza, causing residents to desperately seek refuge. These attacks have been carried out while Hamas militants warned that they would execute a hostage for every household targeted, without any prior notice of Israel's impending bombings.

NEW DELHI: A massive blast on Tuesday rocked a Gaza City hospital packed with wounded and other Palestinians seeking shelter, killing at least 500 people, the Hamas-run health ministry said. Hamas blamed an Israeli airstrike, while the Israeli military said a rocket was misfired by some Palestinian militants.President Joe Biden is headed for Israel in a bid to stop the ongoing war from escalating further, but called off the Jordan leg of his trip after regional summit in Amman was cancelled in the wake of the Gaza blast.Hamas and Israel trade blame post blastHamas called Tuesday's hospital blast "a horrific massacre," saying it was caused by an Israeli strike.The Israeli military, however, blamed Islamic Jihad, a smaller, more radical Palestinian militant group that often works with Hamas. The military said Islamic Jihad militants had fired a barrage of rockets near the hospital and that "intelligence from multiple sources" indicated the group was responsible.Islamic Jihad dismissed these claims, accusing Israel of "trying hard to evade responsibility for the brutal massacre it committed." The group pointed to Israel's order that Al-Ahli be evacuated and its previous bombing of the hospital complex as proof that the hospital was an Israeli target. 
It also said the scale of the explosion, the angle of the bomb's fall and the extent of the destruction all pointed to Israel.Israeli military urges Gaza City residents to evacuate southwardThe Israeli military urged Gaza City residents to relocate southward on Wednesday, saying in a new evacuation advisory that there was a "humanitarian zone" with aid available in Al-Mawasi, 28 km (17 miles) down the coast of the Palestinian enclave."The IDF calls on #GazaCity residents to evacuate south for their protection," said a social-media post by the military.Hamas playing victim after killing hundreds: Israeli envoy to IndiaIsraeli Ambassador to India, Naor Gilon on Wednesday reiterated the Israeli Prime Minister's claim that the Hospital in Gaza was attacked by an Islamic Jihad rocket and said that after killing hundreds of civilians, Hamas was portraying itself as "victims".Taking to X, he said, "THE HOSPITAL IN GAZA WAS HIT BY AN ISLAMIC JIHAD ROCKET!! This ability of the Palestinians to invade 30 Jewish communities, slaughter 1400+ Israelis, kidnap more than 200, shoot 7000+ rockets at Israeli civilians and still play the victim is amazing. The 'eagerness' of some in the world to accept these lies by #HamasISIS is disappointing but not necessarily surprising."Russia says Israel should provide evidence it didn't strike Gaza hospital Russia's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that a strike on a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians was a shocking crime, adding that Israel should provide satellite images to prove that it was not involved in the attack.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Radio Sputnik that the attack was a shocking "dehumanising" crime.UN's Antonio Guterres calls for 'immediate humanitarian ceasefire'UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Wednesday for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire" in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza."I call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to... ease the epic human suffering we are witnessing," Guterres told a forum of the Belt and Road infrastructure project in Beijing.'Biden to ask tough questions as a true friend of Israel'President Joe Biden will touch down in Israel on Wednesday for a diplomatic scramble to prevent the war with Hamas from spiraling into an even larger conflict, a challenge that became more difficult as outrage swept through the Middle East over an explosion that killed hundreds in a Gaza Strip hospital.Biden was originally scheduled to visit Jordan as well, but his meetings with Arab leaders were called off as he was leaving Washington, costing him an opportunity for the face-to-face conversations that he views as crucial for navigating this fraught moment. US National Security Council (NSC) coordinator for strategic communications, John Kirby, said, "When he [Biden] talks to PM Netanyahu, he'll be asking some tough questions, as a true friend of Israel. He's also going to make it clear that we continue to want to see this conflict not expand, not deepen...He will address the humanitarian situation in Gaza, making it clear, that we want to see humanitarian assistance flow in."UN to vote on Gaza resolution condemning Hamas attacks, violence against civilians  The UN Security Council scheduled a Wednesday vote on a resolution that initially condemned "the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas" on Israel as well as all violence against civilians, while calling for "humanitarian pauses" to deliver desperately needed aid to millions in Gaza.Negotiations on wording of the draft resolution sponsored by Brazil continued throughout Tuesday, and the final version to be voted on had not been released by late Tuesday.The vote follows the council's rejection Monday evening of a Russian-drafted resolution that condemned violence and terrorism against civilians and called for a "humanitarian cease-fire" but made no mention of Hamas.Police use tear gas as protesters swarm US embassy in BeirutHundreds of Lebanese protesters, some of whom were waving Palestinian flags, gathered outside the US embassy in Beirut on Tuesday evening. This demonstration was in response to the massive explosion at a Gaza City hospital. Police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators. Protesters in Beirut also descended on the French embassy. The protesters, many concealing their faces with Palestinian keffiyeh scarves, chanted slogans such as "Death to America" and "Death to Israel."These protests occurred shortly after Lebanon-based terror group Hezbollah called for a "day of rage" in Beirut in response to the deadly explosion at the Gaza medical center. "Let tomorrow, Wednesday, be a day of rage against the enemy," Hezbollah said in a statement. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

While India has been calling for an early resolution of the conflict, it has so far not called for a ceasefire. "Both leaders expressed their shared concern at terrorism, violence and loss of civilian lives," the government statement said.Modi reiterated India's "long-standing and principled" position on the Israel-Palestine issue in the form of its support to negotiations for a two-state solution. The PM also highlighted India's development partnership and humanitarian aid for the people of Palestine. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Former Israeli PM Bennett destroys news anchor in heated exchange over Gaza crisis

In a heated clash, Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett engaged in a debate with MSNBC host Katy Tur and the international community on Monday regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict's history, reported Fox News. As Israel responded to the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks with military strikes and a ground invasion of Gaza, the international community expressed objections, claiming Israel's methods were disproportionate and genocidal, a critique that raised concerns among many Israelis.Katy Tur expressed her sorrow over the plight of children and the overall violence resulting from the October 7 attack, before questioning Bennett, "But I’m sure that there are Palestinians who can show images of their own children who have tragically perished in this conflict. Many in the world are calling for a ceasefire. 
Several allies are advocating for at least a temporary pause, if not a ceasefire through a U.N. vote. Why do you think so much of the world is urging Israel to halt its actions?"Bennett admitted that he did not have a clear answer but suggested that Israel was being held to a different standard. He offered a hypothetical scenario, saying, "Imagine if America, instead of Mexico, had a state of Al-Qaeda, with 240 American hostages, including babies, there, and this Al-Qaeda state entered Florida and committed heinous acts. Would anyone ask America to cease fire against this Al-Qaeda state?"Highlighting the history of Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and Hamas' subsequent takeover after elections, Bennett argued that many Israelis had hoped that improving Palestinian lives would reduce tensions. However, he claimed that the opposite had occurred, leading to what he described as a "nightmare." Bennett firmly stated that Israel could no longer tolerate any Hamas presence near its borders.Katy Tur raised the idea of a two-state solution as a potential long-term resolution to the conflict, allowing Gazans to have "everything that a nation enjoys on their land." Bennett rejected this proposal, asserting that it had been attempted previously and had failed. He pointed out, "Until 2005, Israel occupied Gaza. In 2005, we pulled out of Gaza, back to the 1967 borders, and handed the entire territory over to the Palestinian Authority. They had the chance to create the Palestinian state everyone talks about, but instead, they focused on attacking us."Tur countered, implying that the Gaza government's non-state status contributed to the radicalization of Hamas. She argued that Gazans hadn't had a vote in 17 years due to Hamas's control, and the region wasn't connected to the West Bank. Bennett, however, emphasized the realities on the ground, stating, "But that's beside the point. We're talking about Gaza. The West Bank is the West Bank, and Gaza is Gaza. They got everything they wanted. Israelis left and right, there's a consensus; no one wants to experiment with dangerous strategies again." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'Dead man walking': Israel set on eliminating Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar

NEW DELHI: An Israeli air strike has killed senior Hamas commander Ayman Nofal in Gaza, the Hamas' armed wing Izz el-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades said on Tuesday. Nofal, who was in charge of the Central Gaza area in the armed wing, is the eighth top leader of Hamas to be killed in the airstrikes that started over a week ago. Israel's ongoing bombardment in Gaza Strip has claimed thousands of Palestinian lives, including hundreds of children.Despite Israel's marginal success in removing the top leadership of Hamas, the organisation's  leader Yahya Sinwar remains elusive.Referred to by Israel as the 'Butcher of Khan Younis' for his violent and cruel torture methods against his enemies, Sinwar is widely seen as being the mastermind of the October 7 attack that killed over 1,600 Israelis. "That man is in our sights," Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Lt. 
Col. Richard Hecht told journalists over the weekend. "Sinwar is the leader of Hamas in Gaza and he's a dead man walking ... We will get to him, however long it takes ... and this war could be long," he said.Sinwar is believed to be somewhere in the Palestinian enclave but hidden deep underground in the warren of tunnels Hamas uses to transport weapons and fighters and where they may even be keeping the hostages.All you need to know about Yahya Sinwar Sinwar was born in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in 1962, when the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule.His family were expelled from Al-Majdal Asqalan (Ashkelon) during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. He finished his studies at the Islamic University of Gaza where he received a bachelor's degree in Arabic Studies.He joined Hamas not long after its founding in 1987.Two years later he was arrested by Israel for his involvement in the abduction and killing of two Israelis, as well as the torturing and murder of four Palestinians he considered to be collaborators.Sentenced to life in prison, Sinwar ended up serving 22 years in an Israeli jail and was eventually released as part of a prisoner exchange for the abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.He became a prominent leader of Hamas prisoners and was a very influential figure among all Palestinian prisoners.After being returned to Gaza as part of the Shalit deal, Sinwar became a popular leader in Hamas, and in 2017 was elected by secret ballot to replace the incumbent political leader, Ismail Haniyeh.During his time in jail Sinwar learned to speak Hebrew fluently and knows Israeli society very well.This is not the first time that Sinwar is in Israel's sights. In 2018, following the announcement by President Donald Trump that he would move the US embassy to Jerusalem, mass protests broke out in Gaza along the border fence with Israel. Known as the Great March of Return, Israel said Sinwar was instigating the unrest and encouraging thousands of Palestinians to try and break through into Israel to harm civilians. In regards to the October 7 attack, Israel believes Sinwar purposely misled regional partners such as Egypt and Qatar into believing that he was more focused on relieving the humanitarian crisis for the enclave's 2.1 million residents than drawing Israel into a war. Retired Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, Israeli army spokesman, told Fox News Digital that the army had "no doubt" Sinwar was the "mastermind of this massacre.""He coordinated the entire institution of Hamas, the government, and the military wing," said Lerner. "He is the financier, the instructor and he gave the ultimate green light to carry this out." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Tension rise in US universities amid Israel-Hamas war

NEW DELHI: Students at American universities are divided over complex issues surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict. It's not a united front advocating for a singular cause but rather dueling protests and shouting matches. According to a report in USA Today, this surge in campus activism signifies a shift from past movements, with the Israel-Hamas conflict generating unprecedented engagement among college students. 
Experts attribute this to an increasingly divisive social media environment and nuanced dynamics surrounding the issue.The intensity of these debates has left students and parents alarmed and prompted criticism of how universities handle the situation. Pro-Palestinian activists have reported harassment, while Jewish students face rising antisemitic posts on social media and protests.Debates revolve around questions of whether Hamas's actions were justified, Israel's right to self-defense, treatment of Palestinians, and the distinction between criticisms of Israel and attacks against Jews, US Today reported.According to the report, this activism is widespread, with students, alumni, and faculty joining in. The situation has led some Jewish students to seek support from their Hillel chapters, and it’s prompting institutions to grapple with the challenge of upholding free speech while maintaining campus safety.Divergent ViewsUnlike past movements such as the fight against apartheid or the Vietnam War, the Israel-Hamas debate is marked by a lack of consensus among students. A recent survey suggests that opinions among college students vary, with a majority believing Israel has a right to exist but differing on their interpretation of events. This ambiguity has led to a more contentious environment on campuses, USA Today reported.This surge in activism has implications beyond campus boundaries. Some colleges are losing donor support, with accusations of antisemitism. Campuses have become battlegrounds for not only students but also influential business leaders pressuring institutions to address the issue. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'Jewish students barricade inside Cooper Union library as pro-Palestinian protesters bang on doors'

In a harrowing incident at the Cooper Union college in New York, Jewish students found themselves barricaded inside the university's library as pro-Palestinian protesters bypassed security and aggressively banged on the building's doors. The protesters, displaying anti-Zionist posters and shouting what was described as "anti-Semitic rhetoric," created a scene of chaos and fear.A Jewish senior from the East Village institution vividly described the terrifying ordeal. As the demonstrators slammed posters against the window and began pounding on the door, she felt an overwhelming sense of dread. 
"When they started banging on the door, my heart started pounding. I was crying. I think if the doors weren't locked - I don't know what would have happened," she confided to The New York Post, choosing to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the situation.The protesters, armed with Palestinian flags and signs reading "Zionism Hands off our Universities," had initially planned a 1 p.m. demonstration outside the building. However, they unexpectedly decided to move inside. Their initial trajectory seemed to be towards the office of university President Laura Sparks, presumably to demand a condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza. But they suddenly changed direction towards the library."We have been in contact with the NYPD and Cooper Union leadership about the situation that unfolded on campus. The NYPD was present on scene and was coordinating with school security during the entire event, ensuring no one was injured," New York City Mayor Eric Adams said on X, formerly known as Twitter."While the students at Cooper Union have a right to peacefully protest, hate has no place in our city," Adams added.Videos from the scene show the group, chanting "Free Palestine," effortlessly moving past security and ascending the stairs. Security personnel on the library's 7th level managed to lock the doors in time, preventing the protesters from entering. However, this didn't deter them from banging on the walls and continuing their chants.Several of the 11 Jewish students trapped inside the library reached out to 911 or contacted family members who then called the police. Although the NYPD was present at the demonstration, no arrests or summonses were made, and the protesters eventually left the building without any further incidents, the Post report said.The student witness claimed that the police never arrived on the scene because the university advised against their involvement. Instead, a school administrator offered to discreetly escort the students out of the building's back entrance.After the protest, some Jewish students decided to remain inside the library. When they eventually emerged, they were met with a silent display of pro-Palestinian demonstrators showcasing their signs.Kim Newman, the university's media relations manager, said that the library was temporarily closed for about 20 minutes during the protest.

Gaza health infra at breaking point amid intense air strikes

Israel intensified its overnight bombing of southern Gaza, where officials said record number of 750 Palestinians were killed in 24 hours, as violence flared elsewhere in West Asia and a showdown loomed at the UN on Wednesday over desperately needed aid. The Palestinian death toll now exceeds 6,500, Gaza healthministry said WednesdayPalestinian anger over the toll has been inflamed further by a sense of betrayal as many of those who heeded Israel's call to move south are also being killed. The Israeli military says that Hamas, which seized control in Gaza in 2007, has entrenched itself among the civilian population everywhere. 
Israel said its latest strikes had eliminated more Hamas operatives including the head of the Islamist group's battalion for Khan Younis, Tayseer Bebasher. It said Hamas tunnel shafts, command centres, weapons caches and rocket launch positions were targeted, plus a cell of Hamas divers trying to infiltrate Israel by sea near Kibbutz Zikim.The UN warned on Wednesday that without more fuel it will soon sharply curtail relief operations. The UNRWA, the UN agency that aids Palestinians, desperately needs fuel to run nearly 150 shelters where 600,000 displaced Palestinians have sought safety, as well as health care clinics, said Juliette Touma, its spokeswoman. "The next 24 hours are going to be critical," Touma said. "After that, we are going to have to start choosing where to send the aid, and how often." The WHO said that 12 of Gaza's 35 hospitals were not functioning and that seven major hospitals were well over capacity, risking patient safety. The US and Russia are leading rival calls at the UN for a pause in fighting. In proposals the UNSC was expected to consider on Wednesday, the US is seeking short pauses to allow aid in while Russia advocates a wider ceasefire. Israel has resisted both, arguing that Hamas would only take advantage. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israel-Hamas Conflict: Dead bodies being stored in ice-cream trucks in Gaza

NEW DELHI: As the death toll continuously rises in the Gaza Strip, health officials began storing dead bodies of Palestinians killed in the war in ice-cream trucks because the cemeteries are reportedly short of space, reported ReutersAfter the Hamas attack on Israel last weekend, October 7, Israel has unleashed a fierce bombing on the Gaza Strip leading to the death of several Palestinians. The situation in Palestine has become so bad that there are shortages of cemeteries in the country forcing them to store the body in ice-cream trucks. Talking about the shortage of resources, Dr. Yasser Ali of the Shuhada Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah said that the hospital morgue can only take 10 bodies, so they have brought in ice cream freezers from the ice cream factories to store them. 
Ironically, the outer shell of the truck shows photographs of children enjoying ice cream, and inside that truck, several sad, helpless dead bodies were kept. The Israeli military said on Sunday it would still allow Gazans to evacuate south ahead of an expected ground assault in retaliation for the attacks eight days ago by Hamas gunmen, who killed 1,300 people in Israel.Authorities in Gaza said Israeli air strikes had killed more than 2,300 people, a quarter of them children, with nearly 10,000 wounded so far. Hospitals are running short of supplies and struggling to cope with growing numbers of wounded, as per ReutersIsrael has vowed to remove Hamas from its roots after its fighters rampaged through Israeli towns shooting men, women, and children and seizing hostages. That means the Gaza death toll will rise sharply."Even with these freezers, the number (of the dead) exceeds the capacity of this main morgue of the hospital, and alternative ones, and between 20 and 30 bodies are being kept in tents too," said Ali, as he opened the doors of the freezers to show the white-shrouded bodies inside.Ali further added that the Gaza Strip is in crisis and if this war continues there will be no one to bury the dead. The cemeteries are already full and we need new ones to bury the dead," Ali said.In Gaza City too, authorities were preparing mass graves, said the head of the Government Media Office, Salama Marouf."In light of the large number of martyrs inside the morgues of Al-Shifa Hospital, whose relatives did not arrive to bury them, signs of change began to appear on the bodies," he said."And in light of the continued arrival of martyrs in their dozens as a result of the occupation's massacres, a mass grave has been prepared to bury approximately 100 martyrs in the emergency cemetery."

NEW DELHI: Security was beefed up ahead of the Friday prayers at Jama Masjid in old Delhi in response to intelligence reports suggesting the potential for disruptions amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas. There was a visible police presence at the mosque as people congregated for prayers.Talking to TOI before the prayers, Shahi imam Ahmed Bukhari said over phone, "The Israeli conflict is an emotional issue. People are angry. 
But I am not going to speak about it at the prayers. I have also called others in other cities and asked them not to organise any processions."He added, "We have apprehensions that people might raise slogans after the prayers end. We will be careful to not allow outsiders to create any unnecessary situations."Most people at the mosque expressed support for Palestine. Mohammad Haneef said, "We are looking at what happened now. But one should see the past thousand years of history. Israel has always been an aggressor."Seeing Haneef speaking to the media, a group gathe red. Another person said, "Our former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee supported Palestine. People are not looking at what Israel has been doing for so many years. America and Israel are two sides of the same coin." Old Delhi resident Idrish chipped in, "Ultimately, America wants to sell weapons so it is fuelling such hostilities."In the Walled City, most people told TOI that they did not have much to do with the Israel-Hamas war. Mahmood Alam of Dariba Kalan said, "We have our own problems to sort out. There are electricity wires hanging over our heads across old Delhi. We want this to be sorted out rather than worry about political tensions in other parts of the world."Sabina said, "Have you seen the Walled City? There are traffic jams, overflowing drains, The politicians keep saying at every election that things will improve, but nothing does. We care more about our area. Politicians across the globe are the same, they cause strife to be able to rule."Delhi Police enhanced security arrangements in the city on Friday after receiving intelligence inputs about the possibility of some kind of disruptive activities in sensitive areas of the capital.

'Day of Resistance' campus rally sparks fear among Jewish students at University of Washington

NEW DELHI: Tensions at the University of Washington escalated recently when a "Day of Resistance" rally for Palestinians left Jewish students terrified and in tears. The rally was advertised with an image of a paraglider, reminiscent of those used by Hamas terrorists in their attacks on Israelis, reported the New York Post.In distressing video footage, a student is seen tearfully pleading with a university administrator to stop the rally. The student, whose tears were evident, implored, "They want our people dead. They want us killed," but the administrator responded that he couldn't intervene, leaving the distraught student in a state of despair.Videos posted online captured confrontations between students with opposing views, with one student proclaiming that Israel is "finished" and another resorting to offensive language towards a pro-Israeli student, calling them a "f-king rapist."According to KOMO, campus security had to intervene in a couple of instances to prevent these clashes.The pro-Palestinian rally was organized by a student group with the stated goal of "uplifting the just Palestinian resistance" and "condemning the settler colonial state of Israel.Organizers emphasized that they do not support Hamas but rather stand behind Palestinians defending themselves, as perThe event's promotional materials featured a drawing of a paraglider, similar to those used by Hamas in a recent attack on southern Israel. 
This event came shortly after the tragic death of a University of Washington alumnus, Hayim Katsman, who was among those killed in the Hamas attacks. Katsman was conducting research on a kibbutz, where he was found murdered in his apartment.Many Jewish students have family ties to Israel, and some have expressed their concerns. One student, Nina Carmeli, shared her distress over the rally, saying, "[They] went missing for four days... They were found on Tuesday murdered."Rabbi Mendel Weingarten of Chabad at the University of Washington told KOMO that students and parents have reached out to them, expressing their fear and insecurity. He said, "Almost every student there has a first- or second-degree connection to someone who was either murdered, missing, or is fighting on the front lines."Some Jewish students have reported feeling afraid to openly display their Star of David necklaces or yarmulkes. They also expressed disappointment with what they perceive as a tepid response from the university administration.University President Ana Mari Cauce issued a statement acknowledging the devastating situation in Israel and Gaza. She said, "The tragic reality is that civilians have borne and will bear the brunt of this violence. The terror, loss of life and outbreak of war in Israel and Gaza over the weekend, which began with the reprehensible attacks by Hamas, is devastating to all of us, and my heart is with every member of our community who has ties to or loved ones in this deeply troubled region. The tragic reality is that civilians have borne and will bear the brunt of this violence. In their attacks, Hamas has killed hundreds of civilians and taken scores more hostage. And many more in Israel and Gaza continue to die as the violence escalates. Every life claimed by this conflict is a tragedy."However, some students found her statement to be insufficient.One student, Aidan Dveirin, criticized the university's "both-sides-ism"and called for a more robust response, in a statement to KOMO. He argued that the conflict is rooted in the desire to annihilate the Jewish state and that Hamas is using innocent lives as human shields. "This isn't about freedom, this isn't about land rights, this isn't about occupation," continued. "This is about right and wrong." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Yale's campus newspaper criticized for censoring report on Hamas atrocities against Jews

Yale University's campus newspaper, the Yale Daily News, has come under fire for censoring a pro-Israel columnist by removing what it deemed "unsubstantiated claims that Hamas raped women and beheaded men" from a recent column, reported The New York Post. The controversy has sparked a heated debate on campus and in the wider community about freedom of expression and journalistic integrity.The incident occurred when the Yale Daily News removed references to alleged atrocities committed by Hamas in an opinion piece titled "Is Yalies4Palestine a hate group?" authored by sophomore Sahar Tartak, the editor in chief of the rival campus newspaper, Yale Free Press. 
In response to the censorship, Tartak took to her social media account to express her dismay, and she shared a comment by Yale professor Nicholas Christakis, who questioned the validity of such claims.Tartak's column was published just five days after a Hamas massacre on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,400 Israelis. The attack occurred during a music festival near the Israel-Gaza border fence, where Hamas terrorists infiltrated the area using hang-gliders and pickup trucks. In her article, Tartak condemned the student group Yalies4Palestine, which had posted messages on Instagram blaming Israel for the atrocities.Yalies4Palestine's official Instagram page contained a post immediately following the Hamas attack, holding "the Israeli Zionist regime responsible for the unfolding violence." Another social media post from the group encouraged the Yale community to celebrate "the resistance's success" and expressed full support for the Palestinian people's right to resist colonization while dismissing nonviolent acts of resistance as ineffective.The controversy surrounding the column escalated due to the claims of heinous acts committed by Hamas, such as beheadings and sexual violence against women. Israeli authorities have reported the recovery of beheaded bodies of infants killed by Hamas gunmen who invaded towns along the Gaza Strip's frontier. They also disclosed a handwritten note found on a Hamas terrorist encouraging the removal of heads, hearts, and livers from their Israeli victims.However, the veracity of these claims has been met with skepticism, prompting the Yale Daily News to issue an editor's note on October 25, stating that Tartak's column "has been edited to remove unsubstantiated claims that Hamas raped women and beheaded men."This incident comes amid ongoing tensions in the region, with Israeli President Isaac Herzog confirming the tragic death of Shani Nicole Louk, a German-Israeli tattoo artist kidnapped by Hamas. Her brutal murder, which involved her beheading, has shocked the international community. Israeli military personnel involved in search and rescue operations have reported the discovery of beheaded bodies, including infants, near the Gaza Strip's border.The controversy surrounding the Yale Daily News and the broader debate over the claims in Tartak's column underscore the sensitivity and complexity of the Israel-Palestine conflict and the importance of responsible journalism when covering such issues. Hamas has denied allegations of killing infants and other heinous acts, further complicating the situation and highlighting the need for rigorous investigation and fact-checking in reporting on this conflict.

He is a lawyer by profession and earned a degree in Arabic studies from the Islamic University of Gaza.Sinwar is considered to be the defence minister of Hamas and has always advocated armed struggle against Israel. He is considered to be the mastermind behind recent Hamas attacks in Israel, according to IDF’s spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner. 61-year-old Sinwar has spent over 23 years in Israeli prisons before being released in 2011 in a prisoner exchange involving French-Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been held captive by Hamas.

NEW DELHI: Israeli soldiers engaged in combat with Hamas militants a day after an unprecedented surprise attack by Hamas forces that broke out of the blockaded Gaza Strip and invaded nearby Israeli communities. On Sunday, Israel responded with airstrikes that leveled buildings in Gaza, with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declaring that the country was at war.Hamas militants had launched a broad assault on Saturday, infiltrating as many as 22 locations outside the Gaza Strip, including towns and communities up to 15 miles from the Gaza border. Simultaneously, Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israeli cities, resulting in casualties and taking hostages. 
Here are all the latest developments from Day 2 of the conflict:Israeli forces clash with Hamas gunmenIsrael was still countering Hamas incursions in eight locations, according to the Israeli military. The situation remained tense. The conflict has been spreading, with fire from Lebanon into northern Israel, which the armed group Hezbollah said it carried out "in solidarity" with the Palestinian people.Hezbollah and Israel exchange fire Situation escalated as Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, became involved. This raised concerns of a broader regional conflict.  Hezbollah conducted strikes on Israeli positions in a disputed area near Syria's Golan Heights, leading to a military response from Israel in the form of armed drone strikes on Hezbollah targets in the same disputed area where the borders of Israel, Lebanon, and Syria converge.This escalation on Israel's northern border raised the possibility of involving a formidable adversary of Israel, Hezbollah, which is supported by Iran and is believed to possess tens of thousands of rockets.About 500 Israelis and Palestinians deadIsrael conducted strikes on 426 targets in Gaza, including residential buildings, resulting in significant destruction. The Palestinian Health Ministry reported at least 256 people killed in Gaza, including 20 children, and nearly 1,800 wounded.In response to the attack, Israel saw its deadliest day in decades, with at least 300 people killed and 1,500 wounded, according to Israeli media. Israel PM Netanyahu vows to turn Hamas hideouts into rubbleAs the death toll from the Hamas rocket attacks and ground assault surpassed 300, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a resolute pledge to obliterate all known hiding places of the militant organization, vowing to reduce them to rubble.Netanyahu issued a warning to all residents of Gaza, urging them to evacuate immediately. He declared that Israel would employ its full military might to eliminate Hamas's capabilities.Netanyahu wrote on Twitter, "The IDF will immediately use all its strength to destroy Hamas's capabilities. We will destroy them and will exact forceful retribution for this dark day they have imposed upon the State of Israel and its citizens. As Bialik wrote: 'Revenge for the blood of a little child has yet been devised by Satan'.""Regarding all the locations where Hamas is stationed, concealed, and operating, that malevolent city, we will reduce them to rubble. To the residents of Gaza, I say: Depart now, because we will take decisive action everywhere," he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

South Africa calls Brics summit to address Gaza situation; joint statement likely

Amid the raging Israel-Hamas conflict, leaders of Brics countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - will join on Tuesday a virtual Extraordinary Meeting on the West Asia situation along with their counterparts from newly added member-states - Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the UAE - said South Africa in an official announcement. While both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have confirmed participation, India is likely to be represented by foreign minister S Jaishankar in the meeting that will be chaired by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and will be followed by a joint statement on Gaza. UNSG Antonio Guterres, who has been calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, will also join the meeting. 
It will be interesting to see if India endorses any joint statement calling for a ceasefire since it had, unlike other Brics founding members, not backed a UNGA resolution for a ``humanitarian truce’’. While India had abstained from voting as the resolution didn’t explicitly condemn Hamas’ terrorist attacks, others had all voted in favour.In fact, even among the new members, all except Ethiopia had voted in favour of the resolution. Like India, Ethiopia had abstained. Ramaphosa said Monday that peace won’t be possible until the ``Palestinians are free’’.PM Narendra Modi had condemned the Hamas terror attacks on the very first day of the conflict and, walking the diplomatic tightrope, his government later sought to balance India’s position by underlining the significance of international humanitarian law, sending aid to Gaza and reiterating support for a 2-state solution.“President Ramaphosa will deliver opening remarks at the Brics Extraordinary Meeting, where member and invited States will also deliver country statements on the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza,’’ said South Africa in its announcement, adding that UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres will participate in the virtual meeting too. It further said that at the end of the summit leaders are expected to adopt a Joint Statement on the situation in the Middle East, with ``particular reference to Gaza”.According to South Africa, some 1200 people in Israel and a further 11,000 in Gaza have been killed since the beginning of the conflict on October 7.“As a government and as a people, we stand firm in our call for justice for the oppressed Palestinian people, for their rights and aspirations to be fulfilled, for the immediate cessation of hostilities, and for there to be accountability for the deplorable killings of civilians in this recent conflict. We maintain that peace will not be possible until Palestinians are free,'' said Ramaphosa. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Blinken shuttles from the West Bank to Iraq trying to contain the fallout from the Israel-Hamas war

RAMALLAH: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken continued his diplomatic efforts concerning the Israel-Hamas conflict by visiting the occupied West Bank on Sunday. During this visit, he held discussions with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, as part of the Biden administration's growing initiative to alleviate the suffering of Gaza's civilians during the Israeli bombardment and to outline a potential post-conflict plan for the region, as reported by the Associated Press.Subsequently, Blinken flew to Baghdad for talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, as American forces in the region contend with a rise in attacks by Iranian-allied militias in Iraq and various other locations. On Sunday, a US official confirmed that US forces had intercepted and downed another single-use attack drone that was being directed towards American and coalition troops near their base in Syria.President Joe Biden's top diplomat traveled through the West Bank city of Ramallah in a heavily protected convoy. It was the third day of shuttle diplomacy, with the objective of mitigating the destabilizing consequences of the regional conflict. 
The effort seeks to address the Israeli government's reluctance to consider intermittent ceasefires in its offensive against Hamas, allowing for the rapid delivery of crucial aid to the civilian population in Gaza.Blinken informed reporters, "This is an ongoing process. Israel has raised significant concerns regarding the logistics of implementing humanitarian pauses. We need to address these concerns, including their impact on the approximately 240 foreign hostages held by Hamas. We are actively working on these issues."The Biden administration, while remaining a staunch supporter of Israel's military response to Hamas' attacks on October 7, is increasingly using its influence to try and mitigate the impact of Israel's weeks-long, all-encompassing siege and almost constant air, ground, and sea operations in Gaza, a territory inhabited by 2.3 million civilians.Blinken's meeting with Abbas in the West Bank took place shortly after Israeli planes conducted an airstrike on a refugee camp in Gaza, resulting in the loss of at least 40 lives, as reported by health officials in Gaza. As news of Blinken's presence in Ramallah spread, Palestinians gathered to express their opposition to US backing of Israel's military campaign. Protesters displayed signs featuring images of dripping blood and messages such as "Blinken, blood is on your hands."Neither Blinken nor Abbas exchanged words when they met in front of the cameras, and their meeting concluded without any public statements.The Palestinian Authority governs semi-autonomous regions within the Israeli-occupied West Bank, but it has not had a presence in the Gaza Strip since 2007. In that year, Hamas took control of Gaza after winning elections there the previous year.Blinken emphasized the crucial role played by the Palestinian Authority in maintaining stability in the West Bank. He stressed the need for Palestinian voices to be central in shaping the future of Gaza, the West Bank, and the eventual Palestinian state.In contrast, Abbas stated that the Palestinian Authority would only take control in Gaza as part of a comprehensive political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He also condemned Israel's actions in Gaza as a "genocidal war" and urged Blinken to intervene and prevent such acts.During his second visit to the Middle East since the conflict started, Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, followed by discussions with Arab ministers in Jordan on Saturday. While Netanyahu has thus far opposed humanitarian pauses, Arab officials pressed for an immediate ceasefire. Blinken expressed concerns that an immediate ceasefire could be counterproductive and might encourage further violence by Hamas.US officials think Netanyahu might reconsider his opposition to a ceasefire if it aligns with Israel's strategic interests and helps Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The high Palestinian death toll, over 9,700, has led to global protests for an immediate ceasefire. Arab states resist a larger role in the crisis, placing blame on Israel for the situation in Gaza.Blinken stated that among Arab leaders, there is a consensus in favor of a humanitarian pause, which could facilitate various goals, including hostage release, humanitarian aid delivery, and evacuating foreign nationals. He acknowledged progress on this front in recent days but also noted some challenges that need to be addressed.In Baghdad, discussions also revolved around the security of US forces. Blinken emphasized the unacceptability of threats and attacks from Iran-aligned militias and committed to taking necessary measures to safeguard American personnel. The Iraqi prime minister also expressed his determination to halt militia attacks. Blinken is now heading to Turkey.The United States is deeply concerned that Iran and its proxy groups, including various militia organizations in Iraq, might exploit the situation in Gaza to further destabilize the Middle East. Iranian-backed militias have already escalated their rocket and other attacks on US military installations in Iraq and Syria, prompting at least one retaliatory strike by American forces, as the Associated Press reported.The recent drone attack on a US facility in Syria marked the 32nd attack on US and coalition military sites in Iraq and Syria since October 17. These attacks include at least 17 incidents in Iraq and 15 in Syria. While at least 21 service members have been injured in these attacks, all of them have since returned to their duties, according to the Pentagon.The drone strike, as confirmed by the same US official, exhibited striking similarities to previous attacks on US personnel in bases across Iraq and Syria. At this point, it is believed to be connected to Iranian-backed militia groups. The official, not authorized to publicly discuss the matter, shared this information on condition of anonymity.

NEW DELHI:  Shri Thanedar, an Indian-American Congressman, on Monday called Hamas the "barbaric terrorists" who should be eliminated with all its military capabilities dismantled.Speaking at an event in the US Capitol in support of Israel, Thanedar also highlighted the sufferings being born by the civilians in Gaza due to Israeli air strikes and called for their "freedom from the terrorist outfit"."Hamas is not a militant organization. Hamas is not a resistance movement, they are just barbaric terrorists. This is a time when we just can't just push them because they will regroup and come back and do these atrocities once again. 
Yes, that's what they will do. So you know, we need at this stage to eliminate them. Eliminate the space of this, you know, we need to dismantle their military operations," Thanedar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. "We need to free the Palestinian people, the two million Palestinian people that live in Gaza. They need to be freed from these terrorist controls of Gaza. So that addition is what I feel. Now there is a lot of talk about ceasefire, but I feel that it's premature, these Hamas terrorists have used the civilians," he added.Israel has claimed to have lost more than 1400 people in the sudden October 7 attack by Hamas that later took more than 200 people hostage in Gaza.Congressional briefing in support of Israel was organised by Multi-faith Alliance HinduACTion and Namaste Shalom. The gathering was also aimed to address the rising anti-Hindu bigotry and antisemitism in the US and Canada."Misused the civilians as a shield for them and unfortunately that's causing tremendous loss which is so regrettable. Tremendous loss of lives of innocent people. But these innocent people they need to have their future, they need to have their life, they need to have their human rights and they need to be freed from the oppression of Hamas and basically exploitation Hamas is doing of these innocent civilians in Gaza," said Thanedar.Shri Thanedar also highlighted the loss of civilian lives on both sides, Israel and Gaza and condemned the attacks on Israel.Condemning the attacks on Israel and pointing out the loss of lives on both sides (Gaza and Israel), Thandear said "Loss of civilian life, Whether it is Israeli civilian life or Palestinian civilian life should not happen, that's something that's never desirable and never got to come."Hamas officials in the Palestinian enclave claimed on Monday that Israeli strikes have killed at least 5,087 people in Gaza since the war erupted on October 7. On the other hand, the Israeli administration asserted that the Hamas attack has claimed over 1400 lives, adding that the terrorist outfit has taken more than 200 hostages.

Israel-Hamas conflict opens rifts within Democratic party

NEW DELHI: The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East is causing fractures within the progressive wing of the Democratic Party in New York. Tensions are spilling into the streets, leading to daily rallies and protests, and this turmoil could have significant implications for some of the nation's most prominent electoral offices.In the past, New York's deep-blue state has seen left-leaning candidates successfully unite various factions, including the far left, progressives, and traditional liberals, to secure citywide positions and challenge moderate Democrats in mayoral and gubernatorial races. According to a report in Politico, however, the current crisis in the Middle East is causing these groups to splinter over their positions regarding Hamas' surprise invasion and the Israeli government's response. “This has been an earthquake,” said an New York City Democratic official. 
"And a chasm has opened up between the left and the far left."The conflict's graphic and horrifying images from the front lines, such as the aftermath of a Gaza hospital strike, have intensified deeply held convictions surrounding Israel and the Palestinian territories. These divisions have been increasingly divisive within Democratic circles, especially in New York, and this tension is most acute within the party's progressive wing, Politico reported.On one end of this spectrum are the Democratic Socialists of America, who have long advocated for Palestinians and supported the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement against Israel. On the other side, numerous progressives and traditional liberals, including many Jewish members, mostly oppose BDS and express support for Israel. According to Politico, candidates have been able to bridge these divides in the past by focusing on shared ideals, such as higher taxes for the wealthy or stronger protections for renters, that bypassed the gulf on Israeli-Palestinian issues. However, the current state of the world has changed significantly in recent weeks.“The debate isn’t new, but as long as this conflict is in the headlines, it becomes a sharper knife’s edge,” said Gabe Tobias, a progressive political strategist in the city. "I think you saw that with the spectrum of left elected officials who were clearly putting a lot of thought into their reactions — they were not tweeting from the hip."Even with varying versions of this coalition intact, the left has struggled to gain electoral ground in New York, often losing out to moderates like New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Gov. Kathy Hochul, and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. However, if the conflict in the Middle East were to further divide the left, it could undermine the movement's progress and open the way for more moderate lawmakers to secure influential elected offices.Today, New York's Jewish population is about 1.6 million, making up about 21 percent of all Jews in the nation. However, support for Israel within the Democratic Party has waned over the past decade, particularly among younger, left-leaning members who tend to be more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.The ongoing conflict is amplifying these divisions further, with hostages in Gaza, revelations about the initial attack's brutality, and Israel preparing for a ground invasion amidst mounting Palestinian casualties and widespread destruction from rocket attacks in the occupied territory.Elected officials on the left are taking different stances as emotions run high. For example, on October 20, a number of elected officials endorsed by the DSA attended a pro-Palestinian rally and called for a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. In contrast, Congress members, representing large Jewish communities that have expressed support for Israel without providing full-throated backing for Israeli military action.

Who is shadowy Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif and what is 'Operation Al-Aqsa Storm'?

NEW DELHI: At least 100 Israelis and 200 Palestinians were killed after Hamas militants carried out a surprise multi-front attack on Israel on Saturday.In a recorded message, the shadowy leader of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, announced the start of what he called "Operation Al-Aqsa Storm." "Enough is enough," he said in the message, as he called on Palestinians from east Jerusalem to northern Israel to join the fight. "Today the people are regaining their revolution."Deif's message was posted on social media and was the first time he spoke publicly since May 2021, when he warned Israel of a "heavy price" if it did not meet Hamas's demands over Jerusalem.Here is what we know about Mohammed Deif:Mohammed Deif is the supreme military commander of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip. 
He is one of Israel's most-wanted men and has survived at least seven reported assassination attempts by the Israeli forces. He is also known as "the guest" because of his nomadic lifestyle and elusive nature.Deif was born in 1965 in Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza, when the territory was occupied by Egypt. He joined Hamas in the late 1980s and became involved in the kidnappings and killings of Israeli soldiers. He rose to prominence within the Qassam Brigades and became its leader in 2002 after the previous leader, Salah Shehade, was killed by an Israeli airstrike.Deif has been in hiding for more than two decades and is believed to be paralyzed after suffering severe injuries in multiple Israeli attacks. The most recent attempt on his life was in 2014, when an Israeli airstrike killed his wife and infant son, according to Hamas. Deif has rarely appeared or spoken in public, and his voice was last heard in May 2021, when he warned Israel of a "heavy price" if it did not meet Hamas's demands over Jerusalem.In 2009, Deif was designated a terrorist by the United States. The US State Department has described him as a "key figure in Hamas' military wing" and accused him of being responsible for "numerous terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians."Deif is considered a skilled commander and a mastermind of Hamas's military strategy, which includes the use of rockets, tunnels, drones, and suicide bombers against Israel.

'Learn from India's freedom struggle': Saudi Prince tells Palestine while attacking Hamas, Israel and the West

NEW DELHI: Prince Turki al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia referred to the "insurrection and civil disobedience" that "brought down the British Empire in India" during a recent speech on the current violence in the Middle East in which he condemned both Hamas and Israel for attacking civilians."All military occupied people have a right to resist the occupation, even militantly. I do not support the military option in Palestine. I prefer civil insurrection and civil disobedience. 
This brought down the British Empire in India and the Soviets in Eastern Europe ... I condemn actions by Hamas and by the government of Israel. In this conflict there are no heroes, only victims," said Faisal, a former senior government official of Saudi Arabia who once headed the Kingdom's intelligence unit.The elder statesman made the remarks during his address at the Baker Institute in the US earlier this week."I categorically condemn Hamas' targeting of civilians. Such targeting belies Hamas' claims to an Islamic identity," Faisal said, adding that Islam prohibits the targeting of innocent civilians, children, women and elderly even in a state of war.The attack by Hamas has given "the high moral ground to an Israeli government that is universally shunned", the Saudi prince said, adding that it has also given this Israeli government "the excuse to ethnically cleanse Gaza of its citizens and bombing them to oblivion".Faisal further said the Hamas attack has also sabotaged Saudi Arabia's attempt to move towards a peaceful resolution of the Israel-Palestine row.An insight into Saudi Arabia's positionThe Saudi leader also attacked Western nations for saying that the Hamas attack was unprovoked. "What more provocation is required to make it provoked than what Israel has done to the Palestinian people for three-quarters of a century," he asked, adding that Israeli forces have been killings Palestinians in a targeted manner, jailing civilians and stealing Palestinian lands.Prince Turki also condemned Western politicians for "shedding tears when Israelis are killed by Palestinians", but refusing to "even express sorrow when Israelis kill Palestinians".Faisal's frank speech is being widely acknowledged as the clearest indicator yet of the Saudi leadership's thinking on the situation.According to political experts, Saudi Arabia's rulers do not view Hamas in good light. In fact, many of the governments in the region share the sentiment. The rulers of Egypt, Jordan, UAE and Bahrain see Hamas and its revolutionary brand of so-called "political Islam" as a threat to their rule.Saudi Arabia was well on its way to normalising ties with Israel when Hamas launched its attack on October 7.Several analysts believe that Hamas's deadly raid into Israel was partly prompted by a desire to derail normalisation that would have left Hamas and Iran sidelined in a new Middle East.

Mia Khalifa blasted for equating military service to OnlyFans

Former adult film star Mia Khalifa has once again ignited a heated discussion on social media after reposting her year-old comments in which she asserted that being in the army is "worse than OnlyFans." Khalifa initially made these remarks during an appearance on the Ziwe talk show in July 2022, where she compared different industries involving personal exposure.In the resurfaced video shared on Veterans Day, Khalifa's controversial statement was accompanied by a clip of a military officer looking perturbed, creating a juxtaposition that fueled further debate. Comedian Marcella Arguello's reflections on the Iraq war and anti-American sentiments seemed to have triggered Khalifa's repost, leading to a flurry of responses on social media."Says the woman who is allowed to expose herself for cash based on the freedoms provided by our service members. 
You've never sacrificed a thing for anyone other than yourself. You are a sad excuse for a person," commented a person in response to Khalifa's video.The controversy surrounding Khalifa's comments has been further complicated by her outspoken support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel's actions. This has resulted in severed ties with companies like Playboy and her dismissal from a role at Red Light Holland. Khalifa's involvement in broader geopolitical discussions has brought her personal views into a larger political and social context.Social media reactions have been diverse, with some users supporting Khalifa's right to express her views and others lambasting her for the comparison between military service and OnlyFans.Khalifa has defended her stance, emphasizing the distinction between supporting Palestine and her business decisions. In response to the criticism, she expressed regret for not scrutinizing potential ties with Zionists, acknowledging the impact on her opportunities.The controversy has also extended to Khalifa's interactions with public figures. A private exchange with radio host and wrestling pundit Peter Rosenberg was made public on Khalifa's social media platform, where she has a substantial following. Rosenberg characterized Khalifa's approach to the matter as "unhinged and ridiculous."As social media continues to be a platform for such debates, the Mia Khalifa controversy underscores the challenges of navigating discussions that span personal views, freedom of expression, and broader geopolitical conflicts. The resurfacing of Khalifa's past statements has reignited conversations that reach beyond the realm of adult entertainment and delve into the complexities of individual expression in a politically charged world.

Over 150 pro-Palestinian demonstrators, advocating for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict, were reportedly arrested in Manhattan on Friday night after they blocked traffic, New York Post reported.The protest, organized by the Democratic Socialists of America, began in Bryant Park and later moved towards Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's Midtown office.A substantial number of protesters sat down in uniformed lines on Fifth Avenue, despite orders from the NYPD to disperse or face summonses for disorderly conduct. According to New York Post ,chanting "Ceasefire now!"
 and "Shame on you," the demonstrators were eventually removed by the police and taken away in buses. The exact number of detainees was not provided by the NYPD, and it remains unclear whether they were formally arrested or issued summonses.This demonstration is part of a series of protests related to the Israel-Hamas conflict in New York City since the start of the hostilities on October 7. Both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian movements have been active in the city during this period.The conflict has resulted in a significant loss of life and casualties. Over 1,400 Israelis have been reported dead, with more than 4,200 wounded and at least 100 taken hostage. The death toll is expected to rise due to thousands of rockets fired by Hamas and militant incursions into Israeli towns.In Gaza, health officials have reported at least 3,000 Palestinian deaths and more than 12,500 injuries.

Americans are split over Israel's action against Hamas, Biden's approval dips further: Poll

NEW DELHI: Americans are divided on whether Israel's response to Hamas' October 7 attack has been excessive or appropriate, with a majority of Democrats now expressing the view that it has been too much, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.The outcomes were driven by individuals of colour and younger respondents, who were significantly more inclined to assert that Israel's actions have exceeded appropriate limits. Moreover, they expressed a greater degree of sympathy towards the Palestinians as opposed to the Israelis.Distinct divisions exist on the question of whether to allocate funds for both the Israel and Ukraine conflicts, neither, or only one. Additionally, opinions differ on whether the US should assume a leadership role globally.Once again, younger Americans and individuals of nonwhite ethnicities, along with majorities of independents and Republicans, advocate for a greater focus on addressing domestic issues rather than taking on a leadership role on the world stage.The poll highlights a split among Americans regarding Israel's military actions, with 38 per cent stating that the Israeli response has been excessive, while an equal number believe it has been "about right." 
The percentage of individuals who feel the response has gone too far has increased by 12 points compared to a month ago.56% of Democrats, according to polls, now think that Israel's response has been excessive, marking a significant 21-point increase from last month.On the other hand, a majority of Republicans (52%) believe the response has been appropriate, reflecting an 8-point increase from the previous month. This shift is largely attributed to many Republicans transitioning from initially considering the response as "too little" in the aftermath of the Hamas attack to now deeming it "about right."Nonwhites were 15 points more inclined to state that the response has been excessive (48% compared to 33% for whites). Additionally, individuals under 45 were 17 points more likely than those over 45 to express the opinion that the response had been excessive."Democratic men (59%), Biden voters (59%) and people who live in big cities (53%) were most likely to say the response has been too much," according to the poll.Respondents expressed a preference for Israelis over Palestinians by a margin of 61% to 30%. However, this sentiment is largely driven by Republicans (79%) and independents (67%) who overwhelmingly favour Israel.In contrast, Democrats are divided, with 45% expressing sympathy for Israelis and an equal 45% for Palestinians.Regarding the Israel-Hamas war, 55% of respondents disapprove of Biden's handling, which is 3 points worse than last month. Among Democrats, Biden has a 60% approval for his handling of the war, down 17 points from last month.However, his approval is at a low 33% among independents and 39% among those under 45.

Egypt-Gaza border reopens for first time since Hamas attack

NEW DELHI: On Saturday, the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza was reopened, allowing a limited amount of aid to enter the besieged Palestinian territory. This marks the first time it has opened since Israel sealed it off following the violent attacks involving Hamas two weeks ago, as per the Associated Press report.Only a mere 20 trucks were granted entry, a quantity that aid workers deem inadequate to alleviate the severe humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. Over 200 trucks, loaded with approximately 3,000 tons of aid, have remained stationed near the crossing for several days.Within Gaza, 2.3 million Palestinians, half of whom have been displaced from their homes, are now forced to ration their food and resort to drinking contaminated water. 
Hospitals report dwindling supplies, including essential medical equipment and fuel for emergency generators, as the territory grapples with a widespread power outage. Israel continues to launch successive rounds of airstrikes, causing significant destruction in entire neighborhoods, while Palestinian militants respond with rocket barrages aimed at Israel.The reopening of the border followed over a week of intensive diplomatic efforts involving various mediators, including visits to the region by US President Joe Biden and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Israel's condition for allowing aid into Gaza was the release of all captives held by Hamas.Cindy McCain, the head of the UN's World Food Program, described the situation in Gaza as catastrophic to AP. She emphasized the urgent need for a more substantial number of trucks and a continuous flow of aid. Before the conflict, around 400 trucks were entering Gaza on a daily basis to provide humanitarian assistance.Gaza's Hamas-administered government has expressed that the limited convoy is insufficient to alleviate the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe and has called for a continuous, secure corridor.An Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, hassaid that they believe the humanitarian situation in Gaza is under control. He mentioned that the aid would be directed solely to southern Gaza, where the army has instructed people to relocate, and indicated that no fuel would be permitted to enter the territory.At a summit in Cairo, Guterres expressed the growing international concern regarding the well-being of civilians in Gaza. He said that while condemning Hamas' "reprehensible assault" on Israel two weeks ago, it should not be used to justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.The border opening occurred shortly after Hamas released an American woman and her teenage daughter, marking the first captives to be freed following the militant group's incursion into Israel on October 7. It remains unclear if there was any direct connection between the border opening and the captives' release. Meanwhile, Israel has reported that at least 210 captives are still being held by Hamas.Hamas has said it's working with Egypt, Qatar, and other intermediaries in an effort to resolve the hostage situation, pending security circumstances.

NEW DELHI: Thousands of Gaza residents forcibly entered UNRWA's warehouses and distribution centers, where they seized essential items like flour and other survival provisions, according to the organization. UNRWA also noted that the "civil order" in the region is beginning to deteriorate."This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege on Gaza," the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said in a statement, as per Reuters.In Deir al-Balah, there is a warehouse where UNRWA stores humanitarian supplies received from convoys coming into Gaza from Egypt. 
These aid shipments intended for Gaza have been inaccessible since Israel initiated its bombardment of the Gaza Strip in response to an attack by the militant group Hamas on October 7."Supplies on the market are running out while the humanitarian aid coming into the Gaza Strip on trucks from Egypt is insufficient," UNRWA said.UNRWA reported that the existing system for facilitating humanitarian convoys into Gaza is designed to fail. The organization also noted that its ability to provide assistance in Gaza has been hampered by air strikes, resulting in the loss of more than 50 of its staff and limitations on the movement of supplies.UNRWA's services, including schools, primary healthcare, and humanitarian aid, are delivered in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. The Israel-Hamas War began on October 7, 2023, after a surprise attack by the militant group, resulting in casualties and hostage situations. Israel has since imposed a "complete siege" on Gaza.(via Media inputs) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israeli president Isaac Herzog on Tuesday refuted Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie's allegations that the war-torn nation has committed war crimes against Palestine. “I totally reject her claims. I think she’s never been in Gaza … to visit and see the facts on the ground," Herzog told Sky News in an interview.Jolie had recently expressed her opinion about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, on her social media accounts. 
"What happened in Israel is an act of terror. But that cannot justify the innocent lives lost in bombing a civilian population in Gaza that has nowhere to go, no access to food or water, no possibility of evacuation, and not even the basic human right to cross a border to seek refuge," the actress wrote in a post on Instagram.In another post, she wrote, "Gaza was fast becoming a mass grave due to Israel's indiscriminate airstrikes and the world watches as millions of Palestine civilians ... are being collectively punished".Responding to Jolie's claims, the Israeli president said, "In Gaza there is war, but there is no humanitarian crisis that does not enable them to survive"."Angelina Jolie does not offer the Israeli people any ability to defend themselves by saying what she’s saying. And Gaza is a jail not because of Israel. Israel pulled out of Gaza. Gaza is an Iranian base filled with terror," he added.It is worth noting that Angelina Jolie also serves as a special envoy to the UN High Commission for Refugees.Meanwhile, the Israel-Hamas war entered into the second month on November 7. In the conflict, which has been described as the deadliest in decades, over 10,000 people have lost their lives in Palestine, most of them are children and women.At least 1,400 Israelis have been killed in the war, the majority among them being civilians.

NEW DELHI: Two student groups that organized protests on the Israel-Hamas war were suspended in Columbia university on Friday. According to the prestigious US university, this decision was taken because the protests 'included threatening rhetoric and intimidation.'According to , Columbia University's chair of the special committee on campus safety, Gerald Rosberg said that the Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace would be suspended throughout the fall.In a statement Rosberg said,"This decision was made after the two groups repeatedly violated University policies related to holding campus events, culminating in an unauthorized event Thursday afternoon that proceeded despite warnings and included threatening rhetoric and intimidation.He further added that the suspension would only be lifted if the two groups showed the will to comply with campus regulation.Describing the current scenario as 'charged time', Rosberg said that this action will ensure safety of the community and that core activities can be conducted without disruption in the campus.According to media reports, hundreds of Columbia students had walked out of lectures on Thursday to attend a protest organized by the two groups. It is reported that during the protests the students called on Washington to push for a ceasefire in Israel's assault on the Palestinian group Hamas.The Israeli operation to destroy Hamas has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry.According to media reports students at the Thursday protest called for the school to label Israel's assault on Gaza a 'genocide,' and demanded the university to boycott and divest frm israeli institutions.It is notable that the Middle East conflict has brought an ideological divide between the students in the American campuses. 
Earlier groups including Israeli universities and US Republicans have accused many US campuses of becoming hotbeds of anti-Semitism.Earlier Harvard, Stanford and New York University also witnessed bitter clashes involving students, professors and administrators. these clashes have blown up into viral debates on social media and charges of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and threats to free speech For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Mia Khalifa posts Amy Schumer's heated exchange with Asia Jackson over Israel-Palestine conflict

In the wake of the recent conflict between Hamas and Israel, celebrities have taken to social media to express their opinions on the matter, leading to some of them facing backlash for their comments. Notably, former adult film star Mia Khalifa and comedian Amy Schumer have found themselves at the center of a social media storm due to their controversial remarks regarding the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, reported Newsweek.The conflict escalated on October 7 when Hamas initiated a militant attack on Israel. In response, Israel launched airstrikes on Gaza and later commenced ground operations. As of November 2, the Associated Press reported at least 1,400 casualties in Israel, according to the Israeli military, while authorities in Gaza claimed that 8,800 individuals had lost their lives.Amy Schumer, who was raised Jewish, has been an outspoken supporter of Israel, whereas Lebanese-American Mia Khalifa has been a staunch advocate for the Palestinian cause. 
However, it is Khalifa's alleged praise of Hamas that has led to calls for her "cancellation," rather than her support for Gaza's civilian population.Khalifa recently lost her podcasting contract with Playboy after referring to Hamas as "freedom fighters" on social media. On the other hand, Amy Schumer faced backlash for accusing several news outlets of blaming Israel for the Gaza hospital bombing on October 17 without proper fact-checking, although later reports indicated that the missile was indeed fired from within Gaza towards Israel.On November 1, Mia Khalifa shared a post on X, a platform previously known as Twitter. The post originally came from Black and Indigenous Filipino actress Asia Jackson, featuring screenshots of an Instagram message exchange between her and Schumer. Schumer appears to have initiated contact with Jackson after she had commented, "It's so crazy to me how Bella & Gigi had to tiptoe around their statements and then Amy Schumer is like 'Gazans are rapists' and will still have a career."In response to Jackson's comment, Schumer asked, "Did something I posted about my people being massacred upset you?" Jackson replied, "The Islamophobia and generalization of Gazan people did." Schumer continued, "People all over the world are in the streets yelling for the murder of my people," and accused Jackson of being uneducated about the history of the Jewish people and the conflict, expressing her belief that Jackson was antisemitic.Schumer further inquired if Jackson had any Jewish friends, highlighting their fears for their children and lives in the context of the ongoing conflict, and accused Jackson of posting the screenshots on X to advance her career. Jackson defended herself, stating, "Very curious to hear how you know that I'm not educated about the conflict? How do you know that? You literally just followed me, you don't know who I am."In response to Schumer's comments, X users criticized her, with one user named Meech expressing their astonishment at Schumer's remarks to a "BLACK AND INDIGENOUS FILIPINA." Another user, samah fadil, commented that Schumer seemed like the type of person who had engaged in racially insensitive behavior, which garnered significant attention online.The message exchange quickly went viral, prompting Khalifa to silently weigh in by reposting comments from other users and sharing posts from public figures supporting Palestinians, including Angelina Jolie and author Dan Kovalik. While Khalifa refrained from posting her own thoughts on social media after losing her contract with Playboy, she continued to engage with content supportive of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.On November 1, Amy Schumer took to Instagram to address the backlash against her. In her post, she emphasized her desire for the safety of both Jewish and Muslim communities and pushed back against accusations of Islamophobia or supporting genocide. Schumer also addressed personal attacks on her appearance and career, asserting her status as the "most successful female comedian of all time."She concluded by acknowledging the pain that the ongoing conflict has caused and expressed her love for all people, despite the divisive rhetoric surrounding the Israel-Palestine issue.

After aid to Gaza, PM Modi calls for early resolution of conflict

In another sign of India's evolving position on the Israel-Hamas conflict, PM Narendra Modi called for concerted efforts for the 'early resolution of the security and humanitarian situation' in a conversation with Jordan's King Abdullah II, the third West Asian leader he has spoken to since the October 7 terror attack by Hamas on Israel and the subsequent retaliatory bombing of Gaza.Modi's assertion after the talks, in which he also emphasized India's concerns over terrorism, is significant, as it's the closest India has come to calling for a ceasefire. This statement came a day after India dispatched aid for civilians in Gaza. Last week, the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called for 'humanitarian pauses' in the conflict, but the EU on Monday indicated it might support such a pause to facilitate the distribution of aid in Gaza.Jordan, which signed a peace deal with Israel in 1994, is an important stakeholder in the Israel-Palestine conflict because it shares a border with the West Bank, and Palestinians make up a significant portion of its population. 
Jordan is also the official custodian of the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, a perennial flashpoint in the conflict.While Modi called for an early resolution, a Jordanian statement said that the two leaders discussed means to stop the deteriorating situation in Gaza. They also covered the need to step up international efforts to end the 'war on Gaza, protect civilians and hospitals, and guarantee the sustained delivery of medical and relief aid into the strip.'King Abdullah, who called off a summit with President Joe Biden last week after Israel was accused of bombing a hospital in Gaza, also warned of the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the repercussions of what is happening in the Gaza strip on the region and the world.In his remarks on X, formerly Twitter, Modi said he had exchanged views on the developments in the West Asia region. 'We share concerns regarding terrorism, violence, and loss of civilian lives. Concerted efforts are needed for the early resolution of the security and humanitarian situation,' he said.India's first reaction to the conflict, in the form of remarks by Modi again on X, had the government condemning the Hamas assault as terrorist strikes. Modi reiterated the same in his conversation with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and also raised concerns over terrorism in his talks with Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas. As concerns grew over the relentless bombing of Gaza by Israel, India balanced its position by expressing concerns over civilian casualties, seeking adherence to international humanitarian law, and reiterating its longstanding support for a two-state solution.

This Christmas, Eurasia, SE Asia hot picks for tourists wary of wars, visa delays

KOLKATA: The Israel-Palestine conflict in West Asia; visa issues in the US, Canada and some Schengen countries like Germany, Italy and France; and holidays to the West becoming more expensive due to the currency exchange rates has led to emergence of Eurasian and East European destinations alongside evergreen tourist spots in South-East Asia.Travel trade industry officials said Georgia, Armenia and Kazakhstan were hot picks for travel this winter with value-for-money packages that were easy on the pocket."These three countries, along with a few others in the neighbourhood, have emerged as economical Europe with seven-10 day holiday packages costing Rs 1.5-1.8 lakh per person. That is lower than a minimum of Rs 2.5-2.8 lakh per person that a holiday to any other place in Europe will cost," said Travel Agents' Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni.Easy connections to Tashkent, Almaty and Tbilisi following introduction of flights by private carrier IndiGo to these cities has also helped. Return fares to these destinations range from Rs 50,000 to around Rs 1 lakh. 
Though the conflict in Israel is still confined to Palestine with sporadic involvement of Lebanon's Hezbollah, travellers are unwilling to travel to the zone, including tourist hotspots like Jordan, Turkey and Egypt fearing escalation of the crisis that could see several other countries in the neighbourhood getting involved.But it is countries in South-East Asia - Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Singapore - that have the highest takers. "With multiple connections to Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore and holiday options at various price points, demand for travel to these destinations have soared," said Travel Agents' Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi.Holiday packages in these countries range from Rs 75,000 per person to Rs 1 lakh. Return fare to Thailand is Rs 25,000 while those to Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia is around Rs 30,000.Another factor that has come into play is easy availability of visas to these countries. While Indians now no longer require a visa to travel to Thailand, one does not need a visa to visit Cambodia (an approval is needed), e-visa is issued in three-five working days for Vietnam and Malaysia.

Soon after the terrorist attacks in Israel last week, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sent an email to employees notifying them of the company's relief efforts. The company has over 2,000 employees in the region, and he said that the security teams have been working to counter threats and disinformation. Pichai has now sent another note to employees announcing $8 million to support local nonprofits that are providing relief to civilians affected in Israel and Gaza.He also extended empathy to 'fellow Jewish, Palestinian, Arab and Muslim Googlers' saying that there are "no words [that] can erase this pain." Excerpt from his note to employees:Hi Googlers,Following my email last Saturday about Hamas's horrific terrorist attack in Israel, I wanted to let you know that today we're announcing $8 million in grants to nonprofits who are providing relief to civilians affected in Israel and Gaza.First, I want to recognise the teams who have worked tirelessly to make sure our employees were accounted for and who helped evacuate visiting Googlers and provide support on the ground. 
What our 2,000+ colleagues in Israel are going through is heartbreaking as their families and friends continue to experience loss and horror, with hostages from Israel and around the world in Gaza. Googlers in Israel are still sheltering in safe rooms. Our Tel Aviv and Haifa offices have shelters and remain open to Googlers who need them. Please expect your colleagues in these offices to be focused on the safety of their families and themselves at this moment.Second, on behalf of Google leaders, I want to share my condolences and support.Our Jewish Googlers around the world are reeling from these attacks - which bring painful reminders of the worst moments in history - and are experiencing a rise in antisemitic incidents that call for increased security at synagogues and schools.Our Palestinian, Arab and Muslim Googlers are deeply affected by a concerning rise in Islamophobia, and are watching with dread as Palestinian civilians in Gaza have suffered significant loss and fear for their lives amid the escalating war and humanitarian crisis.No words can erase this pain.Yet, we can create a culture of empathy to support our fellow Googlers through the coming weeks and months. I've always been proud of how Googlers come together in moments of crisis. I want to say a special thanks to our ERG communities - especially our Arab, Jewish and Muslim Googlers - for offering guidance and support over the past week.Relief efforts and platform updatesIn his note, Pichai also listed out the humanitarian and relief efforts as well as provided updates on the content moderation on the company's platforms.He said that out of the more than $8 million committed to nonprofits, more than $1 million was raised by Google employees with company match and $1 million in donated Search Ads to nonprofits "so they can better connect with people in need and provide information to those looking to help.""Our employee giving campaign supports organisations like Magen David Adom and ERAN. In addition, in order to provide immediate relief and support for those impacted in Israel, Google.org is committing an additional $3 million for local emergency response, and psychological and emotional support for victims, children and families," the top executive noted.Meanwhile, the company's employee giving campaign also supports organisations like Palestine Red Crescent Society and UNICEF in the State of Palestine, and the company is "committing an additional $3 million to aid organisations providing support for people in Gaza."When it comes to content moderation, Pichai said that the company's platforms are continuing to tackle disinformation, hate speech, graphic content and terrorist content. It has deployed language capabilities to support emergency efforts, including universal dubbing, emergency translations, and localising Google content to help users, businesses and NGOs.

Pro-Palestinian group posts NYC map with locations, sparks fears of attacks

The head of a global advocacy organization for Jewish people is warning of a multifaceted antisemitic attack purportedly planned to take place in New York City. The warning comes amid a rise in antisemitism directly following the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).Rise in anti-semitismAfter Hamas led the deadliest Palestinian militant attack on Israel in history, Israel launched its heaviest-ever airstrikes on Gaza. According to Israeli officials, 1,200 people in Israel were killed in Hamas' attack, while more than 11,200 Palestinians have been killed as of Thursday, according to officials from the health ministry in Gaza. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country is at war and has cut off supplies of food, fuel, electricity and medicine into Gaza.Since the Hamas attack, there has been a nearly "400 percent increase in preliminary antisemitic incidents reported year over year," according to the ADL, which noted in an October 24 release that there have been at least 109 "anti-Israel rallies" since October 7 of which ADL found "explicit or strong implicit support for Hamas" and or violence against Jewish people in Israel.Map of Jewish-based institutionsOn Thursday, Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), posted a map on X, formerly Twitter, titled "Globalize the Intifada: Zone of Operations," that highlights a vast list of Jewish-based institutions across Manhattan. Included are the Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp, the New York Times, Grand Central, Port Authority, Barclays Center, NBC News, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and Blackrock."A reminder: globalizing the intifada is a call to destroy Israel and attack Jews around the world," Deutch wrote. "This is not promoting peace. This is an incitement to violence against Jews and it must be taken seriously.""Each of the sites on this map is tied to the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the settler-colonization of Palestine. They reflect a network of dispossession, policing, prisons, surveillance, counterinsurgency, war, destruction, imperialism and militarization across the globe, with the mass media complex which manufactures consent for genocide acting as tools of the oppressor. These sites are also multi-purpose assets for some of the system's most powerful perpetrators of violence. May this map serve as a call for every struggle to act in their own interest. As we do so, we uplift one another's struggles and free Palestine from the river to the sea," a NY Post report said while describing the map.The map was posted within the same time frame that pro-Palestinian protesters shut down the Bay Bridge on Thursday morning to demand a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Signs at the bridge connecting San Francisco and Oakland read: "Stop the Genocide" and "No Military Aid to Israel" while protesters chanted "ceasefire now."The group, Within Our Lifetime, which has a large following on Instagram, did not provide details about the reasons behind sharing the locations or the nature of the actions they wanted to be taken. The post was later deleted.However, New York lawmakers have condemned the map, saying that it implies violence. Intifada is an Arabic word that means rebellion or uprising.

MIT community rallies against anti-Israel chants

NEW DELHI: More than 600 alumni, faculty, and students of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have called on the university's president to take action against the spread of slogans, messages, and hateful acts that could pose a threat to the safety of Jewish and Israeli students. This plea comes in the wake of an anti-Israel protest where calls for "intifada" were heard, reported Fox News.A group of 607 individuals associated with the institution, including a graduate from 1953, penned a letter to MIT President Sally Kornbluth, expressing their "deep concern, fear, and disappointment" following the chants of "one solution, intifada revolution" and "from the [Jordan] river to the [Mediterranean] sea, Palestine will be free!" at a rally supporting the recent Hamas terrorist attacks, which claimed the lives of over 1,400 Israelis on October 7th."While we fully support the principles of free speech and the right to peaceful assembly, it is essential that we also prioritize the safety and well-being of all members of the MIT community," the letter states. The letter highlights that in addition to the use of these offensive messages, some participants at the event directed hateful language and messages towards Jewish and Israeli bystanders. 
In one instance, an individual aggressively grabbed their bicycles with the apparent intent to harm a Jewish MIT student, while making a statement suggesting that the student's ancestors did not survive the Holocaust to harm Palestinians.The signatories of the letter include individuals with advanced degrees, such as PhDs and MBAs, as well as recipients of prestigious fellowships.They explain that within the context of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the term "intifada" refers to an "armed and violent Palestinian insurrection targeting Israelis, including civilians, which has resulted in the deaths of thousands of Israelis over the past few decades."The slogan "from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!" has repeatedly been associated with calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and has been used in contexts that promote violence.The letter's signatories point out that recent events have illustrated the potential dangers associated with this slogan. They mention that during the 2023 Israel-Hamas conflict, British Home Secretary Suella Braverman proposed the criminalization of this slogan in certain contexts, recognizing the harm it can cause. Additionally, on October 11, 2023, Vienna police banned a demonstration, citing the inclusion of the phrase "from the river to the sea" in invitations, as it was seen as a violation of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, reported Fox News.An MIT campus organization, the Coalition Against Apartheid (CAA), issued a statement on October 22 in which they held the Israeli government responsible for the ongoing violence. They characterized the deadliest day in the Jewish community since the Holocaust, which occurred on October 7 in a terror attack, as a response to the Israeli government's policies.The letter from the individuals associated with MIT demanded that the university administration discontinue any affiliations with individuals and organizations responsible for these statements on MIT grounds. They emphasized the need for the dissolution of the CAA and called for appropriate disciplinary actions against its leadership. Furthermore, they urged the establishment of clear rules and regulations to address on-campus incitement to violence.Additionally, the letter requested enhanced security and oversight at events, which would include increased presence of MIT police and the implementation of physical and technological security measures.According to Fox News, MIT President Sally Kornbluth, in an October 10 statement, condemned the Hamas terror attacks, categorizing them as horrifying and unjustifiable. On October 21, following the anti-Israel protest, Kornbluth issued another statement in which she reiterated her support for free speech but expressed concern about individual targeting, harassment, and calls to violence on campus. She emphasized the need to ensure the safety of the MIT community through practical measures.One of the organizers of the letter mentioned that while Kornbluth responded to individual emails from concerned students after the protest, she had not yet responded to the letter. The organizer remains hopeful that the delay signifies that MIT leadership is preparing a thoughtful and comprehensive response. The letter initially had 550 signatures, and 57 more MIT affiliates have since joined the call to action.(via Fox News) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Gold prices may rise another Rs 3,000 per 10 gram; consumers expected to exchange old gold for new this festive season

Gold prices set to rise: The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has led to a surge in gold prices, a development that jewelers feel may prompt consumers in India to sell their gold holdings ahead of the upcoming festival season. According to an ET report, this trend will be driven by individuals wanting to take advantage of the spike in prices and purchase new gold ornaments. Gold prices in India have already risen by Rs 874 per 10 gm, reaching Rs 57,415/10 gm, following an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas on Israel over the weekend. 
Industry insiders predict that prices could rise even further by Rs 2,500-3,000 per 10 gm if the conflict escalates in West Asia.Suvankar Sen, the MD & CEO of Senco Gold & Diamonds was quoted as saying that the exchange of old gold is expected to increase by up to 15% this festive season compared to last year due to the upward movement of gold prices.He further said that the exchange of old gold accounts for 25-30% of the company's business in urban areas and 30-35% in rural areas. Sen attributed this trend to the higher gold prices and the compulsory requirement of the Hallmark Unique Identification (HUID) number, which has prompted people to prefer exchanging their old gold jewelry. Additionally, the rural markets have experienced lower liquidity, resulting in higher participation in the old gold exchange.Ajoy Chawal, CEO of Tanishq, revealed that their gold exchange business already accounts for 41% of their total business and they aim to increase it to 45% in the current financial year. This strategy helps reduce the import of gold. Similarly, Malabar Gold & Diamonds reported that their gold exchange program contributed 36% of their total sales in the previous fiscal year, and they anticipate a similar contribution in the current year.Gold prices are mostly influenced by global inflationary trends and geopolitical developments. Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities, explained that the geopolitical tension in West Asia is likely to increase pressure on risky assets such as equities globally. Consequently, it is expected that a portion of the outflow from equities will be allocated to gold.Meanwhile, Vipul Shah, Chairman of the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, stated that it is too early to assess the impact of the conflict on India's diamond trade. The situation is being closely monitored, and a definitive assessment will be made in due course. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

P20 keeps Israel-Hamas fight out of its joint declaration

NEW DELHI: The joint declaration at the 9th G20 Nations' Speakers Conference (P20) was adopted amid objections from Indonesia and a few other countries as they sought condemnation of Israel's attacks on Gaza and the human rights "violations"."Indonesia and some other countries made the demand but the joint statement had been adopted by that time. We suggested that they could put forth their views during the deliberations and the member countries shall look into them," Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, who presided over the two-day session, said at a press conference.Indonesian news agency Antara reported that the country's House of Representatives (DPR) speaker Puan Maharani had objected to the absence of the Palestinian issue in the joint statement.Responding to the joint statement adopted by speakers of parliaments from G20 member countries in New Delhi on Saturday, she pointed out that while it addressed the "war in Ukraine", it did not mention equally significant global issues such as Palestine.Maharani said that she, along with her counterparts from Turkiye, China, South Africa and Russia, had signed a joint reservation expressing hope that the Palestinian issue would be accommodated in the statement. She said the joint reservation was not aimed to dispute the Ukrainian issue. 
However, the absence of other crucial global issues, including the Palestinian one, created an imbalance in the joint statement.Birla, however, asserted that the statement was adopted with consensus.The joint statement (Point 20) states, "Concerning the war in Ukraine, while recalling the discussion in Bali, we reiterated our national positions and resolutions adopted at the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly and underscored that all states must act in a manner consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter in its entirety."Asked whether any speaker from the G20 countries had raised the issue of presence of people in India who were pursuing separatist activities abroad, Birla said India condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and no such terror group was operating from the country's soil. "All sources of terror have to be defeated with collective determination," the Lok Sabha Speaker said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

New York police arrested supporters of the pro-Palestine movement who had occupied the headquarters of News Corp, which is the media company that owns prominent outlets such as the Fox News channel, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Post, Guardian reported.Demonstrators gathered in the News Corp lobby, chanting, “Shame” and “Fox News … you can’t hide. Your lies cover up genocide.”According to the report, pro-ceasefire demonstrators were arrested for blocking the entrance to the headquarters building of BNY Mellon, a corporate investment company. The demonstrators claimed that BNY Mellon holds shares in companies involved in the supply of weapons for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).At Columbia University and New York University (NYU), students were anticipated to stage a sit-in at an unspecified bank that provides funding for NYU's Tel Aviv campus sites.Both universities have campus extensions in Israel. 
According to the Guardian, student organizers say it is built on top of former Palestinian villages.The demonstration is meant to “highlight Columbia and NYU’s roles legitimizing Israeli apartheid” and “massive financial infrastructure … used to fund real estate projects at home and settler colonial expansions abroad”, the student organization said in a press release.More protests are expected throughout the weekend in New York, Chicago and other major US cities.The latest demonstration involved around 200 people in San Francisco shutting down a portion of the Bay Bridge, demanding a ceasefire. At least 50 people were arrested as demonstrators formed a human chain between vehicles.In Washington DC on Capitol Hill, at least 90 protesters were injured during a demonstration, with organizers claiming that police violently dispersed the peaceful protest.According to Reuters/Ipsos polling, the majority of Americans, about 68%, believe that Israel should call a ceasefire and engage in negotiations. Among Democratic voters, a majority thinks Israel's response to the October 7 Hamas attack is "too much," with 56% stating that Israel's military operations in Gaza have been excessive. People of color in the US and those under the age of 45 also perceive Israel's response as disproportionate, indicating generational and racial divides in support for Israel. On the other hand, 52% of Republicans believe Israel's response is "about right," showing an increase from the previous month's poll when more Republicans thought Israel's reaction was "too little."Overall, a majority of respondents express more sympathy for Israelis than Palestinians, Guardian reported.

Tension rise in US universities amid Israel-Hamas war

NEW DELHI: Students at American universities are divided over complex issues surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict. It's not a united front advocating for a singular cause but rather dueling protests and shouting matches. According to a report in USA Today, this surge in campus activism signifies a shift from past movements, with the Israel-Hamas conflict generating unprecedented engagement among college students. 
Experts attribute this to an increasingly divisive social media environment and nuanced dynamics surrounding the issue.The intensity of these debates has left students and parents alarmed and prompted criticism of how universities handle the situation. Pro-Palestinian activists have reported harassment, while Jewish students face rising antisemitic posts on social media and protests.Debates revolve around questions of whether Hamas's actions were justified, Israel's right to self-defense, treatment of Palestinians, and the distinction between criticisms of Israel and attacks against Jews, US Today reported.According to the report, this activism is widespread, with students, alumni, and faculty joining in. The situation has led some Jewish students to seek support from their Hillel chapters, and it’s prompting institutions to grapple with the challenge of upholding free speech while maintaining campus safety.Divergent ViewsUnlike past movements such as the fight against apartheid or the Vietnam War, the Israel-Hamas debate is marked by a lack of consensus among students. A recent survey suggests that opinions among college students vary, with a majority believing Israel has a right to exist but differing on their interpretation of events. This ambiguity has led to a more contentious environment on campuses, USA Today reported.This surge in activism has implications beyond campus boundaries. Some colleges are losing donor support, with accusations of antisemitism. Campuses have become battlegrounds for not only students but also influential business leaders pressuring institutions to address the issue. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Indian people stand with Israel, PM Modi says to Netanyahu; Israel PM assures support for safety of Indians

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi again expressed solidarity with Israel saying the people of India stood firmly with the Jewish state, as his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu called to brief him about the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas war. Modi reiterated India's condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  In the phone conversation, Modi also highlighted the issue of safety and security of Indian citizens in Israel and Netanyahu assured him of full support and cooperation in that regard, according to the Indian government. 
There are 18,000 Indian nationals in Israel, including 900 students.  "I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his phone call and providing an update on the ongoing situation. People of India stand firmly with Israel in this difficult hour. India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations," said Modi on X, formerly Twitter, shortly after the conversation. On Saturday, after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, Modi had described the offensive as terrorist attacks while expressing condolences to the innocent victims and their families. In the talks with the Israeli PM on Tuesday, Modi again expressed deep condolences and sympathy for those killed and wounded as a result of the terrorist attacks in Israel and conveyed that people of India stand in solidarity with Israel in this difficult hour. The leaders also agreed to remain in close touch.India's response to the conflict in West Asia so far has been limited to Modi's tweets and a readout of his conversation with Modi. Aware of the sensitivities involved at home, the government has been careful to not publicly offer any support to Israel but, unlike China, it has also not sought an immediate ceasefire. Modi is known to share a close rapport with the Israeli PM and was hoping to host him later this year. Netanyahu was also the PM when Modi, in 2017, travelled to Israel for the first ever visit by an Indian PM to the country. Amid efforts by the Modi government for ``de-hyphenation'' of India's ties with Israel and Palestine, the India-Israel relationship was also upgraded to a strategic partnership during that visit.  Modi, however, also became the first Indian PM the very next year to visit Palestine and his government continues to maintain that India's backing of the Palestinian cause is an ``integral'' part of its foreign policy. India officially continues to support a negotiated solution resulting in a ``sovereign, independent, viable and united'' Palestine state, at peace with Israel. Looking to mobilise support for the Israel counteroffensive, which has seen its forces pound the Gaza strip with airstrikes, Netanyahu has spoken to many world leaders in the past few days. These include the leaders of France, Germany, UK, Italy and Ukraine, apart from US President Joe Biden. As Israel has said, all of them expressed ``unreserved'' support for Israel's right to defend itself. Netanyahu's assurance about the safety and security of Indian nationals is significant as a large number of Indians continue to live in Israel. According to the MEA, there are about 18,000 Indian citizens in Israel, primarily caregivers employed by Israeli elders, diamond traders, IT professionals and students. Tourism between the 2 countries has also received a boost with Air India since 2018 operating 5 flights every week between Delhi and Tel Aviv. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Surge in anti-Israel protests across US sparks fear of destabilization

In the wake of Israel's conflict with Hamas in October, a wave of protests has swept major American cities and college campuses, drawing attention to an alarming trend of anti-Israel sentiment, reported Fox News. Rather than condemning Hamas, the focus of these demonstrations has shifted to criticizing the Jewish state. Particularly troubling instances have been observed on American college campuses, including prestigious institutions like Harvard and New York University.The movement has not been confined to campuses alone; it has reached the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington, D.C., where clashes between supposed pro-Palestinian demonstrators and the police turned violent. 
Additional protests unfolded outside the State Department, featuring handmade signs with anti-Israel slogans like "Israel = Cancer of the Middle East."Experts, offering perspectives to Fox News Digital, see these protests as part of a broader issue aimed at destabilizing the country. Human rights attorney Brooke Goldstein calls for a thorough investigation into the organization of these protests, suggesting potential connections to foreign governments or terrorist organizations.Analysts attribute the complexity of these protests to the influence of left-wing academics who have long supported divisive ideologies. Christopher F. Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, notes the overlap between rhetoric targeting Jews and similar language used against "whiteness." Lisa Daftari, editor-in-chief of The Foreign Desk, highlights the intersectionality of social justice movements, linking support for left-wing ideas with the condemnation of Israel.The rise in antisemitism is seen as a result of the cross-sectionality of social justice movements, encouraging young people to demonize Israel in alignment with their support for various human rights causes. The protests are viewed as an attempt to portray Israel as a country of white privilege, despite its diverse population.The protests also raise concerns about potential connections to terrorist groups, with some experts suggesting that protesters are not pro-Palestinian but rather pro-Hamas. The ongoing geopolitical complexities are further complicated by the use of antisemitic sentiments in various movements, including Black Lives Matter (BLM) chapters expressing support for Hamas.While the protests continue, concerns grow over their potential impact on the stability of the United States. The intersections of various social justice movements, divisive academic ideologies, and geopolitical complexities contribute to a challenging landscape that experts argue needs careful examination and investigation by law enforcement officials.

The incident quickly gained attention when viral footage of him and a friend tearing down the posters circulated on social media.The posters featured images of roughly 200 people kidnapped by Hamas, the Palestinian militant organization. While Dr ElKoussa's intentions were reportedly to prevent potential conflicts and violence in his local community, his actions faced widespread criticism.The dental office where Dr ElKoussa worked, CG Smile, issued a statement expressing their disapproval of his actions and clarifying that they do not support terrorist groups, their actions, or their supporters. 
Consequently, Dr ElKoussa was removed from the staff, and all affiliations with him on the dental office's social media pages and groups were severed.Dr ElKoussa's representative and lead attorney at Muslim Legal, Hassan Shibly, told the Post, "His personal opinion was that posters from either side may potentially incite conflict and he did not want there to be any conflict escalation in his local community. And he was concerned that those posters could potentially trigger conflict - rightfully or wrongfully, he was concerned that they would trigger and escalate conflict."The dentist's actions are said to be influenced by a recent incident involving a 71-year-old landlord who fatally stabbed a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume, and injured his mother.Upon contacting the police with his concerns about the flyers, Dr ElKoussa was advised to either put up counter-posters or remove the existing ones. He chose to remove the posters, but his actions sparked outrage and even led to death threats and harassment, ironically contributing to the conflict he sought to avoid.Hassan Shibly emphasized that Dr. ElKoussa's intention was never to harm anyone, and he had acted based on an analysis he made on the spot, deeply affected by the stabbing of the 6-year-old child. Dr ElKoussa has since apologized for any harm his actions may have caused to the Jewish community and intends to seek to regain his job, claiming that he was wrongfully terminated.Dr ElKoussa's social media accounts have been taken down, and his dental practice's Yelp page has been flooded with negative reviews.

UK police to form 'ring of steel' on Armistice Day: Met chiefs cancel leave, extend overtime

The UK police are forming a 'ring of steel' on Armistice Day, which is a national day of remembrance for the fallen soldiers of the World Wars and other conflicts, to prevent any potential clashes or disruptions between the pro-Palestinian protesters and the remembrance events.Armistice Day, observed on the 11th of November each year, commemorates the armistice signed between the Allies and Germany for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front of World War I. This day, which coincides with Remembrance Sunday, holds significant ceremonial importance in the UK, as it honors the service and sacrifice of British and Commonwealth military and civilian servicemen and women in the two World Wars and later conflicts.The pro-Palestinian protesters are planning to march in London on Saturday, November 11, 2023, to express their solidarity with the people of Gaza, who have been under siege by Israel since last month. The protesters have said that they will avoid the Cenotaph in Whitehall, where the main remembrance ceremony will take place, and that they will respect the two-minute silence at 11 am.However, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, has accused the Metropolitan Police of being biased and lenient towards the pro-Palestinian protesters, and of ignoring the violence and antisemitism that she alleged were present in their previous marches. She also criticised the police for allowing the pro-Palestinian march to go ahead on the same day as the remembrance events.In response to the controversy, the Metropolitan Police chief, Sir Mark Rowley, has said that he has no legal power to ban the pro-Palestinian protest, but that he will use his powers to impose conditions to reduce disruption and the risk of violence, and to protect the remembrance events at all costs. 
He has also said that he has cancelled leave, extended overtime, and drafted in more than 1,000 officers from across Britain to reinforce his ranks and to form a 'ring of steel' around the key locations and events of national importance.He assured that the police would safeguard locations and ceremonies of national significance at any cost.The 'ring of steel' is a term that refers to the enhanced security measures and barriers that are deployed by the police to prevent or deter any attacks or disturbances in sensitive areas. The term was first used in the 1990s, when the police erected a 'ring of steel' around the City of London, the financial district, after a series of bombings by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The term has since been used to describe similar security arrangements in other occasions and places, such as the 2012 London Olympics, the 2018 Royal Wedding, and the 2021 G7 Summit.

In an extraordinary rebuke of Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, 22 Democrats joined with Republicans in a 234-188 tally vote to censure Tlaib for her rhetoric regarding the Israel-Hamas war, reported The Hill. The censure resolution, sponsored by Republican Representative Rich McCormick of Georgia, accused Tlaib of promoting false narratives about the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and calling for the destruction of the State of Israel.Tlaib had also defended her use of the controversial phrase "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free," which is widely understood as a call to eliminate the State of Israel. She claimed it was an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence.While many Democrats defended Tlaib's right to free speech, 22 of her colleagues chose to reprimand her, with some citing the need to address what they saw as dangerous disinformation and aspersions. Tlaib, who is the only Palestinian American in Congress and a member of the progressive "Squad," has long been a target of criticism for her views on the Israel-Hamas conflict.The censure is a significant step, one below expulsion from the House, and underscores the deep divisions within the Democratic Party over the Middle East conflict and issues related to free speech and criticism of foreign governments.

PM Modi condemns Gaza hospital attack as Arab countries rally behind Palestinians, US backs Israel

PM Narendra Modi expressed shock at the bombing of a Gaza hospital that left hundreds dead, saying civilian casualties in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict were a matter of serious concern and seeking action against the perpetrators. While Hamas has accused Israel of carrying out the attack, Israel has said a misfired Palestinian rocket caused the blast.The US backed Israel's claim even as Arab countries blamed and condemned Israel for the latest and potentially the most damaging flashpoint in the conflict."Deeply shocked at the tragic loss of lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, and prayers for speedy recovery of those injured," said Modi on X."Civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict are a matter of serious and continuing concern. 
Those involved should be held responsible," he added.Modi had condemned the Hamas assault on Israel on October 7, which caused the military flare-up, as terrorist strikes and reiterated the same in a phone conversation with his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, while expressing solidarity with Israel. In his remarks on the attack on the Al Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza, Modi for the first time also expressed concern over the mounting non-combatant casualties as Israel seeks retribution against Hamas.After its initial silence on the conflict, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) had sought adherence to international humanitarian law while also reiterating India's support for a sovereign and viable Palestine state. Like the US, and unlike its Arab partners, India has so far not called for an immediate ceasefire to deal with the explosive situation.Modi's condemnation of the hospital strike and civilian casualties came in the middle of an outrage in the Arab world that saw countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt and Jordan condemn Israel for the blast. It also brought to the fore their differences with the US as President Joe Biden seemed to put the blame on the Palestinians. According to an AP report, Biden, after arriving in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, said the blast appeared to have been caused "by the other team," not Israel, but that there were "a lot of people out there" who weren't sure.Earlier in the day, Jordan cancelled a planned summit with the US and Egypt following the news of the deadly hospital attack that, according to authorities in Gaza, killed 500 people. UAE also joined Russia in calling for an urgent open meeting of the UN Security Council on the Gaza hospital issue.According to Israel though, a failed rocket launch by Islamic Jihad, a group active in Gaza, was responsible for the blast at the hospital. "This ability of the Palestinians to invade 30 Jewish communities, slaughter 1400+ Israelis, kidnap more than 200, shoot 7000+ rockets at Israeli civilians and still play the victim is amazing. The 'eagerness' of some in the world to accept these lies by #HamasISIS is disappointing but not necessarily surprising," said Naor Gilon, Israel ambassador to India.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Thursday said that the first charter flight will be reaching Tel Aviv later tonight to pick up Indians and is likely to return to India tomorrow morning.The MEA in a briefing said that Operation Ajay has been launched to bring back Indians from Israel adding that it hasn't heard of any Indian casualty so far."A charter flight will reach Tel Aviv today later in the evening. It is expected to get 230 passengers onboard. 
We have all options, but the role of IAF (in evacuation) can't be ruled out," MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said."There is conflict going on and it is a matter of concern. Around 18,000 Indians are in Israel. Indians are advised to follow advisories issued by our mission," Bagchi added.The MEA said that about a dozen odd people are there in West Bank while 3-4 people are in Gaza. The number is very small. Requests for rescue have been mostly received from Israel, it added.While speaking on the unprecedented attacks by Hamas on Israel MEA said that India sees these as terrorist attacks."As far as Palestine is concerned, India has advocated the resumption of direct negotations towards establishing the sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine living within secure and recognised border side by side with Israel," he added.

DUBLIN: Tnaiste Michel Martin has warned Israel not to break international law, saying the "entire population of Gaza can't be collectively punished" because of Israel's right to self-defence in respect of Hamas.Martin said: "Israel's perspective is that Hamas hides behind the population of Gaza and has its infrastructure, but you can't bomb entire residential blocks to get at them.""I think Israel has a right to go after Hamas and deal with Hamas. The issue is how what methodology do you use, and proportionality. 
The population can't be collateral damage to the degree it is now." He called on Israel to defend itself "within the parameters of the law", saying "international humanitarian law exists for a reason.""If you keep bombing Gaza, you will generate more martyrs for the future. You will create a more hardline radicalised extreme position. Moderation has not been supported within the Palestinian community to the way it should have been over last number of years - with the result that the Palestinian Authority now is less credible within its own ranks in the West Bank and is under pressure from more radical elements," he said, calling this a "fundamental strategic failure of Israel and others". When this conflict is over, Europe has to become more influential and effective. We can't leave it to the US all the time," he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'It scares me': Hamas attack survivor on rising anti-semitism

NEW DELHI: Natalie Sanandaji, an American woman who narrowly escaped the deadly assault by Hamas militants during the Israeli music festival on October 7, has shared her harrowing experience with Fox News digital, voicing her concerns about the growing influence of social media in fueling antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiments.Sanandaji, a 28-year-old Jewish New Yorker born to Israeli and Iranian parents, emphasized the need for a deeper understanding of the situation and condemned the actions of Hamas.Growing up, Sanandaji never comprehended how the Holocaust could have happened, until she found herself in the midst of a Hamas attack, where some of her fellow festival attendees tragically did not survive. Following the attack, she was confronted with antisemitic messages circulating on social media platforms. Speaking to Fox News Digital, she said that the issue is not just the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but the actions of Hamas."People need to understand that this is not about Israel vs. 
Palestine. This is about a terrorist organization attacking the Jews and killing innocent people, killing innocent people at a music festival, killing innocent grandmas who survived the Holocaust, just to be killed by Hamas, burning babies alive," Sanandaji said.She further said that such actions by Hamas do not serve the cause of Palestinian statehood. Instead, they exacerbate tensions and lead to further violence and loss of innocent lives.Since the Hamas attack in Israel, there have been numerous demonstrations and incidents around the world. However, Sanandaji's main concern is the surge in antisemitism that has been observed. She recounted her fear, stating, "The amount of antisemitism I've seen in videos since coming back to New York, antisemitism all over Europe and the United States, that scares me more than anything."Sanandaji had traveled to Israel to attend the festival in Re'im, where a rigorous vetting process was in place for attendees. However, the night of the attack was unexpected. Initially, the festival goers believed that the sound of rocket interceptions was normal for the region. It was only when festival security shut off the music and instructed everyone to take cover that they realized the gravity of the situation.For Sanandaji and her friends, the ordeal involved running on foot through the desert while trying to escape the violence. In one critical moment, they narrowly avoided a deadly encounter by seeking shelter from a local resident who risked his life to save theirs. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

After aid to Gaza, PM Modi calls for early resolution of conflict

In another sign of India's evolving position on the Israel-Hamas conflict, PM Narendra Modi called for concerted efforts for the 'early resolution of the security and humanitarian situation' in a conversation with Jordan's King Abdullah II, the third West Asian leader he has spoken to since the October 7 terror attack by Hamas on Israel and the subsequent retaliatory bombing of Gaza.Modi's assertion after the talks, in which he also emphasized India's concerns over terrorism, is significant, as it's the closest India has come to calling for a ceasefire. This statement came a day after India dispatched aid for civilians in Gaza. Last week, the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called for 'humanitarian pauses' in the conflict, but the EU on Monday indicated it might support such a pause to facilitate the distribution of aid in Gaza.Jordan, which signed a peace deal with Israel in 1994, is an important stakeholder in the Israel-Palestine conflict because it shares a border with the West Bank, and Palestinians make up a significant portion of its population. 
Jordan is also the official custodian of the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, a perennial flashpoint in the conflict.While Modi called for an early resolution, a Jordanian statement said that the two leaders discussed means to stop the deteriorating situation in Gaza. They also covered the need to step up international efforts to end the 'war on Gaza, protect civilians and hospitals, and guarantee the sustained delivery of medical and relief aid into the strip.'King Abdullah, who called off a summit with President Joe Biden last week after Israel was accused of bombing a hospital in Gaza, also warned of the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the repercussions of what is happening in the Gaza strip on the region and the world.In his remarks on X, formerly Twitter, Modi said he had exchanged views on the developments in the West Asia region. 'We share concerns regarding terrorism, violence, and loss of civilian lives. Concerted efforts are needed for the early resolution of the security and humanitarian situation,' he said.India's first reaction to the conflict, in the form of remarks by Modi again on X, had the government condemning the Hamas assault as terrorist strikes. Modi reiterated the same in his conversation with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and also raised concerns over terrorism in his talks with Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas. As concerns grew over the relentless bombing of Gaza by Israel, India balanced its position by expressing concerns over civilian casualties, seeking adherence to international humanitarian law, and reiterating its longstanding support for a two-state solution.

Govt readies Operation Ajay for return of Indians from Israel but no call yet to end violence

In its first response to the Israel-Hamas war, the government Wednesday launched Operation Ajay to facilitate the return from Israel of Indian nationals who wish to return and set up a 24-hour control room to monitor the situation there. Foreign minister S Jaishankar said special charter flights and other arrangements were being made and that India remained fully committed to the safety and well-being of Indian citizens abroad. The first flight is expected to be operated tomorrow.There are 18,000 Indian nationals currently in Israel and PM Narendra Modi raised the issue of their safety in his phone conversation with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week. The ministry of external affairs (MEA), however, did not make any comment on the conflict, apparently because it believes what Modi has said till now on X, formerly Twitter, appropriately captures its position. 
Expressing solidarity with Israel shortly after the unprecedented Hamas rocket attacks on Israel, Modi condemned the action as terrorist strikes and reiterated India's unequivocal condemnation of terrorism.The government has so far not called for an end to the violence or offered humanitarian assistance to its victims unlike its close Gulf strategic partner UAE which, while condemning Hamas' actions, has qualified its position by calling for protection of civilians on both sides and despatching humanitarian assistance worth $ 20 million to the Palestinians.India, however, has been closely following reports of fatalities piling up on both sides amid fears that the conflict could lead to a full-blown conflagration in a region that has been its primary source of energy and home to a large Indian diaspora. Its efforts to build stronger ties with the region has also seen it embarking on new initiatives like the I2U2, which is focused on enhancing cooperation among India, Israel, UAE and the US, and also the newly launched India-Middle East Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), both of which could be called into question if the situation worsens.More than 2000 people have already perished in the war that has resulted from Hamas' actions on October 7, designed apparently to remain relevant at a time Gulf States are normalising ties with Israel. According to Mohan Kumar, former Indian ambassador to Bahrain, the conflict is unlikely to be detrimental to India's interests in the long term.``It could even reinforce and expedite cooperation among the I2U2 countries. IMEC could be affected because of its focus on infrastructure but even there the problems will not be insurmountable,'' said Kumar, adding that India has done the right thing by not taking a wishy-washy position on the issue.India's condemnation of the Hamas attack is also in consonance with its overall position on terrorism and a sense of victimhood. The MEA, however, is expected to expand on India's response to the conflict on Thursday and it will be interesting to see if it further builds on the PM's remarks or just rewords those.India is seen by many as having diluted its support to the Palestinians by forging deep defence and security ties with Israel but officially it continues to back the Palestinian cause and a sovereign, independent, viable and united state of Palestine that can live in peace with Israel. In the current circumstances though, India may wait for diplomacy to kick in before it reiterates the same.``India's position is also in line with what UAE has said and if there's any difference it's because India, unlike UAE, doesn't have to be mindful of the Arab Street. The `Indian street' is in permanent consonance with Israel,'' said Kumar. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI:  On Friday, Grand Central Terminal in New York City was shut down due to a protest by hundreds advocating for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, as confirmed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).Initially, access to the station was limited. However, as the protest grew, the MTA decided to close the terminal. The MTA announced on its website, "Grand Central Terminal is closed until further notice due to a protest," advising travelers to consider other stations and anticipate additional travel time, the Reuters reported on Friday.The demonstrators, many of whom wore black shirts with the message “Jews say cease fire now,” filled the expansive concourse of the station, voicing their demands with chants such as “no more weapons. 
No more war. Ceasefire is what we’re fighting for.” Some protesters took their message to elevated positions, climbing the ticket counters and displaying large banners with statements like “Palestinians should be FREE” and “Never again for anyone.”Additionally, banners were dropped from the terminal’s staircases, accompanied by chants of “Mourn for the dead and fight like hell for the living.”Inside the terminal, a banner prominently displayed the message, "Mourn the dead, and fight like hell for the living."Social media captured the scene, with images of demonstrators exiting the train station and assembling on 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan. Numerous participants were seen being held by the police.The protest was orchestrated by the Jewish Voice for Peace. They shared a video on Instagram that depicted officers inside the terminal guiding a lengthy procession of protesters. These individuals wore shirts emblazoned with "Cease Fire Now" and "Not In Our Name," and had their hands restrained behind them.The group emphasized the scale of the event in their post, stating, "HUNDREDS OF JEWS AND ALLIES ARE GETTING ARRESTED IN WHAT IS LIKELY THE BIGGEST MASS CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE NYC HAS SEEN IN TWO DECADES."On the same day, Israel expanded its aerial and ground offensives in the Gaza Strip. In response, Hamas, the governing Palestinian militant group in Gaza, declared its readiness to meet the Israeli actions with "full force." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen said on Saturday a Jewish organisation in New York City cancelled a reading he was due to give on Friday without explanation, a day after he said he signed an open letter condemning Israel's "indiscriminate violence" against Palestinians in Gaza.Nguyen, a Vietnamese-American professor and writer whose novel "The Sympthizer" won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, was scheduled to speak at the 92nd Street Y literary center's Christopher Lightfoot Walker Reading Series event in Manhattan at 8pm.Writing on Instagram, Nguyen said he learned at 3pm that the event had been cancelled by the 92NY. The center describes itself on its website as "a proudly Jewish organisation." 
"Their language was 'postponment,' but no reason was given, no other date was offered, and I was never asked," Nguyen wrote."So, in effect, cancellation. Some people in social media comments say they heard it was a bomb threat. I've heard no such thing from 92Y staff." A spokesperson for 92NY confirmed it postponed the event, citing Nguyen's stance on Israel as well as the October 7 attack by militants of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and continued holding of hostages, which it said "has absolutely devastated the community." Nguyen's reprsentatives did not respond to messages seeking more details. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Coimbatore: Police have booked three people for climbing an under-construction flyover in Ukkadam during a demonstration against Israel in the city two days ago.
The Ukkadam police have registered a case against MS Sabeer Ali, district secretary of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Abuthagir of Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi (MJK), and Rafiq under sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 290 (public nuisance) and 341 (wrongful restrain) of the Indian Penal Code.
“The trio climbed an under-construction flyover in Ukkadam, posing a threat to their lives and others. Hence, we booked them,” deputy commissioner of police (South) Shanmugam said.
He said many protesters held Palestine flags in their hands during the demonstration. “We did not register a case for holding the flags,” Shanmugam said.
The demonstration was jointly organised by the Coimbatore District United Jamaath, the Federation of Islamic Organisations and a few Muslim political outfits at Ukkadam on Tuesday evening, urging all nations to support Palestine and intervene immediately to save the lives of Palestinians in Gaza. They also condemned the Centre for supporting Israel.

NEW DELHI: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced backlash over Ottawa's stand on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war as some people booed him during his undisclosed mosque visit in Toronto.During Trudeau's visit to a mosque in the Etobicoke area, people were heard saying "shame" and urging a facilitator not to let Trudeau speak at the podium, reported The Toronto Sun citing Global News.    This comes days after the Liberal MPs expressed a wide array of views on the ongoing battle between Israel and Hamas, with several calling for a ceasefire.Toronto-area Liberal MP Salma Zahid, who is chair of the Canada-Palestine Parliamentary Friendship Group, said Friday that she worked with 33 MPs to send a letter to the prime minister that laid out certain demands, reported The Toronto Sun.The letter was signed by 23 backbench Liberal MPs, eight NDP MPs and both Green Party MPs. It sought Canada to join the call for an immediate ceasefire, help facilitate the opening of a humanitarian corridor and stand up for international law."International law is clear that innocent civilians and all those not taking part in the fighting must on no account be attacked and must be spared and protected," the letter read as per the news outlet.According to The Toronto Sun, Liberal MPs in Canada are joining calls by Muslim groups for Canada to push for a ceasefire in the region, while major Canadian Jewish groups have demanded Trudeau retract an earlier comment as lending credence to the claim by Hamas that Israel was responsible for an attack on a hospital in Gaza city.Justin Trudeau has been facing growing pressure to clear his stand against those responsible for the October 17 deadly Gaza hospital blast, which Palestinian officials blamed on Israeli airstrikes. 
However, Israel refuted the Palestinian claims and said the blast occurred due to a "rocket misfired by the Hamas" -- an account which was backed by US President Joe Biden.At least 4,137 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel began bombarding the Palestinian enclave, the Hamas-controlled health ministry said on Friday. The ministry said another 13,162 people have been wounded in the Israeli strikes, which have been ongoing since October 7.Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden is seeking $100 billion in new spending from Congress, with 60 billion dollars allocated for Ukraine,14 billion dollars for Israel, 10 billion dollars for humanitarian aid, 14 billion dollars for border security, and 7 billion dollars for the Indo-Pacific region.

Israel-Hamas conflict: Why Harvard University has become a poster child for America's culture war

NEW DELHI: Harvard University, one of the most prestigious and influential institutions in the world, has been embroiled in a controversy that reflects the deep divisions and tensions in American society over the Israel-Hamas conflict and the broader issues of free speech, academic freedom, and anti-Semitism.The controversy started when a coalition of Harvard student groups, calling themselves the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups, issued a statement on October 8, 2023, blaming Israel for the violence that erupted after Hamas launched a surprise cross-border attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The statement said that the students "hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence" and that "the apartheid regime is the only one to blame" for the attacks. The statement also called on the Harvard community to take action to stop the "ongoing annihilation of Palestinians".Harvard President Emeritus Lawrence Summers expressed his strong disapproval of the university's delay in distancing itself from certain remarks of students, describing it as 'sickening'. After Summers and others' criticism, Harvard's current president, Claudine Gay, issued a statement condemning the "terrorist atrocities committed by Hamas in Israel".She emphasized that the 31 student groups did not represent the university or its leadership. "Let me also state, on this matter as on others, that while our students have the right to speak for themselves, no student group - not even 30 student groups - speaks for Harvard University or its leadership. 
As the events of recent days continue to reverberate, let there be no doubt that I condemn the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas," Gay said in a statement.Despite Gay's clarification, the statement sparked a fierce backlash from some Harvard alumni, donors, faculty, and other students, who accused the signatories of being anti-Semitic, biased, ignorant, and irresponsible. Some prominent Harvard graduates, such as billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, publicly denounced the statement and threatened to withdraw their support for the university. Some firms also rescinded employment offers to students identified as being associated with the statement. A conservative nonprofit organization called Stop Antisemitism.org organized a billboard truck that drove near Harvard's campus displaying the names and photos of some of the signatories under a banner that read: "Harvard's Leading Antisemites." The organization also published names online.Some of the signatories and their groups have since distanced themselves or withdrawn their endorsements from the statement amid the intense pressure and criticism. Several said they did not read the statement before they signed it or that they did not agree with all of its contents. Some also said they received hateful messages and threats from anonymous sources. The Harvard administration has not taken any official stance on the statement or the backlash, but has reaffirmed its commitment to free expression and academic inquiry.The controversy at Harvard reflects the wider disagreement and polarization in American society about the Israel-Hamas conflict and its underlying causes and consequences. According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, there is a growing generational and partisan gap in how Americans view Israel and its policies. Younger Americans, especially Democrats, are more likely to sympathize with Palestinians than older Americans and Republicans."56% of adults under 30 say they feel favorably toward the Israeli people, compared with 78% among those ages 65 and older. And a solid majority of those ages 18 to 29 (61%) express favorable views toward the Palestinians, compared with 46% of those 50 and older," the Pew Research survey said.Republicans are more likely to sympathize with Israel and view it as a vital ally in the Middle East. They are also more likely to oppose any criticism or pressure on Israel for its actions, the survey said.The controversy at Harvard also raises questions about the role and responsibility of elite universities in fostering critical thinking, intellectual diversity, and civil discourse among their students and faculty. Some argue that universities should encourage open debate and dialogue on controversial issues and protect academic freedom from external interference or intimidation. Others argue that universities should uphold certain standards of accuracy, balance, and respect in academic discourse and condemn any expression that is hateful, inflammatory, or discriminatory.

PM Trudeau advocates empathy amidst growing anti-semitic incidents in Canada

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday highlighted a "disturbing" global and Canadian surge in anti-Semitism, citing incidents such as Molotov cocktails thrown at synagogues. He spoke about the growing issue of Islamophobia, expressing that such behavior contradicts Canadian values."This is not who we are as Canadians. This is something that is not acceptable in Canada, period ... Canadians are scared in our own streets right now," he said. 
He emphasized the importance of empathizing with the fear and pain experienced by millions of Canadians. "We must be there to understand the fear and pain that millions of Canadians are feeling."Trudeau also emphasized the considerable effort required for a two-state solution, aiming for a viable Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel. The aspiration for an independent Palestinian state in the territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war has been a longstanding goal of international peace initiatives, though progress has stalled in recent years.He also urged a temporary halt in the Israel-Hamas conflict to secure the release of Jewish hostages and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza. Trudeau emphasized the need for a significant humanitarian pause to address the dire humanitarian crisis and evacuate foreign citizens. Canada had previously called for halts in fighting to allow aid into Gaza. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed Israel assuming overall security of Gaza post-war. The death toll in Gaza, according to Hamas-run health ministry, surpassed 10,500, mainly civilians. Israel defended its intense bombardment as necessary to combat Hamas "terrorism," with the foreign minister stating it as a war of the free world against terror-financing entities supported by Iran.

Donald Trump's bold campaign promise: 'A gallon' of enemy blood for every American drop

In a recent campaign advertisement, Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has made a striking declaration, promising to retaliate heavily against any attacks on Americans. The ad, which has gained widespread attention on social media, begins with the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's subsequent response.In the video, Trump is heard saying, "History shows very plainly that evil only respects one thing: unyielding strength." He further pledges that upon his potential return to the White House, he will ensure that America's adversaries are well aware of the severe consequences they will face. 
Trump states, "If they spill one drop of American blood, we will spill a gallon of yours."The advertisement also credits Trump with the elimination of the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) terrorist group, which had previously controlled large territories in Syria and Iraq. It asserts that his approach of projecting strength maintained peace in the Middle East and kept America away from prolonged conflicts.Furthermore, the ad criticizes the current US administration under President Joe Biden for allegedly providing financial support to Iran. This support, the ad suggests, indirectly aided Hamas militants in planning their attack on Israel. Earlier, the Biden administration had issued sanctions waivers to allow South Korean banks to release $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds as part of a prisoner exchange deal. Since Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, tens of billions of dollars owed to Iran for oil and other exports have been frozen in banks globally.Iran has refuted claims of assisting the Gaza-based militant group in planning the attack on Israel. However, a Wall Street Journal report claimed that Iran had trained around 500 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters about a month before the attack.Trump initially mentioned his willingness to "spill a gallon" of enemy blood in late October at the Republican Jewish Coalition Conference, during the ongoing Israeli military campaign against Gaza. He also proposed canceling student visas for "Hamas sympathizers on college campuses," and claimed that US college campuses are being overtaken by such elements.The Israeli military campaign, launched in response to the Hamas attack, has reportedly resulted in over 11,000 Palestinian deaths in Gaza, according to the World Health Organization.During his presidency, Trump relocated the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and proposed the "deal of the century" for Middle East peace, which involved the creation of a Palestinian state within Israeli territory. These actions were celebrated by Israel but faced strong condemnation from the Muslim world. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'It scares me': Hamas attack survivor on rising anti-semitism

NEW DELHI: Natalie Sanandaji, an American woman who narrowly escaped the deadly assault by Hamas militants during the Israeli music festival on October 7, has shared her harrowing experience with Fox News digital, voicing her concerns about the growing influence of social media in fueling antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiments.Sanandaji, a 28-year-old Jewish New Yorker born to Israeli and Iranian parents, emphasized the need for a deeper understanding of the situation and condemned the actions of Hamas.Growing up, Sanandaji never comprehended how the Holocaust could have happened, until she found herself in the midst of a Hamas attack, where some of her fellow festival attendees tragically did not survive. Following the attack, she was confronted with antisemitic messages circulating on social media platforms. Speaking to Fox News Digital, she said that the issue is not just the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but the actions of Hamas."People need to understand that this is not about Israel vs. 
Palestine. This is about a terrorist organization attacking the Jews and killing innocent people, killing innocent people at a music festival, killing innocent grandmas who survived the Holocaust, just to be killed by Hamas, burning babies alive," Sanandaji said.She further said that such actions by Hamas do not serve the cause of Palestinian statehood. Instead, they exacerbate tensions and lead to further violence and loss of innocent lives.Since the Hamas attack in Israel, there have been numerous demonstrations and incidents around the world. However, Sanandaji's main concern is the surge in antisemitism that has been observed. She recounted her fear, stating, "The amount of antisemitism I've seen in videos since coming back to New York, antisemitism all over Europe and the United States, that scares me more than anything."Sanandaji had traveled to Israel to attend the festival in Re'im, where a rigorous vetting process was in place for attendees. However, the night of the attack was unexpected. Initially, the festival goers believed that the sound of rocket interceptions was normal for the region. It was only when festival security shut off the music and instructed everyone to take cover that they realized the gravity of the situation.For Sanandaji and her friends, the ordeal involved running on foot through the desert while trying to escape the violence. In one critical moment, they narrowly avoided a deadly encounter by seeking shelter from a local resident who risked his life to save theirs. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'As long as US exists ...' America's powerful message for Israel amid war with Hamas

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday said that the US will "always" back Israel amid the ongoing war with the militant group Hamas.Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv on a trip to show solidarity with Israel, help prevent the conflict from spreading and try to free hostages.Blinken while addressing a joint press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself." "But as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to. We will always be there by your side," he added.Standing beside him, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "Thank you, America, for standing with Israel, today, tomorrow and always".Blinken endorsed Netanyahu's decision to bring some of his political opponents into a wartime unity cabinet, and said the United States knew that Hamas does not represent the true aspirations of the Palestinian people.The Islamist gunmen killed 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and took about 150 hostages in their surprise onslaught Saturday. 
Israel has retaliated by raining air and artillery strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza for six days, claiming over 1,350 lives there.Israeli forces have prepared for a possible ground invasion of the Palestinian coastal territory after what has been labelled Israel's 9/11.Israel has levelled entire city blocks in Gaza and destroyed thousands of buildings, while Hamas has now fired more than 5,000 rockets at Israel, the army said.US President Joe Biden has vowed unwavering support for Israel and not called for restraint against Hamas, but Blinken hinted at the need for an eventual peace settlement -- an idea that has long met resistance from the right-wing Netanyahu."Anyone who wants peace and justice must condemn Hamas' reign of terror," Blinken said."We know Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinian people, or their legitimate aspirations to live with equal measures of security, freedom, justice, opportunity and dignity."Netanyahu voiced appreciation for US support, which includes military aid, and said that Hamas, which rules the blockaded Gaza Strip, should be treated like the Islamic State group."Just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed. And Hamas should be treated exactly the way ISIS was treated," Netanyahu said.Blinken, speaking in personal terms, said that "I come before you not only as the United States secretary of state but also as a Jew" and "a husband and father of young children"."It's impossible for me to look at the photos of families killed, such as the mother, father and three small children murdered as they sheltered in their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, and not think of my own children," he said.

Did Hamas get Iran nod to launch attack against Israel?

NEW DELHI: Rumours about the involvement of Iran in the attack on Israel are doing the rounds after a report claimed that Iran gave nod to attack on Israel, reported BBC.In a report, the Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified members of the Lebanese rebel group Hizbollah and Hamas that Israel's arch-nemesis Iran authorized the attack a week ago.Denying the statement, Iran's foreign ministry said, "The accusations linked to an Iranian role... are based on political reasons."Iran did not intervene "in the decision-making of other countries", a spokesman added, reported BBC.Contradicting the ministry's statement, Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas spokesman said that Iran, which promised to "stand by the Palestinian fighters until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem," provided the organization with direct support for the strike, reported BBC.The US claims it has "not yet" discovered proof Iran was responsible for the strikes. However, Antony Blinken, secretary of state, did observe that "there is certainly a long relationship."Haim Tomer, a former senior official with Israel's Mossad foreign intelligence organization said, "I would say that it's not too much to assume that Iran is involved."However, Tomer said that he found the claim of Iran's involvement "a little bit cumbersome"."Yes, it's true that Iran is the number one provider of equipment to Hamas," he said, "and that they were training them in Syria and even, reportedly, in Iran."He further said, "Hamas was very much tuned to the inner conflict in Israel"."Iran sustains and supports every logistic and military aspect, but I think the decision was at least 75% an independent decision by the Hamas leadership," he added.Agreeing with Tomer, Raz Zimmt, an Iran expert at Tel Aviv University said on a soicial media post, "This is a Palestinian story.""Did Hamas use Iranian aid?
 Definitely, yes. Did Iran have an interest in this action? Yes. Does Hamas need Iranian permission to operate? No," Zimmt added.For many years, Tehran has been one of the key supporters of Hamas, giving it monetary aid as well as a huge supply of weapons, including rockets.Israel has been attempting to block Iran's supply channels to Gaza for years. These routes go through Sudan, Yemen, ships in the Red Sea, and Bedouin smugglers operating in the lawless Sinai Peninsula. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Around 18,000 Indians are in Israel. Indians are advised to follow advisories issued by our mission," Bagchi added.The MEA said that about a dozen odd people are there in West Bank while 3-4 people are in Gaza. The number is very small.
