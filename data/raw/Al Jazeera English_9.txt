Biden and Qatar's emir discuss Gaza hostages, humanitarian aid

November 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
US President Joe Biden pressed on Friday for the immediate release of hostages seized by Hamas in Israel during talks with the leader of Qatar, which has relations with the Palestinian group that governs Gaza.
Biden, in San Francisco for an Asia-Pacific summit, in a telephone call with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani "discussed the urgent need for all hostages held by Hamas to be released without further delay," a White House statement said on Friday.
Biden also raised Israel's decision to let two tankers of diesel each day into the war-torn Gaza Strip, following pleas from the United States.
Biden and the emir "discussed ongoing efforts to increase the flow of urgently needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza and Israel's decision to resume fuel deliveries for life-saving aid," the White House said.
The pair discussed 'strategic relations between the two countries' and ways strengthen them, the Qatari Emiri Diwan said.
The diwan also said Sheikh Tamim held a call with Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. The two leaders discussed developments in Gaza, as well as other 'regional and international developments of common interest'.
The call with Bahrain's monarch comes as Qatar's prime minister and foreign minister travelled to Manama for meetings with the country's crown prince and other top officials.
Qatar's foreign ministry said the two sides 'stressed the need to immediately stop the war in Gaza and protect civilians'.
Biden two days earlier had told reporters that he was "mildly hopeful" of reaching a deal to free the hostages, believed to include about 10 US citizens.
Fighters from Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, on   and killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took about 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials.
  has killed more than 12,000 people, including 5,000 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.
Qatar has in recent years rejected moves by other Gulf Arab monarchies towards normalising relations with Israel.

Bilal went out to harvest his olives, an Israeli settler shot him

October 30th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Nablus, occupied West Bank – It was Saturday morning, and 40-year-old Bilal Mohammad Saleh was harvesting olives on the small plot of land he had inherited from his father in the village of al-Sawiya, 18km (11 miles) south of Nablus.
As is usual during the Palestinian olive season, most of the family was there to help. His wife and four children as well as his siblings and some other family members were there when he was shot in the chest by an Israeli settler.
"Bilal was a poor hardworking man of the earth," says his uncle Yasir Shaheen. "His whole life he struggled, ever since he was orphaned at an early age."
He was with Bilal and other relatives on Saturday morning when, he says, the Israeli army told the family they had three minutes to leave their land.
"The soldiers knew the settlers were going to attack us, and didn't stop them," he says.
Translation: His name is Bilal. His face is familiar to many passers-by in downtown Ramallah, where he used to sell sage, thyme, thyme, figs, and prickly pears. He is 40 years old and is from the village of al-Sawiya, south of Nablus. This good and simple man went out this morning to pick olives, and a settler killed him with a bullet in the chest.
Al-Sawiya and its 3,500 people are surrounded by illegal Israeli settlements that have choked off daily life. The villagers own 12,000 dunums (1,200 hectares or 2,965 acres) of land, but they are only able to build or work on 600 dunums. The rest is controlled by Israel.
"Everything needs to be reviewed by the Israeli occupation and get its approval, from picking olives in our lands to construction and other matters of life," Nihad Arar, the village council head, explains.
The settlers in the illegal settlements attack and harass the villagers "throughout the year", he says."[They] cut down our trees, burn our farms, steal our olives, and are known to assault Palestinians inside their homes and on their own property."
Everyone's favourite herb seller
Bilal was a familiar face in downtown Ramallah, where he went every day after collecting herbs and wild plants from the hills near his village.
He had dropped out of high school and became a tiler, like his brother, until he started venturing to the hills to collect wild herbs to sell.
He would sell sage, sumac, and thyme as well as figs and prickly pears when they were in season. And, of course, he would harvest olives when they were in season.
Hazem Shaheen, Bilal's brother-in-law, says settlers from Rahalim had attacked the family before while they were harvesting olives.
"They would steal our ladders and our olives, all with the protection of the Israeli army that just stands watching," he says.
"They encourage the settlers to attack us. We can barely work on our land and have to go in secrecy. Every year they attack us."
The Israeli army did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment by time of publication.
Some Israeli news reports on Monday said Bilal's attacker was an off-duty soldier and the Israeli military police had brought him in.
On Saturday morning, Hazem says, he spotted four settlers wearing religious clothing who walked up to where Bilal was picking olives with his family.
Yasir says he "told Bilal and his family to get away and come closer to us so that we could be together".

"The settlers started approaching us, screaming and cursing, and from a distance of 100 metres, one of them fired a single bullet," he says.
The bullet struck Bilal in the chest. He fell to the ground from the ladder he was on.
Hazem explains how they "left behind everything and carried him on the ladder and ran through the trees to the main street".
"We placed him in a private car and took him to Salfit Hospital, 15km (9 miles) away," Yasir says. But sadly, Bilal was pronounced dead on arrival.
Hazem says Bilal's wife and children, the youngest of whom is nine, "are horrified and have not stopped crying".
His wife, Ikhlas, is still shocked. "He just wanted to protect me and the kids. We were scared when the settlers got too close to us and he went to confront them. None of us expected them to shoot him like that."

In this relentless war, oh how I miss my students

November 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza Strip – The start of the school year is a particularly special time for me.
Normally me and my students are starting to get to know each other and build that bond of love and trust which will grow through the year.
For me, it is an almost maternal relationship, that between me and my students, and it extends beyond schoolwork.
Now, it is more than two months since the start of the school year, but I have not had the chance to get to know my new fifth-graders. I miss that aspect, the most important part of my work that I have always cared most about – finding that space in which my students can trust me without any barriers between us.
On November 6, the Ministry of Education suspended the 2023-2024 school year for the 625,000 schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip, as Israel's offensive that began on October 7 continued, unrelenting.
Of the more than 11,000 people who have been killed by the onslaught, more than 4,400 are children, with another 1,400 young souls missing under the rubble. At least 1.5 million Palestinians have been displaced, and tens of thousands are taking shelter in schools.
'Was I able to reach their hearts?'
Over time, I usually get to know the students and their personalities little by little, so six weeks was not enough time for me to familiarise myself with all 90 students in our four fifth-grade classrooms.
I remind myself that the important thing is that I love them all even though I have not yet learned all their names.
Sometimes I'd mix up their names, and they would correct me. Or I'd call them by their family names, and they would say: "No, call me by my name," which always made me laugh.
Was I able to reach their hearts? Do they love me as I love them?
They have this knack for making me laugh even when I am annoyed at their naughtiness – I cannot keep a straight face.
They know this, which is why they don't worry too much about their punishment.
I am a science teacher and the curriculum in Palestine is demanding. It requires real effort from the students to grasp the subject fully and learn what they are taught. I try to deliver my lessons with extra activities to keep things simpler, easier, lighter.
I found this batch of fifth-graders precocious and smarter than previous ones, each one has their own style and personality. I already developed the strong impression that these are young men and women, not merely 10-year-old children.
Notes
Two years ago, I began asking my students to write notes to express their thoughts and opinions about what they were learning, and about their teacher – me.
On October 5, two days before the war began, after writing a lesson summary on the blackboard, I asked the children to write their notes anonymously.
They loved the idea. I have to confess that a small part of me was worried about what the students might write about me. I gathered their papers and told them that I would read them later.
Some of the students wrote their names on their notes and some did not, but I felt I knew who some of them were from their handwriting and their funny drawings.
Salma, the sweet girl who hugs me when I enter the classroom, said: 'The curriculum is good… you explain things so clearly and your voice is lovely.'
That certainly brought a smile to my face.
Rafiq, a supersmart student, wrote: 'The best teacher and the best subject,' which I suppose is also high praise since he knows his teachers.
Another student, Hassan, wrote: 'The subject is very easy and the lessons are nice.'
Qusay and Qais, the twins, said: 'The subject is nice and the lessons are good.'
I left their little notes in the science lab where I sit during my free time. I was planning to ask the other fifth-grade classes to write some as well, but the war came and threw all our plans out the window.
I miss their morning sleepiness.
I miss their naughtiness.
I miss hearing them shout 'Miss!' when I greet them.
I want this war to stop so I can go back to getting to know them.
I miss my students.

'We're alive', then dead silence: A Gaza family trapped in Israel's war

It has been six days since Dina Alalami heard from her family in Gaza City after she received a text message from a relative informing her that they were alive.
The 33-year-old mother of two, who has been living in Qatar's capital Doha for the past five years, has no idea whether her sister, two brothers-in-law, two nephews and three other relatives are still alive or have fallen victim to Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 11,500 people in Gaza.
"On Friday [November 10], they decided to leave their house and head south because the Israeli tanks had gotten closer and were surrounding the area," Dina told Al Jazeera on Thursday.
"They took the decision because they said they wouldn't survive the night if they stayed. We called the Red Cross and asked them to help secure a safe passage for them."
But the Red Cross and Red Crescent said they were unable to help.
The family left their homes on November 10 during the   – a day after Israel announced a daily four-hour window to allow Palestinians to flee from the north to the south.
At about noon, the family left the house waving white flags. Dina's two sisters, who are married to two brothers, had left their homes on the first day of the war to stay at their in-laws' villa, also in Gaza City.
Dina was talking to her youngest sister Rulla on the phone as the group cautiously moved forward when suddenly screams pierced the air. Their other sister Lina had crumpled to the floor, blood soaking through her shirt after an Israeli tank fired at them.
Rulla dragged Lina, getting her as far as the entrance of the Bakri building on Shuhada street, and tried to administer first aid. She saw a gunshot wound to her sister's chest.

But as the Israeli tank fire continued, Rulla had no choice but to leave her and run inside. Rulla's husband Bashar Khayal was shot in his hand, and his sister Dalia was also wounded.
Behind them, Bashar and Dalia's grandmother Feryal was lying motionless on the street, killed.
Rulla told Dina exactly where they were and begged her to get in touch with the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) to save them. The building was behind al-Zaytoun pharmacy, Rulla said, by the Abbas intersection.
Dina called the ICRC. They told her they couldn't go to the area.
'Worst feeling in the world'
The next day, on Saturday, Dina got the news she had been dreading. Lina had died, her body still at the entrance of the building.
Daliahad also been killed, succumbing to her wounds.
Lina's two young boys, four-year-old Mohammad and nine-month-old Majed, were among those trapped inside the building with their father Tareq Khayal, their grandmother Dalia, their aunt Suha, Rulla, and Bashar. They had no food, water or electricity.
Their phone batteries dying, Suha was able to send Dina one last message: "We are alive".
Dina flew to Cairo, Egypt, over the weekend, where her father lives alone, and was joined by her brother who lives in Dubai.
"Just the thought of those two young boys not having water to drink or food to eat, the thought that they could die of dehydration or starvation…" her voice trails off, her breath catching.

"It's the worst feeling in the world, this helplessness," she said. "My sister got killed, and her body is still lying on the street. There's no respect for the dead, and that alone burns our hearts."
More than 11,300 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip since October 7, the majority of them women and children. The healthcare system has collapsed due to the total siege imposed on the territory by Israel, and on Wednesday, Israeli forces   in the strip, al-Shifa, following through on their previous threats despite patients and thousands of displaced people sheltering there.
Dina last visited Gaza back in the summer for Rulla's wedding to Bashar. The two had been engaged for seven years and tied the knot in August after Rulla finished her medical studies in Egypt.
"My sisters are six and seven years younger than me, so we were like best friends," Dina said.
"I wish I was with them right now. I wish we would either die or live together."

Russia says US will not be at the centre of 'new world order'

October 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Russia has criticised the United States president's assertion that Washington must be the driving force in a new 'world order', saying such an 'American-centric' vision is outdated.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that while he agrees on the need for a 'new world order', he does not believe the US should be at the helm. Any new system should be 'free from the concentration of all mechanisms of world governance in the hands of one state", he said.
Peskov was responding to a speech  US President Joe Biden delivered on Friday in which he addressed the US engagement in foreign crises from Ukraine and Taiwan to Israel.
During his remarks, Biden said the 'world order' of the past half-century was 'running out of steam' and America needed to 'unite the world' in a new order to forge peace.
'I think we have a real opportunity to unite the world in a way it hasn't been in a long time and enhance the prospect of peace, not diminish the prospect of peace,' Biden said.
Peskov responded: 'In this part we disagree because the United States, … no matter what world order they talk about, they mean an American-centric world order, that is, a world that revolves around the United States. It won't be that way anymore."
Deepening chasm
The clash of words reflects a deepening chasm between the two global superpowers, which are   over Russia's war in Ukraine and Moscow's blooming alliances with American archrivals such as   and  .
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the US has imposed wide-reaching sanctions on Kremlin-linked individuals and entities, and supplied Ukraine with tens of billions  of dollars in humanitarian, financial and military aid.
Biden in recent remarks has also frequently drawn comparisons between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hamas, the Palestinian group governing the Gaza Strip that the US has designated  a "terrorist" organisation, saying they both pose threats to neighbouring democracies.
'Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to annihilate a neighbouring democracy,' Biden said  in an Oval Office address on Thursday.

Israel says it shot down 'aerial target' near Red Sea city of Eilat

The Israeli military says it has shot down an approaching 'aerial target' outside Israeli airspace, near the Red Sea city of Eilat, as regional tensions rise amid the  .
The incident on Tuesday triggered air raid sirens in the popular tourist resort and sent residents running for shelter.
After an initial warning of a possible "hostile aircraft intrusion", the military said in a statement, its "systems identified an aerial target approaching Israeli territory".
"There was no threat or risk to civilians," it added.
The statement did not confirm the origin of the suspected drone, but local media reports suggested that it could have come from northern Yemen, which is run by the Houthis, a group backed by Iran.
"This is a concern for Israel because it is already engaged in conflict with the Iran-backed Hezbollah on its northern front," Al Jazeera's Sara Khairat said, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem.
On October 27, drones caused explosions in the Egyptian Red Sea towns of Taba and Nuweiba, near the Israeli border. Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Iran-backed Houthis launched drones and missiles "with the intention of harming Israel".
The incidents came two days after Hamas, the group running the Gaza Strip, said it launched a rocket towards Eilat. The Israeli military said the rocket landed in an open field.
Also last week, the US military said a navy warship in the northern Red Sea intercepted projectiles launched by Houthis potentially towards Israel.
Regional tensions have been on the rise after Hamas launched a surprise attack inside Israel on October 7. Since then, Hezbollah has been involved in increasingly heavy exchanges of cross-border fire with Israel. Iran denies having any role in the Hamas attack.
Meanwhile, Israel in recent days has expanded its air and ground attacks on the Gaza Strip, which has been under relentless bombardment for more than three weeks.
Officials in Gaza say more than 8,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's air attacks, while in Israel, the death toll has topped 1,400, according to Israeli authorities.

UN chief calls on Israel to open aid 'lifeline' for Gaza

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has visited the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip in a bid to get aid flowing into the besieged Palestinian enclave. However, it remains unclear when delivery of relief materials stockpiled in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula could start.
"We are actively engaging with all the parties, with Egypt, Israel, the United States … in order to have these trucks moving as soon as possible," Guterres told journalists on Friday.
The US said details of a deal to send aid through the border were still being hammered out.
Earlier, Washington said an agreement had been reached for the passage of the first 20 trucks. However, UN officials say that aid deliveries are needed at a significant scale and under sustainable conditions.
Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people have long depended on humanitarian aid. The coastal enclave has been under a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt since Hamas took control of it in 2007.
Before the current conflict between Israel and Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza, around 450 aid trucks were arriving in the enclave daily. However, it has been under Israeli bombardment, cut off from power, water and food, and the borders have been sealed since Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7.
"We are in deep and advanced negotiations with all relevant sides to ensure that an aid operation into Gaza starts as quickly as possible and with the right conditions," Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told reporters in Geneva.
The UN was encouraged by reports that the first delivery was due to start "in the next day or so", he added.
Life and death
Guterres said there was an "absolute need to have these trucks moving as soon as possible and as many as necessary", adding that "this must be a sustained effort".
"We are not looking for one convoy to come but we are looking for convoys to be authorised in a meaningful number to have enough trucks to provide support to Gaza's people," the UN chief said.
"These are not just trucks," he stated, "but a lifeline. They are the difference between life and death."
Israel's siege and bombardment of Gaza, launched in retaliation for a deadly Hamas incursion into Israel, has created a humanitarian crisis in the enclave.
Laerke said Gaza was in dire need of water, food, fuel and medical supplies.
Damaged roads
Rafah is the only crossing into Gaza for goods and people that does not border Israel.
Efforts to get aid into the enclave have been complicated by the need to agree on a mechanism to inspect the aid, and a push to evacuate foreign passport holders from Gaza.
Roads leading into Gaza are being repaired after being hit by bombardments in the past two weeks.
Al Jazeera's Hashem Zaqout, who managed to gain rare access to the Rafah crossing on Friday, said: 'Israeli raids have left large holes on the main road that will be used by conveys to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip, making it impossible for buses or aid trucks to use it, but Egyptian teams are currently paving over them so it will be functional again."
A UN official said more than 200 trucks of aid were ready to move from Sinai into Gaza.
During previous conflicts, aid had been delivered to Gaza during humanitarian pauses through the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known to Israelis as Kerem Shalom, which is controlled by Israel.
But Israel has said it will allow no aid to enter from its territory until Hamas releases captives it has been holding since its October 7 attack.
Tel Aviv has said aid can enter through Egypt as long as it does not end up in the hands of Hamas.
Egypt has said it will not accept any mass displacement of Gaza residents into Sinai, reflecting Arab fears that Palestinians could again flee or be forced from their homes en masse, as they were during the  , or 'catastrophe,' that accompanied Israel's creation in 1948.
'Israeli responsibility'
Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Friday said that one objective in the war against Gaza is to end "Israeli responsibility" for the enclave.
Gallant made the remarks during a briefing to parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee, his office said.
"Gallant detailed the objectives of the campaign including the elimination of Hamas and destruction of both its military and governing capabilities, the complete removal of Israeli responsibility from the Gaza strip, and the creation of a new security reality in the region," the statement said.

US says Somali pirates likely behind attempted tanker seizure near Yemen

November 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United States has said that a group of attackers who   an Israel-linked cargo ship over the weekend were probably Somali pirates rather than Houthi fighters from nearby Yemen.
Speaking on Monday, Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Patrick Ryder noted that the US has not ruled out a Houthi connection to the attempted hijacking by five armed men over the weekend.
"We're continuing to assess, but initial indications that these five individuals are Somali," said Ryder.
"Clearly a piracy-related incident," he added.
US Navy forces thwarted the capture of the tanker Central Park over the weekend after it was boarded by armed men, who were captured after the US warship Mason arrived on the scene.
The attempted hijacking comes at a time when Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have carried out a   on ships in the region, and the US said ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled territory in the direction of US ships shortly after the attack.
The Houthis have consolidated control over large swathes of northern Yemen and emerged as a growing force in the region after a   with the country's government and a coalition of forces from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
While fighting in Yemen has become   over the last year, the Houthis have launched several attacks on Israel amid ongoing fighting between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Missile and drone attacks   have largely failed, but the group has seized commercial ships in the Red Sea that they say have connections to Israel.
Following one such seizure earlier this month, the US said that it was considering   as a "terrorist" organisation.
The Pentagon has said that the ballistic missiles fired over the weekend were launched in the general direction of the US ships, but that they fell into the ocean about 19km (10 nautical miles) away from the vessels and did not result in any injuries.
Yemen's government in Aden placed blame on the Houthis for the attack, but the group did not acknowledge either the missile launch or the attempted vessel seizure.
The Central Park is managed by Zodiac Maritime Ltd, a London-headquartered international ship management firm, owned by Israel's Ofer family.

Analysis: Why hasn't Israel launched a ground invasion of Gaza yet?

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Nearly three weeks after the Hamas attacks in southern Israel, Israel has not yet responded with its promised ground invasion.
Initial moves after the October 7 attacks conformed to political and military logic. A national unity government was formed to demonstrate that the country is operating as one. More than 350,000 reservists were called to arms.   started immediately although to this day it is hard to discern any military justification or pattern in the pounding of Palestinian infrastructure and killing of thousands of civilians.
Despite angry demands from Israeli society, especially its radical factions, for a massive response and total annihilation of Hamas, analysts, myself included, warned that preparations for a ground war take time. Realistic calculations were that Israel would be ready in 10 to 15 days. Nothing happened.
Half a million armed men and women remain positioned all over Israel and the occupied West Bank, but the momentum of war seems to have diminished, almost stopped. What happened? Why has the Israeli war machine not advanced into the Gaza Strip?
There may be many explanations, and only the Israeli cabinet and the army General Staff know them and keep them top secret. Outsiders can only guess based on scant open sources. We scrutinise bits of seemingly unconnected information for a pattern, subtle nuances in official statements, even body language between civilian chiefs and top military officers.
Reasons for the delay could be international or domestic, could be caused by civilian or military considerations.
Map of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Israel [Al Jazeera]
The first possibility would be the quest for a peaceful solution. Israel could be holding out to give informal and poorly coordinated international initiatives a chance to at least secure the release of some or all captives, if not to negotiate and secure a ceasefire.
That line of thought has as little credibility as do the efforts of the international community. This is the most unlikely scenario. The determination to avenge the victims of October 7 seems so unwavering that even the pleas of the hostages' families for them to be freed without fighting are being disregarded. Any armed hostage rescue situation could end in heavy collateral damage and captives dying rather than being freed.
If the reasons keeping Israel from launching its wrath are military, could that be an indication that the high command, known as Matkal, fears that the current forces it has at its disposal are insufficient? No, that cannot be because it could easily raise hundreds of thousands of additional trained reservists and arm them from its warehouses.
Another obstacle could be the realisation that the brigades poised around Gaza are not trained for bloody urban warfare and especially for what would certainly be the most difficult part of such a battle: subterranean fighting in the network of Hamas tunnels. That too cannot be the reason because the General Staff would have known how (un)prepared its forces are for that task on October 7 and would not have unleashed the fast mobilisation but would have first raised those units that needed specialised training.
Ominous lull
There might be discord between Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant (centre) and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on one side and the military commanders on the other [Handout: Israeli Ministry of Defence via Anadolu Agency]
General Herzi Halevi, chief of the Israeli General Staff, and his associates must be uneasy. They have half a million soldiers getting nervous, not knowing what their task is or when and how they will roll into action.
Every sergeant in every army knows that the worst thing for military morale is uncertainty, indecision, waiting, loitering and expecting the unknown. In peacetime, grunts are made to do menial tasks just to prevent that poisonous uneasiness, but in war, it sets in and erodes fighting capabilities rapidly.
So why are the Israelis allowing their armed forces to start doubting their purpose? Everything points to discord between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Galant on one side and Halevi and his commanders on the other.
Since time immemorial, officers obeying higher orders, imperial, royal or civilian, want those to be clear, well defined, without doubts and uncertainties. When civilian authorities order the army into action, they must outline the strategic goals and the fallback options if the primary goals prove elusive. Generals want their orders in writing so that after the battle, responsibility for eventual shortcomings or failures can be honestly apportioned.
In the case of Israel, the generals certainly want the cabinet to tell them what it expects the forces to do and what the politically acceptable level of losses and casualties is. It is Matkal's job to plan for all eventualities, but it needs to be told what the policy is.
If, hypothetically, the cabinet were to say: 'We want to expel all Palestinians from Gaza, kick them into Egypt,' or 'We want to get into Shujaieya Park, into the centre of Gaza City, raise the Israeli flag there, stay for a month and withdraw into Israel,' the military command would calculate the force levels and composition of forces needed and get them ready and deployed. It would plan for various eventualities, from easy victory to bloody deadlock or unacceptable losses and defeat.
The current ominous lull might be an indication of a standoff between the civilians and the military. I am only guessing, but it would be consistent with Netanyahu's cowboy style and bully mentality to try to pressure the army into action with muddled orders, something along the lines of: 'Just move in, kick Hamas fighters as much as you can and then we will see how it develops.'
It would also be consistent with the mentality of generals who feel a responsibility to their junior officers and troops to resist acting on vague instructions that the military sees as irresponsible.
For all of the above reasons, these uncertainties probably cannot be allowed to go on much longer. Israel must either launch the big offensive soon or say it is postponed, possibly indefinitely.

UK MP Paul Bristow sacked as aide after call for Israel-Gaza ceasefire

October 31st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A British MP for the ruling Conservative Party has been sacked from his role as a ministerial aide after calling for a ceasefire in the  .
Paul Bristow, an aide to the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, had written a letter to Prime Minister   last week urging him to change his position on the conflict and back a "permanent" end to the hostilities.
The British government says it supports "  " but not a ceasefire.
In his letter, Bristow said a full ceasefire would save lives and allow humanitarian aid to "reach the people who need it the most".
In a statement on Monday, a Downing Street spokesperson said the decision to remove Bristow from his position came in response to comments deemed "not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility".
Bristow, who represents Peterborough in parliament and co-chairs the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims, expressed understanding about Sunak's decision.
"It is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about," he told the BBC.
"I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll."
Israel in recent days has expanded its air and ground attacks on the Gaza Strip, which has been under relentless bombardment since a surprise attack by Hamas, the group running the enclave, inside Israel on October 7.
Officials in Gaza say more than 8,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's air attacks, while in Israel the death toll has topped 1,400, according to Israeli authorities.

Hamas releases two American hostages from Gaza after Qatari mediation

October 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Hamas has released two American hostages from Gaza, the Palestinian group and Israel have confirmed.
Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedeen al-Qassam Brigades, released a mother and her daughter "for humanitarian reasons" after Qatari mediation efforts, its spokesman Abu Ubaida said on Friday.
"In response to Qatari efforts, (Ezzedine) al-Qassam Brigades released two American citizens (a mother and her daughter) for humanitarian reasons," Hamas said in a statement posted on Telegram.
The Israeli prime minister's office confirmed the release of the two captives.
There was no immediate comment from the United States.
The Reuters news agency reported that the two American hostages were with the International Committee of the Red Cross, citing a source familiar with the matter.
Hamas, which took   as part of a sweeping attack on southern Israel on October 7, had said earlier in the day that it was releasing the two captives in response to diplomatic efforts by Qatar. The Israeli military said earlier on Friday that it believes that the majority of the captives are still alive.
A spokesperson for Qatar's foreign ministry said the release of the US hostages came after "many days of continuous communication with all parties."
Qatar hopes dialogue will lead to the "release of all civilian hostages from every nationality," the spokesperson said.
More than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attack, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has responded with a relentless bombardment that has killed at least 4,137 people in the Gaza Strip, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Israel has also said that there will be no end to its full blockade of the enclave unless Israeli hostages are freed.
Those held include women, children, the elderly and people from other countries, which have been working for their release, along with some Israeli soldiers.

Israel's opposition leader calls on Netanyahu to resign over Hamas attack

Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down "immediately", amid Israel's indiscriminate bombardment of Gaza in response to Hamas's October 7 attack.
Lapid called for a no-confidence vote in parliament that would allow for the formation of a new government led by another prime minister.
"Netanyahu should leave immediately … We need change, Netanyahu cannot remain prime minister," Lapid said on Wednesday in an interview with an Israeli news channel.
Lapid accuses Netanyahu and the security apparatus under his leadership of an "unpardonable failure" for not preventing the October 7 attack.
"We cannot allow ourselves to carry out a long campaign under a prime minister who has lost the people's trust," he said.
Four days after Hamas's surprise   on Israel, Netanyahu and another opposition leader, Benny Gantz, announced an agreement to form an "emergency government" for the duration of the war, but Lapid refused to join.
This is the first time Lapid has called for Netanyahu to step down saying that the situation does not warrant early elections, rather the parties should opt for a national reconstruction with another prime minister from Netanyahu's Likud party.
In a statement posted to Telegram, Likud immediately rebuffed the call, saying such a proposal in a "time of war" was "shameful".
More than 11,500 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began bombarding the besieged enclave on October 7 after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 captive.
The UN Security Council passed a resolution on Wednesday calling for "urgent and extended   and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip" to allow for aid delivery and medical evacuations,'corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days' to safeguard civilians, particularly  , and asked for the unconditional release of   held in Gaza.

France's Macron urges Israel to stop bombing and killing civilians in Gaza

Israel must stop bombing Gaza and killing civilians, French President Emmanuel Macron has told British media.
There was "no justification" for the bombing, Macron told the BBC in an interview published late on Friday, adding that a ceasefire would benefit Israel.
He said France "clearly condemns" the "terrorist" actions of Hamas, but that while recognising Israel's right to protect itself, "we do urge them to stop this bombing" in Gaza.
'I hope they will,' the French president said when asked if he wanted other leaders - including in the United States and Britain - to join his calls for a ceasefire.
Washington has refused to support calls for a full ceasefire, instead backing short stops in fighting to allow humanitarian aid.
Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, which killed 1,200 people. The intense bombings and ground assaults by Israel have since killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children.
Tel Aviv has faced growing calls for restraint, but has said Hamas would take advantage of a ceasefire to bolster its positions.
In a statement responding to Macron's comments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that world leaders should be condemning Hamas, and not Israel.
"These crimes that Hamas (is) committing today in Gaza will be committed tomorrow in Paris, New York and anywhere in the world," Netanyahu said.
Macron's interview with the BBC aired a day after a   was held in Paris.
Macron said the "clear conclusion" of all governments and agencies present at that summit was "that there is no other solution than first a humanitarian pause, going to a ceasefire' in order to protect the lives of 'all civilians having nothing to do with terrorists".
"De facto – today, civilians are bombed – de facto. These babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed. So there is no reason for that and no legitimacy. So we do urge Israel to stop," he said.
The United Nations and international rights groups have warned about the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, with the global organisation saying the lives of one million children are 'hanging by a thread'.
Since the start of the war, France has   and cracked down on those taking to the streets to protest against the killing of civilians in Gaza.

Mike Johnson, a relatively lesser-known Republican from Louisiana, has   as the new speaker of the US House of Representatives, ending three weeks of political chaos.
"The people's House is back in business," Johnson declared after taking the gavel.
Johnson, 51, is a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, who backed him for the post. The new speaker has his work cut out amid infighting in his Republican party.
Here is what to know about Johnson and his recent election.
Why the speaker race was marred by chaos?
The speaker chair of the House became vacant after Kevin McCarthy   on October 3 by the hard-right section of the Republican Party after McCarthy approved a bipartisan temporary funding bill to avoid government shutdown.
The stakes were high for US lawmakers, who were unable to function in the wake of urgent issues such as the looming threat of the US government shut down as well as the Israel-Palestine conflict and the war in Ukraine.
A cohort of Republican   for the new House speaker role struggled with party infighting. Hours before Johnson's nomination, Republican whip Tom Emmer dropped his bid after Trump urged Republicans to oppose him. Besides Emmer, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise withdrew while Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan was pushed out from the race after failed attempts at securing the votes.
Despite private balloting, Johnson won 220 votes against Democrat Hakeem Jefferies, who won 209. Democrats said they are open to a compromise candidate who would allow the chamber to function. Republicans hold the majority in the House with 221 members as opposed to 212 Democrats.
Who is Mike Johnson?
Johnson was elected to the Louisiana statehouse in 2015 and ran for Congress successfully in 2016. He now represents Louisiana's fourth congressional district.
The 51-year leader is the first Louisianan to become speaker and the first southerner to serve as speaker since Republican Newt Gingrich of Georgia in the 1990s.
He describes himself as a 'Christian, a husband, a father, a life-long conservative, constitutional law attorney and a small business owner'. He has opposed abortion rights and same sex marriage.
Addressing the House after his election, Johnson promised to quickly move forward on conservative priorities, such as support for Israel and border security.
"The time for action is now," Johnson said. "I will not let you down."
Prior to being a Congressman, he was a lawyer specialising in constitutional issues and religious freedom. He successfully defended Louisiana's same sex marriage ban in 2004. Johnson has drawn on his religious beliefs throughout his work.
He is also the former chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee.
But it remains to be seen how well Johnson will fare at uniting his fractured party as the House immediately plunges into debates over government spending – or in gaining trust from Democrats who are deeply suspicious of his socially conservative record and support for Trump.
The House will have to pass a spending bill by mid-November when the current stopgap measures expire.
Is he a Trump ally?
Johnson defended and played a role in Trump's   to overturn the 2020 election results following Joe Biden's victory.
I have just called President Trump to say this: Stay strong and keep fighting, sir! The nation is depending upon your resolve. We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans' trust in the fairness of our election system.
- Rep. Mike Johnson (@RepMikeJohnson) November 7, 2020
 
He has earned the nickname "MAGA Mike" among his hard-right colleagues, a reference to Trump's campaign slogan "Make America Great Again", which continues to be associated with Trumpian ideals.
Trump also backed Johnson in the race saying: 'I think he's gonna be a fantastic speaker'.
Where does he stand on issues?
Israel-Palestine conflict: Johnson supports Israel and his first act as speaker was calling up a resolution reaffirming US commitment to Israel.
. @JoeBiden 's address to the nation tonight only confirms the urgent need for the U.S. to act in support of our great ally, Israel, as they fight against Hamas terrorists.
We must elect a Speaker so the House can take all necessary action to end Hamas forever.
- Rep. Mike Johnson (@RepMikeJohnson) October 20, 2023
Ukraine: He is against sending Ukraine aid to defend itself against Russia, receiving an "F" from advocacy group Republicans for Ukraine .
Abortion: The new speaker has defended anti-abortion rights laws in Louisiana and has worked ( PDF ) to shut down abortion clinics.
Immigration: He is in favour of tightening the asylum system and has introduced three bills  in the past aimed to do so.
LGBTQ rights: Johnson opposes same-sex marriage and introduced a bill in 2022 that would have banned schools from promoting or discussing gender identity.
Education: Johnson has advanced the policy of school prayer. He opposes teachers' unions.

Biden calls for 'pause' in Israel's war in Gaza for the first time

President Joe Biden has voiced support for a humanitarian 'pause' to Israel's war in Gaza as the United States presses to evacuate all Americans trapped in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
'I think we need a pause,' Biden said during a campaign speech on Wednesday, after being interrupted by a protester who urged for an immediate ceasefire.
When asked what a pause meant, Biden said it was 'time to get the prisoners out' – a reference to the captives held by Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, the White House later clarified.
The US president's remarks marked a shift in the position of the White House, which has previously said it would not dictate how Israel conducts its military operations.
'We're not drawing red lines for Israel,' White House spokesperson John Kirby said last week. 'We're going to continue to support them."
On Friday, the US was one of only 14 countries in the United Nations to   to a resolution in the General Assembly calling for a 'ceasefire".
The US is by far Israel's strongest ally, sending it billions of dollars in aid annually. To support Israel's ongoing military offensive, Biden has asked Congress to approve a $14.3bn military aid package to the country.
Growing pressure
The US president has faced growing pressure from rights activists, fellow world leaders, and even progressive members of his own Democratic Party to rein in Israel from its relentless attacks on Gaza, which have killed at least 8,800 people, including 3,500 children.
He is facing particularly intense backlash from Arab Americans, an important constituency in the Democratic Party, for his staunch backing of Israel in the war.
Biden's support from Arab Americans has   to 17 percent, according to a survey from the Arab American Institute (AAI) think tank.
'This is incredibly complicated for the Israelis," Biden added during his speech. "It's incredibly complicated for the Muslim world as well … I supported a two-state solution, I have from the very beginning."
US citizens leaving Gaza
Biden's latest push for a 'pause' to the fighting comes as the US administration progresses in securing the safe exit of its citizens trapped in Gaza and begins speaking about the future of a post-war Gaza.
On Wednesday, American citizens were among hundreds of foreigners to begin leaving the besieged territory via Egypt's Rafah border crossing, part of an Egypt-mediated deal to allow safe passage for the wounded and foreign nationals.
White House spokesperson Kirby said on Wednesday he was hopeful the US would get all Americans out of Gaza in the next few days.
About 400 US citizens in Gaza have told the State Department they want to leave the territory and, with family members, US officials say they are trying to help about 1,000 people get out.
Biden's shift in rhetoric also comes amid a flurry of US diplomatic moves in the region, including the confirmation of a new ambassador to Israel and an upcoming trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Jordan and Israel.
Kirby said Biden's newly confirmed ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, would soon take up his post.
He would be tasked with 'supporting US efforts to create the conditions for a humanitarian pause to address the worsening humanitarian conditions facing Palestinian civilians".
Lew, in a Senate confirmation hearing, said 'Israel's struggle for security' was his principal concern and he would 'ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself'.
Sending my congratulations to Jack Lew on his confirmation as U.S. Ambassador to Israel. I look forward to working closely with Ambassador-designate Lew at this critical time in Israel's history and the Israel-U.S. relationship. pic.twitter.com/HTMN7zCimR
- Ambassador Michael Herzog (@AmbHerzog) October 31, 2023
Blinken will be travelling to Jordan and Israel on Friday with an agenda to boost humanitarian aid delivery and reduce casualties.
'[Blinken] will reiterate US support for Israel's right to defend itself in accordance with international humanitarian law, and discuss the need to take all precautions to minimise civilian casualties, as well as our work to deliver humanitarian assistance," State Department spokespersonMatthew Miller said.

Is the trajectory of Lebanon-Israel border conflict changing?

October 31st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah have been engaged in limited clashes at their borders for weeks, and things appear to be gradually escalating as Tel Aviv continues  Gaza amid the rising human cost of the war.
Hezbollah fighters have exchanged fire with Israeli forces regularly since Israel launched its bombardment in the wake of the October 7 surprise Hamas attack that killed about 1,400 people in Israel. More than 8,500 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in non-stop Israeli bombardments, triggering protests across the world.
So, what's the latest on the border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, how are things looking for Hezbollah at home and on the ground, what's the Iran connection, and what comes next?
How big is the border fighting?
The scope of the border fighting has gradually increased over the weeks, but it has not turned into an all-out war yet.
At first, the two sides started hitting each other with artillery strikes, and Israel also brought in its drones.
In one of the earliest incidents of casualties, Reuters video journalist Issam Abdallah, 37, was killed in an Israeli attack that left several other journalists injured as well. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said on Monday  .
The exact number of casualties since then is unclear, but dozens are believed to have been killed, mostly Hezbollah members. The Israeli army has also reported several casualties, and a number of civilians have been killed.
Changing tactics?
Skirmishes between Israel and Hezbollah were mostly limited in scope and geography during the first three weeks of the border fighting, largely targeting isolated areas and military instalments close to the border.
But in the past few days, both sides have  , going beyond the 2-4km (1.2 to 2.5-mile) range from the border that they had previously observed.
Reporting from Lebanon, Al Jazeera's Ali Hashem said on Monday that Israel is now seen targeting towns some 16km (10 miles) deep inside southern Lebanon, with Hezbollah and its backed armed groups hitting targets 14km (8.7 miles) deep. He said a residential building was also hit in Israel.
The Lebanese front, what's happening?
I can confidently say we're now in the third phase of the escalation.
1- depth of hostilities on both sides of the border is extended to at least 10 kilometers.
- Ali Hashem علي هاشم (@alihashem_tv) October 30, 2023
Notably, Hezbollah has been tapping into its arsenal more. It has deployed more drones, used different types of antitank guided missiles, and just a few days ago started using surface-to-air missiles, one of which it said downed an Israeli drone.
Reporting from Rmeiche in southern Lebanon, Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr said the trajectory of the conflict is changing.
'The tactics being used by Hezbollah are evolving,' she said.
'During the first three weeks of the escalation, Hezbollah suffered a high number of casualties. Since Friday, it has only announced the deaths of two fighters. It is not clear whether this change in tactics aims to avoid heavy casualties or if it represents an escalation in the conflict.'
Will Hezbollah go all in?
Hezbollah commands a strong military wing, which is believed to be much more superior to the Lebanese army. But it does have to contend with local politics as well.
Last week, the country's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said he is doing his duty to prevent Lebanon from entering the war.
'For now, Hezbollah has managed the situation rationally and wisely, and the rules of the game have remained constrained to certain limits,' he said.
Meanwhile, Lebanon is facing an acute economic crisis that has only gotten worse with the start of the war, while its   for a year.
So, even as many Lebanese may feel for Palestinians, they also  . That is especially true as many of them have experienced the bloody war with Israel in 2006, in which more than 1,200 people were killed in Lebanon, many of them civilians. At least 165 Israelis were also killed in the war.
But senior Hezbollah officials have been sitting down with top Hamas officials in Lebanon since the start of the conflict to discuss 'all-out victory' over Israel.
The group's secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, has been teasing an expected speech on Friday with short clips online, building up expectations for what he may announce and its effect on the fighting.
Sam Heller, a Beirut-based analyst with the Century Foundation think tank, said it is likely Hezbollah will escalate its attacks on Israeli positions or more fully enter the conflict now that   into Gaza.
'Domestic opposition to a destructive war would be substantial, but at the same time, my take is that it would not be enough to entirely constrain or deter Hezbollah from acting if its intervention is of sufficient importance for itself and the broader resistance axis of which it is a key part,' Heller told Al Jazeera.
In addition to Hezbollah and its auxiliary groups in Lebanon, the axis includes political and armed groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, in addition to a host of Palestinian factions.
What's the Iran, Syria connection?
Iran is a key supporter of this resistance axis, which is fiercely opposed to Israel and its Western backers, chiefly the United States. Tehran and Moscow are the main backers of Syria President Bashar al-Assad, who has largely crushed an armed rebellion in his country.
Tehran has said it played no part in the Hamas attack, and US and Israeli officials have also found no evidence to that effect.
Iran has   if Israel continues to target civilians in Gaza, and it has been accused by the US of facilitating attacks on its interests in Iraq and Syria through proxies, something Washington has responded to with military strikes of its own.
Heller said Iran will have a role to play in how things turn out from here, but the results of its efforts in the past few decades are now felt more clearly.
'I think Iran's more significant contribution is one that took place in the years preceding this latest war in Gaza, constituting building up this regional infrastructure and architecture of the resistance axis that now seems to have successfully constrained the Israelis, and at least to some extent limited the resources and tactics that the Israelis are prepared to bring to bear in Gaza now,' he said in reference to reports that Israel has moved considerable forces to its border with Lebanon and that it is concerned about opening a second front in the war as it fights in Gaza.

The United States has carried out two more air strikes in Syria against facilities used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its aligned groups.
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the "precision strikes" targeted a training facility near the city of Albu Kamal and a safe house near the city of Mayadeen, in response to continued attacks against US forces in Syria and Iraq.
"The President has no higher priority than the safety of U.S. personnel, and he directed today's action to make clear that the United States will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests," Austin said in a statement on Sunday.
Citing an unnamed local source, the Reuters news agency said the US strikes targeted a camp run by pro-Iranian armed groups in an area west of Albu Kamal, in Deir al Zor province. The other strike was near a bridge close to the city of Mayadeen, which is near the Iraqi border and is a stronghold of pro-Iranian armed groups, it added.
The Associated Press news agency said one of the sites also included weapons storage, citing a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of a military operation.
The   is the third in   as Washington attempts to put an end to drone and rocket attacks against its forces in Syria and Iraq that began when the   started a month ago.
US and coalition troops have been attacked at least 40 times in Iraq and Syria by Iran-backed forces in recent weeks. About 56 troops have been injured in the attacks in Syria and Iraq, but all have returned to duty, according to the Pentagon.
The US has 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 more in neighbouring Iraq, which are on a mission to advise and assist local forces trying to prevent a resurgence of  , which took control of large swathes of both countries before it was eventually defeated.
The US is concerned that the Israel-Hamas conflict could spread through the Middle East and leave US troops at isolated bases exposed.
Iran and its supporters say the US shares responsibility for Israel's declared war against the Palestinian armed group Hamas, which is also backed by Iran.

Israel's evacuation order for Gaza 'death sentence' for patients, WHO says

Israel's   amounts to a 'death sentence' for vulnerable hospital patients, the World Health Organization has warned.
WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said health authorities in Gaza have advised that it is impossible to evacuate vulnerable hospital patients within 24 hours as ordered by Israel's military.
"There are severely ill people whose injuries mean their only chances of survival is being on life support, such as mechanical ventilators," Jasarevic said on Thursday.
"So moving those people is a death sentence. Asking health workers to do so is beyond cruel."
Israel's military on Thursday ordered 1.1 million Palestinains trapped in Gaza to move south within 24 hours ahead of an expected ground offensive on the enclave.
The United Nations has warned that the relocation of so many people is 'impossible' and could have devastating consequences.
The European Union's top diplomat Josep Borrell has described Israel's directive as 'utterly unrealistic'.
Hamas, which runs the Gaza Stip, has told residents to ignore Israel's order, describing it as 'fake propaganda'.
The WHO has already warned that hospitals in Gaza are at 'breaking point' and called for a humanitarian corridor to allow in health workers and facilitate the evacuation of the sick and injured.
Jasarevic said that hospitals have only a few hours of electricity each day and are being forced to rely on generators to power critical functions, with patients in intensive care units and newborns among the most vulnerable.
"Time is running out to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, if fuel, water, food and life-saving health and humanitarian supplies cannot be urgently delivered to the Gaza Strip amidst the complete blockage," he said.

Why are US Republicans pushing for aid to Israel but not Ukraine?

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
As wars continue to rage in both Ukraine and Gaza, another battle is playing out in the United States Congress: over which country should receive aid money.
In recent months, congressional Republicans have expressed   towards approving more funds for the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as his country seeks to repel a  .
But that opposition has grown since the   on October 7, with some Republicans positioning aid for Israel and Ukraine as an either-or proposition.
'Israel is facing [an] existential threat. Any funding for Ukraine should be redirected to Israel immediately,' Republican Senator Josh Hawley posted on social media  two days after the war began.
Experts say that disparate approach — with stronger Republican backing for aid   than to Ukraine — signals the growing power of the party's hard-right flank.
"Omitting aid for Ukraine is a concession to the far right of the Republican Party,' Richard F Bensel, a government studies professor at Cornell University, told Al Jazeera.
Ukraine, he added, "has neither the emotional appeal of a religious ally nor the geopolitical importance of Israel, and the differences between the two issues reflect deeper divisions within the Republican Party between secular rationalism and sectarian emotionalism'.

Trump's lingering influence
The debate over foreign aid comes amid turmoil within the Republican caucus, which struggled last month   to lead the House of Representatives.
After weeks of  , religious conservative   finally won the gavel on October 25, in an apparent victory for hardline and evangelical interests.
One of Johnson's first moves was to introduce a bill that included nearly $14.5bn in support for Israel but zero dollars for Ukraine.   the Republican-controlled House by a vote of 226 to 196, only to be shut down in the Democrat-led Senate on Tuesday.
Robert Y Shapiro, a political science professor at Columbia University, said the failed bill points to the continued sway former President Donald Trump holds over the Republican Party.
Trump is currently the   in the 2024 presidential race. During his time in office, he championed an   that saw the US withdraw from certain international agreements, in favour of a more isolationist stance.
"This [bill] is clearly a show for the Trump base of the Republican Party, which opposes anything related to Ukraine,' Shapiro said.
Trump, he explained, has lingering resentment towards  . After all, questions over whether Trump   to Ukraine led to his  .
And then there was Trump's cosy relationship with Ukraine's adversary,  , whom he praised on several occasions.

Since leaving office, Trump has remained critical of aid to Ukraine.
In campaign stops for his reelection bid, he called on Congress to cut off military assistance to the country, accusing it of paying 'millions of dollars' to the 'Biden crime family' — a reference to his Democratic rival,  .
Trump is hardly the first leader to push for more isolationism in US foreign policy: The sentiment was particularly strong after World War I, as the country tried to disentangle itself from continued tensions in Europe.
But Stephen Zunes, a professor of politics and international studies at the University of San Francisco, told Al Jazeera that isolationism is making a comeback.
"Recent years have witnessed a growing segment of the Republican Party moving away from its more overtly imperialistic and interventionist foreign policy to a more isolationist foreign policy," Zunes said.
However, the strong Christian leanings in the Republican Party allow for a more easy embrace of aid requests for Israel.
"An exception is made for Israel, in large part due to the strong influence of fundamentalist Christians who believe that the modern state of Israel is the manifestation of Biblical Israel and therefore is in God's favour,' Zunes explained.

The impact of war fatigue
Aid to Ukraine still has   among the Republican Party, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell.
He called for military assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan to be packaged together, along with greater funds for  .
'We view all of these problems as connected,' McConnell told reporters at an October 31 press conference.
But US views overall are shifting towards the war in Ukraine, with Republican voters in particular retreating from their initial support for the embattled country.
A Gallup poll  released on November 2 found that 41 percent of Americans believe their country is 'doing too much' to help Ukraine, up from 29 percent this June.
The belief is most common among Republicans, 62 percent of whom agreed with that statement.
Some experts point to the prevalence of   among the American public. The war in Ukraine has stretched on for months since its start in February 2022, arriving at a seeming  .
But the Israel-Hamas war is new. It was sparked on October 7 with a   from the Palestinian group Hamas, and it has continued over the last month with the   of the Gaza Strip.
The US public has responded with large-scale protests in favour of Israeli and Palestinian causes.   on Saturday brought thousands of people to Washington, DC, flooding Freedom Plaza.
"Part of [the issue] is that newer conflicts will get more attention than ongoing conflicts,' Zunes said. 'Another is that the Gaza War is more violent. Israel has killed more Palestinian civilians during the past month than Russia has killed Ukrainian civilians in the past 20 months.'
Zunes also noted that Israel 'plays an important role in advancing US strategic interests in the greater Middle East', making support for the country more pressing.

Political polarisation
With withering Republican support for Ukraine, Democrats have largely helmed the push to bundle aid for the two countries together.
In October, President Biden called on Congress to approve a  , which included $61.4bn for Ukraine and $14.3bn for Israel.
But as Congress approaches its November 17 deadline to pass budget legislation — or else risk a government shutdown — experts suspect Biden's funding request is  .
What's more, the 2024 presidential race is heating up, with polls showing Biden and Trump neck and neck. Foreign aid will likely be one of many flashpoints.
"We won't see a compromise between Democrats and Republicans,' Shapiro, the Columbia professor, told Al Jazeera. 'The Republicans will almost certainly ultimately come together in opposing all things Democratic in the 2024 election.'
Bensel, meanwhile, spoke to the increasing   across the political landscape. Not only does the   butt heads with the president's agenda, but it is also at odds with the   in the Senate.
"The disagreements between the administration and the House of Representatives — and between the two chambers of Congress — are clearly driven by the very serious partisan divisions in the nation at large,' Bensel said.
That political impasse is not necessarily new, he added. 'What is abnormal is the apparently irreconcilable split within the Republican Party in the House of Representatives.'

A day after Israel struck a   transporting critically wounded patients from the al-Shifa Hospital to the Rafah border crossing, the Israeli army has intensified its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, hitting schools, mosques and more hospitals.
On Saturday morning an Israeli air missile struck the al-Fakhoora school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing at least 12 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Dr Ashraf Al-Qudra, a health ministry spokesperson in Gaza, gave a higher death toll, saying that 15 people had been killed and 54 were injured in the attack on the school.
'The number [of deaths] is expected to rise,' Muhammad Abu Silmeyeh was quoted saying, according to Reuters.
Thousands of people displaced due to Israeli bombing in the Gaza Strip had taken refuge at the al-Fakhoora school.
A witness to the attack who lost family members in the bombing told Al Jazeera that four people in their family were killed or injured.
"We have nothing to do with anything related to the Hamas movement. The room only had children and women," the witness added.
The attack on the school is the third major attack on the Jabalia camp.
It came hours after a deadly strike on the Osama bin Zaid school sheltering displaced families in the al-Saftawi area north of Gaza City, killing at least 20 people, according to local media.
On Saturday morning, the entrance of the al-Nasser Children's Hospital in western Gaza City was also attacked, and several local media outlets reported civilian casualties.
The Health Ministry's spokesperson has said an estimated 2,200 people, including 1,250 children, are currently buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings in Gaza.
Generators and solar panels
Israeli forces also attacked power generators and solar panels at   in Gaza City, according to local media.
An Anadolu agency correspondent reported that the bombing resulted in a significant fire in the hospital courtyard, which was eventually controlled by civil defence teams after several hours.
That hospital attack comes a day after the Israeli army attacked the entrance to al-Shifa Hospital and areas surroundingal-Quds Hospital and the Indonesian Hospital.
According to journalist Hani Mahmoud in Khan Younis in Gaza's south, Israeli air attacks have also hit residential homes with solar panels.
"This seems to be the last nail in the coffin," he told Al Jazeera.
"What the Israel army wants people to do is to leave. The last source that's keeping them in Gaza was the tiny bit of electricity they got from the solar panels," he said.
Meanwhile, a water tank in eastern Rafah was also destroyed. "It seems to be another way of telling people, 'We are going to bomb everything that you rely on for your survival,'" he added.
Gaza-based Al-Aqsa TV reported that the public water tank was used to supply several neighbourhoods.
Separately, an Anadolu correspondent reported that the Israeli army bombed two mosques – the Ali bin Abi Talib and the Al-Istijabah mosques – in the al-Sabra neighbourhood, also in southern Gaza.
Tamer Qarmout, assistant professor in public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera that this is part of Israel's war strategy.
"There are discussions in Israeli media that the Israeli army will get into phase two of its operations in Gaza starting from next week. This means tactical land operations inside Gaza. So what Israel wants to do before that is to have all the civilians leave to the south," he said.
"So what they're [Israel's army] doing is depriving the civilians stuck in northern Gaza from any means of living. So they've hit water tanks, hit civil facilities, hospitals and even UNRWA schools where people are taking refuge. Soon, people will be left with no option but to go south," Qarmout added.
He noted that while the   to temporarily move south since the beginning of its operation on the besieged Strip, many people have stayed because of safety concerns amid the Israeli army's continuous bombardment of the entire enclave.
"People have tried to flee south but the road has been bombed. How can they feel safe if there is no humanitarian corridor to go south?" Qarmout said.
The Israeli army has said that residents of the northern Gaza Strip will be allowed to use Salah al-Din Street, the main road in Gaza, to evacuate south between 11:00 GMT and 14:00 GMT on Saturday.
But according to Qarmout, Israel has a history of breaking promises in warfare.
"What are the guarantees that Israel still won't bombard while fleeing south? There are no international guarantors like the UN to monitor and ensure that people will not be attacked," he said. "Let's say the Red Cross is given this mandate. Then people will be ensured and feel safe."

The most vulnerable patients at   – dozens of prematurely born babies in critical condition – have been evacuated to the south of the Gaza Strip.
Of the   who had been left without incubators when al-Shifa Hospital was left short of fuel and medical supplies after  , 31 have made it out.
Mohammed Zaqout, director-general of hospitals in Gaza, told journalists that "all 31 premature babies in al-Shifa Hospital… have been evacuated" along with three doctors and two nurses, and "preparations are under way" for them to enter Egypt.
Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from the Nasser hospital in southern Gaza, said the babies were on their way to southern Gaza hospitals in six ambulances provided by S ave the Children Foundation.
Israeli forces   doctors, patients and displaced people at Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital to evacuate the medical compound, forcing some to leave by gunpoint, doctors and Palestinian officials told Al Jazeera on Saturday.
A World Health Organization team that visited the hospital on Saturday reported that there were still hundreds of patients there, including many in extremely critical condition, trauma patients with severely infected wounds, and others with spinal injuries who are unable to move.
"Patients and health staff with whom they spoke were terrified for their safety and health, and pleaded for evacuation," the agency said, describing al-Shifa as a death zone.
Doctors said that four babies had died during the raid.
It is unclear where exactly the babies will be placed once they arrive at Khan Younis. The plan is to distribute them between the European and Nasser hospitals, Abu Azzoum said. The Nasser hospital, however, has a total of 12 incubators, of which only 6 are available.

US' Blinken makes unannounced visit to Iraq amid fears of regional conflict

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made a surprise visit to Iraq amid growing fears the Israel-Hamas war could escalate into a broader regional conflict.
Blinken, who is on a multi-country tour of the Middle East, held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani on Sunday as Washington seeks Baghdad's help in cracking down on attacks on US forces that it has blamed on Iran-backed groups.
Speaking to reporters after their meeting, Blinken said the talks with al-Sudani were 'productive' and his Iraqi counterpart was working with his security forces to 'take necessary action' to deal with the attacks.
'This is a matter of Iraqi sovereignty,' Blinken said. 'No country wants to have militia groups engaged in violent activity.'
'We have a shared purpose and commitment in trying to make sure that these attacks don't happen,' the top US diplomat added.
Al-Sudani, whose government has close ties with Iran but has publicly condemned attacks on US forces in his country, reiterated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza and pointed to "the urgency of containing the crisis and preventing its spread", his office said in a statement.
The US Pentagon says that rocket and drone attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria – most of which have been claimed by a group calling itself the "Islamic Resistance in Iraq" – have increased significantly since the outbreak of fighting between Israel and Hamas.
Washington has stepped up its diplomacy in the Middle East as Arab countries and armed groups in the region grow increasingly angry over the mounting death toll from Israel's war on the Palestinian armed group Hamas.
Blinken's visit, following  , came after Lebanese officials said an Israeli air raid killed four civilians, including three children, in the latest escalation in fighting along the tense Lebanon-Israel border.
The Lebanon-based armed group Hezbollah on Sunday warned that 'the enemy will pay the price' for the attacks.
Israel's military and Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran, have engaged in regular cross-border clashes since Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel, which Israeli officials say killed at least 1,430 people, mostly civilians.
On Friday, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned that a broader regional conflict could not be ruled out and 'all scenarios are open' as long as Israel continues its bombardment of Gaza, which officials in the Hamas-governed enclave say has killed at least 9,770 people.
Blinken on Sunday night arrived in Turkey where he is expected to hold talks with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan, amid warnings by the Iran-backed group Kataib Hezbollah that the diplomat's visit would be met with 'an unprecedented escalation".
Al-Sudani is on Monday expected to begin a regional tour to Iran and the Persian Gulf nations.

US President   has submitted a request to Congress for more than $105bn to provide humanitarian and military aid to Israel and Ukraine, humanitarian assistance for Gaza and for immigration enforcement on the United States border with Mexico.
The White House issued the funding request on Friday, following a   the day before in which he argued that US security is connected to the success of Ukraine and Israel.
'This budget request is critical to advancing America's national security and ensuring the safety of the American people,' National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Friday, echoing comments from Biden's speech.
The comments come as Israel continues to bombard the beseiged Gaza Strip in response to a Hamas attack in southern Israel that killed at least 1,400 people, according to Israeli officials.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health has said that 4,137 people have been killed in the  , and humanitarian conditions in Gaza have reached critical levels as medical workers plead for fuel and assistance that has yet to materialise.
The Israeli campaign has sparked protests across the Middle East region, and critics have accused the US of turning a   to violations of international law.
Biden's request also faces complex political circumstances in Washington, where Republicans in the House of Representatives   for more than two weeks to select a candidate for the vital role of House speaker.
Some in the Republican Party have also   to further US assistance to Ukraine, a dilemma Biden may hope to bypass by attaching Ukrainian aid to support for Israel and US border enforcement with Mexico, both important issues for the conservative party.
The largest part of the spending package is dedicated to Ukraine, with more than $61bn for that purpose. More than $14bn would go towards Israel, much of it for the country's air defence system known as "the  " and other weapons purchases.
More than $9bn would be set aside for humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza, and nearly $14bn would go towards US  .
"The world is watching and the American people rightly expect their leaders to come together and deliver on these priorities," said Biden's budget director, Shalanda Young, in a letter to interim House Speaker Patrick McHenry. "I urge Congress to address them as part of a comprehensive, bipartisan agreement in the weeks ahead."

Analysis: Israel's Gaza bombing campaign is proving costly, for Israel

November 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The first response by Israel to the Hamas attacks of October 7 was to send in the air force to  . The air force was given a long list of potential targets, related to the attacks or not. The logic was to show to Israelis and Palestinians alike that Israel was not down but could muster a quick, resolute and brutal response.
Israel initially released reports of the number of air strikes it was conducting, but probably realising that admitting having bombed Gaza thousands of times was bad public relations, it switched instead to reporting the number of 'targets' it was hitting. The last figure was released about a week ago claiming 12,000 targets attacked. Without the specifics of how they were hit and with what means, the number doesn't say much.
But a lot can be deduced from the total number of bombs used. This week, Palestinian officials reported that 18,000 tonnes of bombs have been dropped on Gaza. The destruction on the ground is consistent with this figure.
Almost all   belong to the United States-designed Mk80 family, which has been in service since the Vietnam War. Originally designed as conventional free-fall weapons or 'dumb bombs', they have been constantly modernised with sophisticated targeting devices that have converted them into 'smart bombs'. These bombs are made in various sizes, classified by total weight of the weapon: 120kg (265lb), 250kg (551lb), 500kg (1,102lb)and 1,000kg (2,204lb).
The Israeli air force uses three main types of fixed-wing aircraft, all US-made. The F-15 fighter jet's main role is to secure aerial superiority although some also can be used as bombers. Israel ordered 75 of the latest F-35 fighter-bombers and has received about 40 so far. These jets are probably not being used to bomb Gaza, but they patrol the skies against any threats. This week, a video was released of an F-35 shooting down a Houthi cruise missile launched at Israel from Yemen.
The workhorse of the Gaza bombing campaign is the F-16, an old and proven aeroplane. Israel built a modified version of the fighter jet to suit its tactics with a second crew member whose main task is to control precision weapons. About 100 are in service. Although each can carry 7 tonnes, for practical purposes, it can be assumed that every F-16 takes off with four bombs.
If all of the four bombs were 1,000kg versions, 4,500 flights would be required to deliver 18,000 tonnes of bombs. But not all bombs used are of the heaviest type, so the number of bombing flights over Gaza might be closer to 6,000.
The air force has about 170 F-16s of all versions. In any air force, about 20 percent of aircraft are at any time out of service for regular maintenance, upgrades or repairs. Israel is known for professional and speedy support, so about 150 F-16s probably are usable at any time. As the campaign continues, this number will start to decrease as continuous use will require additional maintenance and replacement of parts that get worn out. But that will happen gradually, and Israel will be able to keep more than 100 F-16s in flying condition at any time.
Thus F-16s apparently fly an average of 1.5 combat missions per day. Given the specifics of the battlefield with no fewer than seven Israeli airbases within a 50km to 100km (31- to 62-mile) range from Gaza, flight times are short, so pilots can sustain flying at the current rate without worrying about long-term fatigue setting in. All air forces try to have at least two, preferably three, crews per aircraft. Although exact numbers are always one of the most guarded secrets, the Israeli air force has enough active pilots and reservists with updated training to keep regular rotations.
While Israel does not need to worry about a possible shortage of soldiers for the aerial battles, it might have to consider the logistics and finances of the bombing campaign.
Six hundred tonnes of bombs per day is a considerable amount: About 30 articulated lorries are needed just to transport them. Costs are also mounting: a 1,000kg bomb costs the US air force a reported $16,000. A much smaller foreign customer like Israel would probably have to pay a higher price of $25,000 per tonne just for the dumb version without the cost of adding the sophisticated and often much more expensive targeting electronics and hardware.
That makes for a daily price tag of well over $15m just for the basic bomb. With the add-ons, it's fair to assume that the figure rises to at least $25m per day. At that rate, the bombing campaign has so far cost Israel a minimum of $750m just in bombs.
What about additional costs? The F-16 is claimed to have a 'very low' cost in flight, 'only' $8,000 per hour. Assuming a minimum of 300 flight hours per day gives a figure of $2.5m per day, or $75m so far.
Adding to the calculation all additional aerial assets needed to sustain the bombing like surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, airborne early warning, command and control, and the like, the cost of the entire aerial campaign skyrockets.
Israel has probably spent at least $2bn so far to bomb Gaza, and the figure could be even higher. This is without the cost of mobilizing and keeping under arms   and waging the ground war that Israel began last week.
All that for very dubious military value. It is obvious that at the receiving ends of Israeli bombs are predominantly civilians and civilian infrastructure. There is little reason to believe that the figure of   killed in Gaza, among which nearly 4,000 are children, includes more than a few hundred Hamas fighters.
Battles are won by men; wars are won by resources, according to an old military adage. But as the war drags on with little clarity by way of results from the Israeli perspective, Israel's leaders will also be fighting this war with a calculator in their hands.

November 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Shortly after the Hamas group took captives during their deadly assault on  , the government of Qatar contacted the White House with a request: Form a small team of advisers to help get the captives freed.
That effort, which began in the days after the captives were taken, finally bore fruit with the announcement of   mediated by Qatar and Egyptand agreed byIsrael, Hamas and the United States.
Two officials involved in the effort gave the Reuters news agency extensive details on what led to the agreement.
Here is how it unfolded:
October 7
On October 7, Hamasfired a   into southern Israel, with sirens heard as far away as Tel Aviv and Beersheba.
As the attack was unfolding later in the day, Israeli media reported armed men seized captives in Ofakim.
Palestinian Islamic Jihad said it was holding Israeli soldiers, and Hamas social media accounts showed footage appearing to show captives being taken into Gaza.
One video showed three young men in vests, shorts and flip-flops being marched through a security installation with Hebrew writing on the wall. Other videos showed female captives and Israeli soldiers being dragged from a military vehicle.
Israel responded by starting a weeks-long bombardment on the Gaza Strip.
Diplomatic responses to the October 7 attack
Qatar, a close US ally, approached the White House shortly after October 7 with sensitive information regarding the captives and the potential for their release, officials told Reuters.
The Qataris asked that a small team, or a "cell", be established to work on the issue privately with the Israelis.
The secretive effort included tense personal diplomatic engagement by US President Joe Biden, who held a number of urgent conversations with the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the weeks leading up to the deal.
Sullivan directed McGurk and another National Security Council official, Josh Geltzer, to establish the team. This was done without telling other relevant US agencies because Qatar and Israel demanded extreme secrecy with only a few people to be in the know, the officials said.
According to Reuters reports, US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk held daily morning calls with the prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani. He reported back to national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and Biden was briefed daily on the process.

October 13
Biden got an upfront look at what the victims of the Hamas attack endured when he held an emotional, lengthy meeting with the families of Americans who were either being held captive or were unaccounted for.
'They're going through agony not knowing what the status of their sons, daughters, husbands, wives, children are,' he said. 'You know, it's gut-wrenching. I assured them of my personal commitment to do everything possible, everything possible' to ensure the Americans' return.

October 18
Biden   for talks with Netanyahu. The official told Reuters that securing the release of captives was a central focus of his discussions with Netanyahu and his war cabinet, as was humanitarian assistance.
October 20
Qatari and Egyptian   leads to the release of two elderly Israeli women. Yokheved Lifshitz and Nurit Yitzhak, also known as Nurit Cooper, were released on 'humanitarian' grounds, according to Hamas.
The 85-year-old Lifshitz said at a news conference on Tuesday that she was hurt during the abduction but was treated well during captivity. Both women's husbands remain captive.
October 23
Five days later, the White House team's work helped yield the release of two American captives, Natalie Raanan, 17, and her mother, Judith, 59.
From outside his West Wing office, Sullivan, the US Middle East envoy McGurk, and Sullivan's deputy Jon Finer tracked in real time the captives' difficult, multi-hour journey out of Gaza.
They   to Egypt through the Rafah crossing with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They met with Israeli security forces in Egypt and were transferred to a military base in Israel to be reunited with their family.
The return of the two Americans proved it was possible to gain freedom for captives and gave Biden confidence that Qatar could mediate the release of more people, officials said.
Now, an intensified process started to get more captives out. CIA Director Bill Burns began speaking regularly with Mossad Director David Barnea.
We facilitated the release of 2 more hostages, transporting them out of #Gaza  this evening.
Our role as a neutral intermediary makes this work possible & we are ready to facilitate any future release.
We hope that they will soon be back with their loved ones.
- ICRC (@ICRC) October 23, 2023
October 24
Israel was poised to launch a   in Gaza, the US side got word that Hamas had agreed to the parameters of a deal to release women and children, which would mean a pause and a delay in the ground invasion.
US officials debated with the Israelis whether the ground offensive should be delayed.
The Israelis argued that terms were not firm enough to delay since there was no proof of life for the captives. Hamas claimed they could not determine who was being held until a pause in fighting began.
The US and Israeli governments viewed the Hamas position as disingenuous. An unnamed official told Reuters that Israel's invasion plan was adapted to support a pause if a deal came together.
Israel steps up its ground attack on Gaza three days later, on October 27.
October 30
According to the Israeli military, a fifth person, a soldier, Private Ori Megidish, was rescued on October 30 during a ground raid inside Gaza.
Abu Obeida said the soldier was not held  by the Qassam Brigades, and it was possible she was held by civilians or individual parties in Gaza.
'Pulling teeth'
Over the next three weeks, Biden engaged in detailed talks as proposals about a potential captive release were traded back and forth. Demands were made that Hamas produce the lists of captives it was holding, their identifying information, and guarantees of release.
The process was long and sometimes seemed to move painfully slow – communication was difficult, and messages had to be passed from Doha or Cairo into Gaza and back before being relayed to Israel and the US, according to officials.
'Every step of this is like pulling teeth,' one official said at the time, according to a report by CNN.
Biden held a previously undisclosed phone call with the Qatari prime minister when the phasing of releases began to take shape, the official told Reuters.
Under the agreement that was taking shape, women and children captives would be freed in a first phase, together with a commensurate release of Palestinian prisoners from the Israelis.
The Israelis insisted Hamas ensure all women and children come out in this phase. The US side agreed and demanded through Qatar a proof of life or identifying information for women and children held by Hamas.
Hamas said it could guarantee 50 in the first phase but refused to produce a detailed list of the captives.
November 9
CIA director Burns met in Doha with the Qatari leader and Mossad's Barnea to go through the texts of the emerging arrangement.
The key obstacle at that point was that Hamas had not clearly identified who it was holding.
Three days later, Biden called the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and demanded to know the names or clear identifying information for the 50 captives, including ages, gender and nationalities.
Without the information, the official told Reuters, there was no basis to move forward.
Shortly after Biden's call, Hamas produced details for the 50 captives it said it would release in the first phase of any deal.

November 14
According to Reuters, Biden called Netanyahu and urged him to take the deal. Netanyahu agreed.
McGurk saw Netanyahu that same day in Israel. Walking out of a meeting, Netanyahu grabbed McGurk's arm and said that 'we need this deal' and urged Biden to call the emir of Qatar on the final terms, one of the officials said.
Talks stalled as communications went dark in Gaza.
When they resumed, Biden was in San Francisco attending an Asia-Pacific summit. He called the emir of Qatar and worked with him to apply pressure on Israel and Hamas to close the deal, officials said.

US Middle East envoy McGurk met in Doha with the Qatari prime minister. CIA director Burns was dialled in after he spoke with Mossad. The meeting identified the last remaining gaps toward a deal.
The agreement was now structured for women and children to be freed in the first phase but with an expectation for future releases and the aim to bring all captives home to their families.

In Cairo, McGurk met with Egypt intelligence chief Abbas Kamel in the morning. Word came from Hamas leaders in Gaza that they had accepted nearly all the agreements worked out the day before in Doha.
Only one issue remained – the number of captives to be released in the first phase and the ultimate structure of the deal to incentivise releases beyond the 50 known women and children, the officials said.
A flurry of additional meetings ensued, and the deal finally came together.

Before the meeting to discuss the deal, Netanyahu thanked Biden for his work to include more captives and fewer concessions in the agreement.

An Israeli bombardment of southern Lebanon has killed three journalists, according to Lebanese media, as hostilities grow along Israel's northern border.
Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported on Tuesday that an 'enemy bombing' killed three people in the Tayr Harfa area, about 1.6km (1 mile) from the Israeli frontier.
Lebanese channel Al Mayadeen TV said two of its staff were among the victims. The third person killed was said to be a local journalist and 'contributor' to the channel.
'Correspondent Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih Me'mari were killed by an Israeli attack,' Al Mayadeen said in a statement.
'It was a direct attack, it was not by chance,' Al Mayadeen director Ghassan bin Jiddo said, noting it came after an Israeli government decision this month to block access to the channel's website.
"Another attack has targeted journalists in southern Lebanon, killing a reporter and a cameraman who worked for the pan-Arabic channel Al Mayadeen … A third person, who was with them, was also killed," said Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from southern Lebanon.
"The feeling here is that the Israeli army wants to silence the media and punish journalists," our correspondent said.

Israel   Al Mayadeen TV last week, accusing it of 'wartime efforts to harm [Israel's] security interests and to serve the enemy's goals'.
Israel's Minister of Communications Shlomo Karhi said on October 13 he had begun work to block Al Mayadeen's websites and programming and shut down its local offices.
"The Lebanese information minister has asked the army to open an investigation into [the attack on Tuesday]," Khodr said, adding that this was the third attack against journalists in southern Lebanon since October 13.
The Israeli military said it was "looking into the details" of the incident, the AFP news agency reported.
The latestkillings add to at least 50 reporters and media workers who have been killed  amid Israel's 46-day war in Gaza, according to press freedoms group, the Committee to Protect Journalists.
The vast majority of the killed journalists are Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Since October 7, when Israel waged its war in Gaza following Hamas's attack on Israeli territory, there have been repeated confrontations between the Israeli army and Hezbollah on the Israel-Lebanon border.
So far, the fighting has killed 70 Hezbollah fighters, 13 Lebanese civilians, seven Israeli troops and three Israeli civilians, in what is the worst escalation since 2006.

Israel's overnight air raids have killed at least 55 people and destroyed 30 homes in Gaza, authorities in the besieged enclave said, marking an escalation in Israel's air campaign in advance of an  .
The Hamas government press office said in a statement that "more than 55" people were killed in Saturday night's attacks.
The casualties add to the more than 4,300 Palestinians, mostly civilians, who have been killed in Israel's bombing campaign on Gaza, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health.
Israel has pledged to eliminate Hamas after the armed group's October 7 attacks inside the country, which Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
Israeli air raids have damaged or destroyed 40 percent of Gaza's housing, according to the United Nations, reducing much of the enclave to ruins.

However, the southern portion of Gaza has not been spared from air attacks, with nine people killed in the southern city of Khan Younis on Saturday night, according to Hamas authorities.
Israel's military has pledged to intensify air raids in the coming days to minimise risks to its troops when they move in on Gaza.
The expected ground offensive has raised fears of more civilian deaths due to the limited options for safe haven in the densely populated enclave, which has been under an Israeli blockade since 2006. More than one million people have been displaced in Gaza, according to UN estimates.
"From today, we are increasing the strikes and minimising the danger," Israeli military spokesperson Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Saturday.
"We will increase the attacks and therefore I called on Gaza City residents to continue moving south for their safety."
Israeli troops are expected to encounter numerous challenges during a ground invasion, including the presence of Hamas booby traps and tunnels. The safety of an estimated 200 captives being held by Hamas is another complicating factor.
'Gaza is densely populated, the enemy is preparing a lot of things there – but we are also preparing for them," Israeli Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi said.

UK's Conservatives lose two safe seats in historic by-election defeat

October 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's ruling Conservative Party has lost two safe parliamentary seats in a bellwether vote ahead of the next general election.
The centre-left Labour Party easily won the two central England seats up for grabs in by-elections held on Thursday, in an ominous sign for the Conservatives' prospects in national elections expected next year.
Labour's Alistair Strathern and Sarah Edwards cruised to victory in the seats of Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth, overturning Tory majorities of nearly 25,000 and 20,000, respectively.
The governing Tories had held Mid Bedfordshire since 1931, and Tamworth since 1996.
George Osborne, a former Conservative chancellor, earlier warned that the loss of Mid-Bedfordshire would mean 'Armageddon' for the centre-right party.
Labour leader Keir Starmer hailed the wins as proof of the public's desire for new leadership.
"These are phenomenal results. Winning in these Tory strongholds shows that people overwhelmingly want change and they're ready to put their faith in our changed Labour Party to deliver it," Starmer said.
Labour has enjoyed a double-digit polling lead over the Conservatives for more than a year as voters fume over high inflation, a weak economy and long waiting times to use the state-run health service.
Facing flagging support in the polls, Sunak has announced a number of major policy shifts, including scrapping part of a costly high-speed rail link and watering down measures aimed at helping the UK achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
The policy announcements have done little to improve the Tories' standing in the polls, although Sunak's personal approval has improved slightly.
Sunak was not in the UK for the by-election results after travelling to Israel to express support for the country in its war with the armed Palestinian group Hamas.

Diseases spread in Gaza amid water and sewage crisis, cholera feared

November 19th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Khan Younis, Gaza – Sewage flows in the streets of Gaza as all key   have ceased operating, raising the alarming prospect of an enormous surge of gastrointestinal and infectious diseases among the local populations – including cholera.
For Gaza's 2.3 million residents, finding drinkable water has become close to impossible.
At a school run by the United Nations relief agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in Khan Younis, 33-year-old Osama Saqr attempted to fill some bottles with water for his thirsty children.
He took a sip and grimaced in disgust at the saltiness of the fluid, before letting out a long sigh.
'It's polluted and unsuitable, but my children always drink it, there's no alternative,' he told Al Jazeera.
Saqr's one-year-old son has diarrhoea but he cannot find medicines in hospitals or pharmacies to treat him. 'Even if I find it, the problem remains, the water is polluted and salty water, not suitable for drinking,' he said.
'I'm afraid that eventually, I'm going to lose one of my children to this poisoning.'
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded more than 44,000 cases of diarrhoea and 70,000 acute respiratory infections, but real numbers may be significantly higher. On Friday, the UN agency said it was extremely concerned that rains and floods during the approaching winter season will make an already dire situation even worse.
"We are hearing about several hundred people per toilet at the UNRWA centres and those have been overflowing, so people are doing open defecation," Richard Brennan, regional emergency director for the Eastern Mediterranean region at WHO, told Al Jazeera. "They have to find a place to go to the bathroom in the grounds where they are staying. That's a huge public health risk and also very humiliating.'
Brennan said overcrowding, lack of solid waste management, poor sanitation and open-air defecation were all contributing to the spread of diseases including diarrhoea, respiratory infections and skin infections, including scabies.
UN agencies have warned that the collapse of water and sanitation services   if urgent humanitarian aid is not delivered. If nothing changes, 'there will be more and more people falling sick and the risk of major outbreaks will increase dramatically,' Brennan said.
Out of fuel
Gaza's essential water and sanitation infrastructure has either been destroyed by Israeli bombardment or has run out of fuel. In the southern governorates of Deir el-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah, all 76 water wells have stopped functioning, as well as two main drinking water plants and 15 sewage pumping stations, according to the UNRWA.
WHO estimates that the average person in Gaza is currently consuming just 3 litres of water per day for drinking and sanitation. This compares with the minimum of 7.5 litres recommended by the agency in emergency situations.
The halt of key services including water desalination plants, sewage treatment and hospitals has led to a 40 percent increase in diarrhoea for people taking shelter in UNRWA schools, the agency said. It estimated that about 70 percent of Gaza's 2.3 million people – more than half of whom are children – no longer have access to clean water.
On Wednesday, Israeli authorities allowed just over 23,000 litres (6,000 gallons) of fuel to be brought into the Strip via Egypt. But they restricted the use of this fuel to trucks transporting the little aid coming in. The UNRWA said it needed 160,000 litres (42,000 gallons) of fuel a day for basic humanitarian operations.
'This fuel cannot be used for the overall humanitarian response, including for medical and water facilities or the work of UNRWA,' the agency's Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini told a press conference. 'It is appalling that fuel continues to be used as a weapon of war. This seriously paralyses our work and the delivery of assistance to the Palestinian communities in Gaza.'
The Ministry of Health in Gaza has warned that the lack of clean water caused by fuel shortages has put the lives of 1,100 patients with kidney failure, including 38 children, particularly at risk.
Among them is Samer Abdeen's 22-year-old brother, Muhammad, who has been suffering from acute renal colic due to the poor water quality. 'When he is in great pain, he screams,' Abdeen, 40, told Al Jazeera as he searched the streets of Khan Younis for bottled water to buy.
While bottled water is now expensive and very hard to find, he refused to give up the search.
'I don't want to lose him in this unjust war,' he said.
Dying of thirst
Sixty-year-old Samir Asaad, from Deir el-Balah camp, suffers from high blood pressure, which is exacerbated by drinking salty water. 'I heat up the water over a fire to drink it so I don't feel its saltiness,' he said.
'They are killing us from thirst or forcing us to drink any water so that we die anyway,' he said, referring to the Israeli siege on Gaza.
Humanitarian officials are calling for more aid to enter Gaza. The World Food Programme warned on Thursday that supplies of food and water were almost non-existent in Gaza and that civilians were facing the immediate possibility of dehydration and starvation.
Some residents resorted to digging wells to extract water, despite it being contaminated by the sewage and solid waste piling up untreated on the streets. Asaad said his family prefers to line up for hours to fill bottles at filling stations, but they are under no illusion that the water there will be any safer to drink.
Umi al-Abadla, deputy director general of primary care at Gaza's health ministry, said water reaching the filling station used to be treated before being pumped, but this is no longer possible due to the lack of fuel.
"As a result of the power outage, water is distributed from random wells whose water is contaminated,' he said. "This has caused diarrhoea among children, more than the annual average."
He added that the lack of personal hygiene as a result of the mass displacement was causing a spread of skin diseases as well as viral diseases including chickenpox, and raising the threat of epidemics of diseases including cholera.
Drinking dirty seawater
Desperate to quench their thirst, some in Gaza have resorted to drinking seawater.
But, with sewage systems and wastewater treatment plants out of operation due to the lack of fuel, more than 130,000 cubic metres of wastewater are being discharged into the Mediterranean Sea each day.
Salwa Islim, 45, said she and her family   and sometimes drink from it. 'I am forced to drink seawater and people here also do that,' she told Al Jazeera.
'Where is our right to water? What is this war that prevents all citizens from eating, drinking and all the other necessities of life?' she said.
'Is this a punishment for the children, who ask every day when the war will end? They stand in the streets and ask for bottles of water to drink. But there is no drinking water in Gaza".

US and Iran-backed groups trade fire in Syria. Will it get worse?

November 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United States and Iran-backed armed groups in the Middle East are increasingly trading fire in Syria since Israel launched its brutal military assault on the Gaza Strip on October 7.
US bases in Syria and neighbouring Iraq have been attacked multiple times, raising fears of regional escalation as Iran has warned against the mounting death toll in Gaza. More than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed in nearly 40 days of non-stop Israeli bombing.
So, what's the latest with the attacks, how closely tied are they to what's happening in Gaza, and how could this escalate?
How big are the strikes?
Iran-backed groups have attacked US forces in Syria and Iraq more than 50 times since the start of the Gaza war, with several attacks coming this week, according to US military officials.
The attacks, involving rockets, missiles and drones, have inflicted minor damage and have not killed any US soldiers.
Washington has warned that the attacks must stop. It has also launched retaliatory strikes, the latest of which came late on Sunday against two purportedly Iran-linked sites in Syria. One hit a training facility near Abu Kamal, with another targeting a safe house near Mayadin, both located in eastern Syria.
The Pentagon did not provide any details on the damage caused by the strikes, but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based monitoring group, said eight members of Iran-backed militiaswere killed in the attacks. Al Jazeera however could not independently verify the figure.
US officials said last week at least 56 US personnel have been injured in attacks in Syria and Iraq that started on October 17. Injuries ranged from minor wounds to traumatic brain injuries, but the Pentagon said all had been treated and they returned to work.
Are attacks directly linked to Israel's war on Gaza?
US officials have tried to emphasise that Pentagon strikes against the Iran-backed groups are not directly connected with the Gaza war. They say US strikes are rather acts of 'self-defence' that have not been carried out in coordination with Israel.
The attacks by regional armed groups have only intensified in recent years, particularly following the 2020 US assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, where Tehran-backed militias hold sway. The US has been retaliating against those strikes.
Israel, the US's closest ally in the region, has carried out numerous attacks on Syrian soil as well and has hit airports in Damascus and Aleppo multiple times since October as it seeks to limit the risk posed by Iran-backed forces in Syria.
Iran has been repeatedly warning since the start of the war in Gaza that   if Tel Aviv refuses to stop bombing civilians in the besieged strip, and the 'resistance axis' – regional political and armed groups allied with Tehran – forces may strike.
Lebanon's Hezbollah has already been engaged in border fighting with Israeli forces for more than a month, while Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen have launched multiple rounds of strikes on southern Israel.
The US has  , but Tehran maintains members of the axis act autonomously while sharing the goal of countering US hegemony in the region.
Hamidreza Azizi, a fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), said the attacks by Iran-backed groups are part of the response of the axis to the war in Gaza.
'As senior Iranian officials have repeatedly stated, the Islamic Republic believes that Washington's support is the main factor enabling Israel to continue and expand its military operations in Gaza with impunity,' he told Al Jazeera.
'In this way, it seems that Iran and its allies are trying to force the Biden administration to reconsider its approach to the war in Gaza by increasing costs for the United States, and indirectly pressuring Israel to stop its attacks."
He added that Iran and its allies are concerned over a considerable increase in US military presence in the region over the past month, which includes  .
Where does Syria stand on this?
Iran has considerable influence in Iraq and Syria and is a main backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who brutally quashed an opposition-led armed rebellion that erupted following peaceful protests in 2011.
In the chaos of the war, the US forces entered northeast Syria apparently in support of its Kurdish allies who fought against al-Assad. The Syrian government has repeatedly called for the 'occupation forces' of the US to withdraw from the country, halt their attacks on Syrian soil, and stop 'looting' its resources, including oil.
Washington maintains its forces are there to stop a resurgence of the ISIL (ISIS) armed group that took over large swaths of Syria and Iraq but was eventually defeated by an international coalition. The Kurdish forces backed by the US have been spearheading the anti-ISIL operation in Syria.
Like most Arab leaders across the region, al-Assad has expressed his serious opposition to the war in Gaza, denouncing Israel's strikes. Al-Assad's regional  .
Saudi Arabia on Saturday hosted a major Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh, where the Syrian president was also a speaker. He lambasted the 'vicious circle' of allowing Israel to commit massacres and then being content with allowing limited humanitarian aid instead of protecting Palestinians.
'A right cannot be restored when the criminal has become a judge and the thief has become a referee,' he said, referring to the role of Western countries in the Israeli bombing campaign of Gaza.
How could things escalate?
So far, the attacks on US forces in Syria have not caused serious damage. The only casualty the US forces have suffered was reported in Iraq. The Pentagon confirmed last month that a US contractor died of a heart attack while taking cover during an attack on a US base in Iraq's western al-Anbar governorate.
SWP's Azizi said the fact that there have been no reported casualties among US soldiers fits within Iran's calculated strategy.
"If American soldiers and personnel were killed, the United States would likely respond in a very serious manner, and we would witness a significant escalation. In turn, the US responses so far have been limited to targeting logistical centres and weapon depots used by Iran and its allies, avoiding human casualties. Thus, it is clear that both sides are adhering to some kind of unwritten rules of engagement," he said.
But this does create a risk of miscalculation on either side.
"For example, if American soldiers are killed in one of those attacks, the United States will definitely be forced to respond equally or even more severely. One should not forget that the Biden administration is already being criticized for what is seen as its weakness vis-a-vis Iran."

'Significant pause' needed in Gaza fighting to free captives: US official

The administration of United States President Joe Biden has said that securing the release of the more than 240 captives held by Hamas will require a 'very significant pause' in fighting in Gaza.
"It is something that is under a very serious and active discussion. But there is no agreement as of yet to actually get this done," a senior Biden administration official was quoted as saying by multiple news agencies on Friday.
The official, who spoke to journalists on condition of anonymity, said Washington was 'doing everything we possibly can' to get the captives out of Gaza, including 'indirect engagement'.
"We're hopeful and doing everything we possibly can to get the hostages out, but there's absolutely no guarantee, a – that it is going to happen, or b – when it's going to happen," the official was quoted as saying.
The official's remarks came after   until Hamas releases all captives, following a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Tel Aviv.
Pushing back against Blinken's call for 'humanitarian pauses' to protect civilians and allow aid into the besieged enclave, Netanyahu said Israel would continue 'full force' until all captives go free.
The Biden administration has been in constant discussion with Israel and "asking hard questions" about its objectives and whether it was achieving them, the official was quoted as saying.
Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed more than 1,400 people and took more than 240 others captive during its October 7 attacks on southern Israel, according to Israeli officials.
Many of the captives are believed to still be in Gaza, which has been under intense bombardment by Israeli forces for almost a month.
The Biden official was also quoted as saying that Hamas provided a list of injured Palestinians for evacuation, but it was deemed to be 'unacceptable' by the US, Israel and Egypt as one-third of the names were Hamas members.

Khan Younis, Gaza Strip – Niveen al-Barbari is terrified for her unborn child. With every Israeli air attack near her, the 33-year-old's back and stomach convulse with fear and pain.
Before the Israeli offensive began on October 7, al-Barbari regularly visited a specialist because she has gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. But the bombings forced her to seek shelter in her family's home, and she lost contact with her doctor.
"Every day," she said, "I wonder how I'll give birth and where. The bombs don't stop, and no human, tree or stone has been spared. We don't know whose house will be destroyed or who will die. I just hope me and my child are safe."
Al-Barbari is due to give birth to her first child this month, one of thousands of women in the Gaza Strip nearing the end of their pregnancies.

According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF), there are 50,000 pregnant women in the besieged territory, many suffering from a lack of regular check-ups and treatment because Gaza's healthcare system is on the brink of collapse due to the siege imposed by Israel on the territory. Last week, the UNPF called for "urgent health care and protection" of the pregnant women.
"All these images of babies and children under the rubble of their homes or lying in hospital with injuries makes me very scared for my baby," al-Barbari said. "Every day I pray for the war to end in order to save my child from these missiles that have no mercy on anyone."
According to Walid Abu Hatab, a medical consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, access to health centres has become very difficult, especially in light of the mass internal displacement of half the Gaza Strip's 2.3 million people over the past two weeks.
"There are women who have been displaced from their places of residence to other areas, which means changing the health centres which had previously monitored their condition," he told Al Jazeera. "This makes access to them very difficult for them as they need primary care and follow-up sessions during the various periods of pregnancy."
The displaced people, most of whom left northern Gaza and Gaza City for the south due to Israeli bombardment of residential areas, are staying with relatives, friends or at overcrowded UN-run schools, which Abu Hatab described as being mired in a "health and environment disaster".
"This may lead to cases of poisoning due to the unclean environment in the shelter centres," he said.

Fatigue amid displacement
For Suad Asraf, who is six months pregnant with her third child, her own displacement from the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City to a UN school in the southern city of Khan Younis has taken a toll on her, and she suffers from extreme fatigue.
"I am tired from the lack of sleep and fear," the 29-year-old said. "I have to take care of my two other children, but this shelter school has no clear water. I'm forced to drink saltwater, and I cannot stand it, and it also affects the pregnancy pressure I have."
Asraf wants to know if she and her unborn child are OK, especially after the terror she experienced. She tried to contact the UN health centre at the Shati camp numerous times on the phone but has not managed to get through once.
There isn't proper nutrition or care for her, and as a result, she always feels tired and nauseous. The schools are severely overcrowded and loud, and she cannot close her eyes for more than 30 minutes.
"There are also three pregnant women here, and their condition is similar to mine," Asraf said. "Two days ago, one of them lost consciousness, and we tried to help her.'

Fear of losing a child
Some women who became pregnant after many painful IVF cycles are worried that they will miscarry.
Laila Baraka, 30, is three months pregnant after a successful round of IVF following years of trying for a second child.
"All day, I'm scared of the sound of bombings, and at night, it is even more intense and terrifying," she said. "I hug my five-year-old son close as I try to swallow my fear, but I cannot. What we hear terrifies stones, not just humans."
Baraka, who is from Bani Suhaila, a town east of Khan Younis, moved to the centre of the bigger city thinking it would be safer. But the health centre she had gone to before is not responding to her calls after residents in the eastern area close to Israel's border fence have all fled.
"Even my doctor has been displaced from his home and communicating with him is very difficult," she said. "I'm lucky that my mother is constantly by my side and is trying in her own way to make me feel reassured and less stressed."
But that hardly works for Baraka, who feels exhausted from grieving over the images and footage of dead children on the news.
More than 6,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7, two-thirds of them children and women.
The hardest moment for Baraka was watching a doctor on TV seeing his baby grandchild, who was killed in an Israeli air strike and was born this year after five years of IVF treatments.
"Can you imagine this is the fate of our children?" she said. "What the mothers of Gaza experience can never be described."
Lack of treatment, access to health centres
The destruction of the Gaza Strip's main roads have increased the amount of time it takes for pregnant women to reach the few functional hospitals to give birth. A journey that would take only a few minutes by car can now take hours, putting the health of mothers at severe risk.
"An operation was performed on a woman the other day who was due to give birth and had severe bleeding," Abu Hatab said. "She was on the road for two hours trying to make it to the Nasser Medical Complex. After several attempts, we managed to control the bleeding and saved her life."
Israel has continuously threatened to target hospitals and repeatedly called on hospital staff and the tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians taking refuge at medical facilities to evacuate. Medical staff have refused to do so, pointing to the impossibility of moving their patients.
According to the Palestinian Family Planning and Protection Association , more than 37,000 pregnant women will be forced to give birth with no electricity or medical supplies in Gaza in the coming months, risking life-threatening complications without access to emergency obstetric services.
"I received dozens of calls from pregnant women telling me that they were unable to reach health centres to provide them with treatment such as insulin and treatment for blood thinning for those with heart disease," Abu Hatab said. "The lack of access to healthcare and treatment puts their lives in danger and may lead to death, and this is what we are mainly concerned about."

Iran warns of 'inevitable expansion' of Israel-Gaza war

An expansion of the scope of the war in Gaza is "inevitable" due to Israel's heightened aggression, according to Iran's foreign minister.
Hossein Amirabdollahian made the statement in a phone conversation with Qatari counterpart Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Iran's Press TV reported on Friday.
'Due to the expansion of the intensity of the war against Gaza's civilian residents, expansion of the scope of the war has become inevitable,' Amirabdollahian said.
It is unclear what he meant by an "inevitable expansion" of the conflict.
Separately, Amirabdollahian said on his X account on Thursday: 'Time is fast running out for Tel Aviv's crimes to continue.'
زمان برای تداوم جنایات تل‌آویو بسرعت رو به پایان است. تنها فايده نتانياهو اين بود كه پایه‌های رژیم جعلی اسراییل را متزلزل‌تر ساخت و چهره جنایتکار، خشن و متجاوز رژیم صهیونیستی را در قتل‌عام زنان و کودکان در غزه به روشنی و بدون روتوش به نمایش گذاشت. بی تردید آینده از آن فلسطین است.
- H.Amirabdollahian امیرعبداللهیان (@Amirabdolahian) November 9, 2023
'The only benefit of Netanyahu was that he made the foundations of the fake Israeli regime more shaky and showed the criminal, violent, and aggressive face of the Zionist regime in the massacre of women and children in Gaza,' he added.
"Undoubtedly, the future belongs to Palestine,' Amirabdollahian wrote.
Regional tension and cross-border clashes have intensified since Hamas, the Iran-backed group that runs Gaza, attacked Israel on October 7, triggering Israel's war on the enclave.
Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah armed group, which is allied to Hamas, have swapped attacks. More than 60 Hezbollah fighters and 10 civilians have been killed, Lebanese security officials say. The violence has also killed at least seven Israeli soldiers and one civilian.
United States and coalition troops have been attacked at least 40 times in Iraq and Syria by Iran-backed forces as tensions soar over Israel's bombardment. Forty-five US troops have been injured.
Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi  movement has also launched repeated missile and drone attacks on Israel since October 7, all of which were either shot down or fell short.
In a move viewed as a show of force to regional rivals, and especially Iran, the US announced last week that it has   in the Middle East.

US police rule out anti-Semitism in murder of synagogue head

October 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Detroit police have ruled out anti-Semitism as a motive for the violent murder of a local synagogue president over the weekend.
Samantha Woll, 40, was found lying on the ground outside her home on Saturday morning after being stabbed multiple times.
At the time of her death, Woll was the head of the Isaac Agree Downtown Detroit Synagogue and was well-known for her involvement in local and state politics.
Detroit police chief James White on Sunday quashed rumours and said in a statement that 'no evidence has surfaced suggesting this crime was motivated by antisemitism'.
Police are continuing their investigation with the assistance of the FBI, he said.
In an obituary published on the website of the Hebrew Memorial Chapel, where Woll's funeral was held on Sunday, the 40-year-old, was remembered as a patron of theatre, opera and music and a keen hiker.
Her death sparked an outpouring of grief in Jewish and Democratic circles.
US Representative Elissa Slotkin, on whose election campaign Woll worked, said in a statement that Woll had "dedicated her short life to building understanding across faiths, bringing light in the face of darkness."
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel rememberedWollas being driven by "her sincere love of her community, state and country."
"Sam was as kind a person as I've ever known," Nessel wrote on X, formerly called Twitter.
While Detroit is one of the United States' most violent cities, an uptick in anti-Semitism in the US following the Israel-Hamas war led to some speculation the crime might be racially or religiously motivated.
Woll's killing took place a week after the murder of a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy in Chicago in what authorities say was a hate crime motivated by the current fighting in the Middle East.
On Thursday, US Attorney General Merrick Garland addressed growing tension in some religious communities and directed local authorities to 'reaffirm our commitment to them and to assess what additional support they may need'.

Abu Saher al-Maghari: The man who shrouds the dead in Gaza

Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip – Inside a small narrow room with white tiles, one man works diligently every day, standing for long hours over a raised platform with white cloths hanging from the railings.
For more than a month, Abu Saher al-Maghari has stood over this platform, gently tending to the bodies that have been arriving at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza Strip.
The 53-year-old, who has a quiet air, has been shrouding the dead for 15 years at this hospital. But since the Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip began on October 7, al-Maghari has witnessed a huge influx of bodies, many of them mutilated.
When asked about the bodies he has seen, al-Maghari began crying.
'I have never experienced such a difficult time in my life,' al-Maghari said, wiping tears from his white beard.
'Throughout my years of work, I used to shroud from 30 to a maximum of 50 natural deaths daily, and in the case of previous Israeli military escalations, the number might reach about 60," he recalled.
Now, he shrouds about 100 bodies, and sometimes that number can rise up to 200, depending on the intensity of the bombing and the areas targeted by Israeli warplanes.
"Most of the bodies arrive at the hospital in very bad condition,' al-Maghari said. 'Torn limbs, severe bruises and deep wounds all over the body. I have never gone through anything like this before."
'My heart breaks over children's torn limbs'
The largest number of victims he receives are of children and women, and the nature of their injuries and wounds is unfamiliar to him.
'What saddens me most is shrouding children,' al-Maghari said. 'My heart breaks as I collect the children's torn limbs and put them in one shroud.What have they done?"
For the past 34 days, more than 10,800 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.
This number includes more than 4,400 children and 2,900 women, resulting in the United Nations secretary-general describing Gaza as a "  " for children.
According to Mohammed al-Hajj, the hospital's spokesman, the bodies of at least 2,476 Palestinians have arrived at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital since the beginning of the war on Gaza.

The hospital had a 200-bed capacity for patients before the war but was forced to add more due to the more than 5,300 wounded who have arrived at the hospital over the past month, al-Hajj said.
"We expanded the bed capacity to 431 beds, and this put us in front of a dilemma and challenge in terms of serving this expansion," he said.
Al-Maghari, who sometimes works with an assistant, has shrouded the bodies that have arrived at the hospital.
'I start my day shrouding the dead and killed from six in the morning until eight in the evening without stopping,' he told Al Jazeera after stealing a moment for the afternoon prayer.
Some of the bodies that arrive are already in an advanced state of decomposition with bones visible and an unbearable smell after lying for days under the rubble of bombed buildings.
Other bodies arrive in torn pieces, some burned beyond recognition, al-Mahgari said. This is something new, he said. The injuries are so unfamiliar to him that he wonders if the nature of the missiles and explosives used in the Israeli attacks are different from what has come before.
Moments of farewell – heartbreaking and cruel
Despite the daily horrors, al-Maghari goes about his job as always. He said it is his firm belief that family members must have the right to say goodbye to their loved ones.
"My mission presents me with a great challenge," he said. "The parents outside are going crazy in their grief, screaming and crying for their child. So I try to be as compassionate as I can be and work on making the bodies look presentable so that they can say goodbye."
Al-Maghari focuses on the general appearance of the dead, wiping away the blood and dust, then writing their names on their shrouds.
Surviving family members are especially shocked to see the torn body parts of their loved ones, which he places carefully in one shroud.
"These moments of the final farewell are always heartbreaking and cruel," he said. "Sometimes I receive bodies that have no features, due to explosive shrapnel. Here, I tie the shroud shut to spare the family members from remembering their loved ones in such a graphic state."
Often, he has to shroud bodies inside ambulances that arrive at the hospital because it is simply too difficult to carry the dismembered body parts to his workspace for washing and shrouding.
Al-Maghari said the number of bodies arriving at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital doubled after the mass displacement of Gaza City residents to the cities in the southern Gaza Strip, which increased after October 13.
'Every day, women, men and children, all of them civilians, are killed in Israeli attacks on their homes or public places or while travelling to the south," he said.

'No time to cry'
Al-Maghari believes that discussing the toll this work is taking on his mental health is a "luxury" in light of the catastrophic conditions the health sector is enduring.
'Dealing with this number of torn and burned bodies, most of them children, requires a high level of psychological toughness that not every human being possesses," he said. "I face a real test every day. There is no time to cry or break down at the same time, but we are only human."
Al-Maghari's work in these dangerous conditions does not leave him the opportunity to think about his family, who lives in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the centre of Gaza City.
'Like all parents, I fear for my family, but I can barely communicate with them or be reassured," the father of five children said.
'When I return home, I am unable to talk to my family at all,' he added. 'All I ask of them is to leave me alone, even if they miss me. It's beyond my control."
As the Israeli bombardment and ground offensive continues, he knows it is possible that Israeli strikes could hit closer to home.
"I often imagine that my children could be among the victims that I will shroud at any moment," al-Maghari said. "Everyone is being targeted, without exception."

WHO warns hospitals in besieged Gaza Strip are at 'breaking point'

October 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The World Health Organization has called for immediate humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip, warning Israel's blockade and   have left the enclave's health system at "breaking point".
Noting Gaza's overstretched hospitals had only a few hours of electricity a day, with fuel being rationed to maintain critical services including intensive care, and X-ray and dialysis services, the United Nations' health agency called for the opening of a humanitarian corridor to allow health workers into the territory, as well as the evacuation of the sick and injured.
It said shortages of medical supplies were also severe and that time was running out to prevent a humanitarian disaster in a territory that is home to more than two million people.
'Without the immediate entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza - especially health services, medical supplies, food, clean water, fuel, and non-food items - humanitarian and health partners will be unable to respond to urgent needs of people who desperately need it," the agency said in a statement late on Thursday. "Each lost hour puts more lives at risk.'
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also raised concern about the deteriorating situation in Gaza, describing the situation as "abhorrent".
"As Gaza loses power, hospitals lose power, putting newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen at risk. Kidney dialysis stops, and X-rays can't be taken," Fabrizio Carboni, the regional director for the Near and Middle East for the ICRC said in a statement on Friday. "Without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues."
Israel has said it has dropped about   on Gaza since it began its bombardment almost a week ago following an   by the armed Hamas group that caught its security forces off-guard and killed more than 1,300 Israelis.
At least 1,500 Palestinians have been killed in the subsequent onslaught and thousands more injured as Israel prepares for a possible ground assault on the enclave.
Gaza has about 30 hospitals, 13 of them operated by the Ministry of Health and others privately run.
The WHO said it had documented 34   in Gaza since Saturday. By yesterday, 11 WHO health workers had been killed while 16 were injured. Another five ICRC workers were killed. The WHO said 20 ambulances had also been hit.
The agency called for the immediate opening of the Rafah border crossing on the border with Egypt.
"WHO is ready to immediately dispatch trauma and essential health supplies … to ensure that they can reach the Gaza Strip via the Rafah border crossing," the WHO said. "Urgent access through the crossing is essential so that WHO and other humanitarian agencies can act quickly to help save lives."

Chaos, fear reign as foreign nationals try to leave Gaza through Rafah

November 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
When Fady Abukhousa travelled to the Gaza Strip some weeks ago from Australia, he never imagined the nightmare scenario he would find himself in.
He, his wife Amani, and their two young children, Mohammed and Yazan - all of whom are Australian citizens - were visiting family in the besieged enclave.
Abukhousa left for home early, returning to Sydney in late September, leaving behind his wife and children. Now, they're trapped in the blockaded enclave amid Israel's devastating bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip. Also stuck areother members of his family who aren't citizens of Australia, including his mother and brother.
'It's really hard,' Abukhousa told Al Jazeera, adding that his children, aged seven and 10, can't sleep at night because of the relentless bombing.
Since he learned that the border crossing linking Egypt with the Gaza Strip   to allow a limited number of critically wounded people and foreign nationals to exit, Abukhousa has been desperately trying to reach his family.
His wife and children, along with some 500 other people, are part of a list of foreign and dual nationals that the Gaza Borders and Crossings Authority said it contacted early Wednesday, urging them to leave for the Rafah border crossing.
But due to a communications blackout that Israel reimposed on Gaza overnight, Abukhousa has no idea if they got the news, as he hasn't heard from them in two days.
His situation is emblematic of the challenges that persist in getting   and away from Israel's bombardment of the strip after Hamas's attack on southern Israel on October 7.
'I don't think they know [the crossing] is open,' said Abukhousa, referring to his family.
His family has made the trek to the crossing four times already in the last few weeks, as they shelter about a 20-minute drive away, at the Bureij refugee camp located in the central Gaza Strip.
But they left each time, realising it remains closed, with the situation at the border too dangerous for them to stay.
The Australian embassy, meanwhile, has told Abukhousa they can't do much to help his family.

No security, bombs everywhere
In the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, Nadia Eldin shares Abukhousa's desperation.
Eldin isn't a dual citizen or foreign national herself. But her daughter Lama is a citizen of Bulgaria, born in the European country when the Eldin family lived there some 15 years ago.
While Lama is on the Gaza Borders and Crossings Authority's list, she didn't receive a call telling her to head to the Rafah border, her mother said.
Instead, Eldin got a call from friends in Ramallah on Wednesday, as a trickle of communications was restored, urging them to head to the crossing.
The mother of three wants to go desperately, to seek shelter with relatives she has in Cairo, Egypt, but the family has no car - nor the confidence that they will not be bombed along the way, she said.
'What shall I do now?' Eldin wondered, sobbing as she spoke to Al Jazeera over the phone. 'There is no security. Bombs everywhere.'
As she spoke, she noted that her phone battery was dying. She is only able to charge it using a generator for brief periods during the day.
Meanwhile, it is unclear whether people hoping to cross at Rafah need Egyptian visas.
Amena Nasrate is taking no chances. Her mother and grandmother are in Gaza. The Palestinian student in Cairo, who is also an Australian citizen, was on Wednesday headed to her country's embassy in Egypt to get visas for her relatives once she heard of the crossing's opening.
Nasrate's father, Sam, is also on the Gaza Borders and Crossings Authority's list, as an Australian citizen. He, too, remains in Gaza.
'The situation is getting worse,' she told Al Jazeera, frantic to get her family out.

No safe passageways
Al Jazeera spoke to four other dual nationals on the Gaza Borders and Crossings Authority's list.
Two of them, with dual nationalities from Japan and Indonesia, respectively, did not receive calls from their embassies or any other authorities telling them to head to the border crossing.
One woman, Samira Ismail Abusharkh, with dual nationality in Austria, said she received a call from the Austrian embassy requesting that she and her husband head to the Rafah crossing, but they did not provide them with information about transportation means, she told Al Jazeera.
Another man, whose two children named Islam and Hisham hold Japanese nationality, was told by the Japanese embassy to head to the Rafah crossing.
But air strikes are continuing around them and there is no safe passageway out, he told Al Jazeera.
Back in Sydney, Abukhousa said he was shocked at the pace of the conflict and its destruction, as he waited to hear from his family once again.
'The situation is very harsh,' he said.

November 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Five Republican   in the United States have clashed in their latest debate over a host of issues, including the war in Gaza, immigration and their difficult quest to win the nomination against former President Donald Trump.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former envoy to the United Nations Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Governor  , entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Senator Tim Scott sparred on the stage of the third debate of the campaign in Miami, Florida on Wednesday.
The stage was downsized from   in September with former Vice President Mike Pence suspending his campaign and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum failing to qualify.
Trump, who remains the distant frontrunner despite his mounting  , once again decided to skip proceedings.
The war in Gaza and its international and domestic implications dominated the first part of the debate, but the candidates' support for Israel kept resurfacing even when discussing other topics.
Haley   – who remain longshot candidates – deepened their rivalry, exchanging jabs throughout the evening.
Scott, who cut a quiet figure in the previous debate, delivered a more assertive performance, claiming more speaking time.
DeSantis, long seen as the   threat to Trump's grip on the party's nomination, promoted his conservative record in Florida while criticising President Joe Biden's policies.
Here are five key takeaways from the debate.
'Finish them': Pro-Israel stances
Despite Biden's unwavering support for Israel, including pushing for more than $14bn in additional aid to the country, Republican candidates tried to outdo the Democratic president in backing the US ally.
DeSantis said he would tell Israeli Prime Minister  to "finish the job once and for all" with Hamas.
"They're terrorists. They're massacring innocent people. They would wipe every Jew off the globe if they could," he said.
Haley echoed the governor's comment, saying she would also tell Netanyahu to "finish them".
"It is not that Israel needs America. America needs Israel," she said. "They are the tip of the spear when it comes to this Islamic terrorism and we need to make sure that we have their backs in that process."
Ramaswamy also voiced support for Israel, but he distinguished himself from the rest of the pack by warning against US military involvement in the war.
"I want to be careful to avoid making the mistakes from the neo-con establishment of the past," he said.
"Corrupt politicians in both parties spent trillions, killed millions, made billions for themselves in places   and Afghanistan – fighting wars that sent thousands of our sons and daughters, people my age, to die in wars that did not advance anyone's interests."
None of the candidates mentioned the words "Palestinians" or "Palestine" when addressing the crisis.
Hawkishness on Iran
The candidates also displayed hawkishness towards Iran as US troops   from Tehran-allied groups in Iraq and Syria amid the war in Gaza.
Scott appeared to call for a direct show of force against Iran.
"You cannot just continue to have strikes in Syria on warehouses," he said, referring to a   on an Iran-linked "weapons storage" facility in Syria earlier in the day.
"You actually have to cut off the head of the snake, and the head of the snake is Iran, and not simply the proxies."
Haley also said she would take more forceful action against Iran and its allies.
"Iran responds to strike," she said. "You punch them once, and you punch them hard, and they will back off."
DeSantis also issued a threat to Iran when it comes to attacking US soldiers in the Middle East. "I would say to Iran: You harm a hair on the head of an American service member, and you are going to have hell to pay," he said.

Chasm over Ukraine persists
As in previous debates, the candidates were divided over aid to Ukraine, with Ramaswamy voicing opposition to additional assistance to Kyiv, drawing criticism from fellow contenders.
Ramaswamy accused Ukraine of failing to be a democratic country, citing the consolidation of television channels into one state-run outlet and uncertainty over next year's election. He also described Ukrainian President   as a "comedian in cargo pants".
"To frame this as some kind of battle between good versus evil, don't buy it," he said.
The US has provided   with tens of billions of dollars to fend off a full-scale Russian invasion that Moscow launched in February 2022.
Haley was quick to reject Ramaswamy's position, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping would be "salivating at the thought that someone like that could become president" of the US.
The former US ambassador linked the conflict in Ukraine to the war in Gaza.
"There is a reason Ukrainians want us to support Israelis – because they know that if Iran wins, Russia wins," she said.
For his part, DeSantis criticised Biden's request for more aid to Ukraine, calling for more resources to be dedicated to the competition with China in the Asia-Pacific region.
"We need to bring this war to an end," he said of the Ukraine conflict. "We need the Europeans to step up and do their fair share."
Focus on China
Amid the intensifying US  , the candidates appeared to be in agreement over prioritising the Washington-Beijing rivalry.
Christie called China "the enemy", saying he would bolster the US nuclear submarine arsenal to confront Beijing in case it decides to invade Taiwan.
"The nuclear submarines in the United States Navy [are] the greatest deterrent to Chinese aggression, and that is the first place I would go to increase American naval power," he said.
For her part, Haley blamed China for bringing fentanyl – a deadly,   – to the US.
"We will end all formal trade relations with China until they stop murdering Americans from fentanyl," she said. The US imports more goods from China than any other country.
DeSantis warned that if China becomes the world's leading superpower, it would affect Americans in direct ways. "They will export authoritarianism all around the world as the cost of doing business," he said.
More arrows at Trump
With Trump leading the race by more than 50 percentage points to his closest rival according to some polls, the other candidates have a mountain to climb ahead of the first primary race in Iowa in January.
The former president is facing four sets of  , including over his efforts to overturn the 2020 elections.
On Wednesday, several candidates took aim directly at Trump, who had been largely spared serious attacks from rivals so far.
DeSantis hit out at Trump for refusing to attend the debates, invoking the former president's unfulfilled promise to   on the US's southern border and have Mexico pay for it.
"He owes it to you to be on this stage and explain why he should get another chance," the Florida governor said of Trump. "He should explain why he didn't have Mexico pay for the border wall. He should explain why he racked up so much debt."
Christie, a Trump critic, pointed to Trump's legal troubles as well. "Anybody who is going to be spending the next year and a half of their life focusing on keeping themselves out of jail and courtrooms cannot lead this party or this country," he said.

Israel strikes Syria, Lebanon following rocket attacks, military says

Israel has carried out strikes against military infrastructure in Syria and Lebanon, its military has said, amid concerns the country's offensive against Hamas could devolve into broader conflict across the Middle East.
Israeli fighter jets struck rocket launchers in Syria and Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in response to earlier rocket launches into Israeli territory, Israel's military said early on Monday.
Israeli military officials did not provide further details about the attacks, including possible casualties. Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the attacks or their impact.
Israel's military has been engaged in cross-border fighting with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and has launched repeated air raids on Syria since launching its war on Hamas.

The United States has also carried out attacks on Syria in response to a sharp rise in rocket and drone attacks on its forces in the country as well as Iraq, which it has blamed on Iran-backed proxy groups.
On Thursday, the Pentagon said it had carried out strikes on two facilities in Syria used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iran-backed groups after President Joe Biden earlier pledged to respond to attacks on US personnel.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned of regional escalation if Israel continues its war against Hamas, saying earlier this month that, "Muslims and resistance forces will become impatient, and no one can stop them."
Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the conflict could spill "beyond the borders of the Middle East" if Israel did not end its bombardment of Gaza.
US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday said in an interview with ABC News that there is a 'real' risk of the war escalating into a wider regional conflict.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told CNN on Saturday that his country did not want to see the war spread and that it was 'totally wrong' for Washington to blame Tehran for attacks on its forces without providing proof.
Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, has denied any role in Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel. US and Israeli officials have said they have not found evidence of its involvement.
Iranian government officials, however, offered their congratulations to the Palestinian armed group, describing the surprise attack as a victory for 'the anti-Zionist resistance".

Analysis: What will Israel do with all its mobilised soldiers?

October 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Following last week's surprise attacks and unprecedented incursion by Hamas fighters, Israel officially declared a state of war and initiated an enormous mobilisation.
Sources report that 360,000 reservists have been summoned. They will supplement an active military force of more than 150,000, giving Israel half a million men and women in uniform.
What is the purpose of raising such a large army and how will it be used?
Three functions, one force
In most of the world's armies that use conscripts, increasing the number of soldiers threefold would usually take months rather than weeks. Israel will achieve that much faster, at most in a couple of weeks.
Key elements that allow for such quick massing of forces include the population's awareness of the need to actively participate in defence, intensive training during compulsory military service that lasts three years for males and two for females, refresher periods in active reserve of several weeks every year, good planning, tested and proven in numerous past international and internal conflicts, and fairly small territory with short distances between even the furthest points.
 
Reservists can report to their stations or barracks so quickly that the system often deliberately slows down the intake rate to be able to process all the arrivals. Nevertheless, the build-up will be fast and it can be assumed that, by the coming weekend, the Israeli army will have at least half of the declared reservists on duty at their designated locations.
Will Gaza be attacked by half a million soldiers? No, that idea has certainly not even been contemplated by the Israeli high command.
Each military force needs a certain manoeuvring space and putting more soldiers than optimally needed into any territory does not increase the chances of success, on the contrary, often it can lead to chaos on the battlefield.
But if they are not going to be used to storm Gaza, why go to the trouble of having half a million armed men and women?
Because they will need to provide three main functions: an offensive force, a defensive force and an internal security force.
The offensive force will be deployed in positions from which it can attack Gaza and achieve whatever military objectives are put before it by the Israeli command. Those will be discussed in the following days in this analysis.

The size of that force will be determined by its precise task, which is not known and is certainly one of the most closely guarded Israeli military secrets. But it will also be determined, or limited, by the size of the potential battlefield: the line of contact between the Gaza Strip and Israel is merely 51km (32 miles) long.
Conventional military calculations indicate that whatever the final aim of the forces set against Gaza, their size will be well under 100,000, possibly just half of that number.
The main purpose of the second arm, the defensive force, will be to act as a deterrent to possible attacks across its four international borders.
The least of Israel's worries is the border with Jordan, with which it has stable and almost friendly relations. The line demarcating the southern desert border with Egypt is a little riskier due to the possibility of incursions of military groups from Sinai into the Naqab (Negev) desert.
But both countries generally want to respect the agreements signed with Israel and it is almost certain that their leaders are not contemplating unleashing their armies on Israel.
Next in the line of worry is the land border with Syria over the demilitarised zone in the Golan Heights.
President Bashar al-Assad has enough security worries in his troubled and devastated country without embarking on any adventure against Israel but any of dozens of armed factions in Syria may want to contribute to what they see as the Palestinian cause.
Lightly armed and thinly spread United Nations troops holding the demilitarised zone (DMZ) would be no match for a dedicated force, so Israel must cover that possibility too.
By far the biggest worry for the Israeli leadership is the Hezbollah fighters on the other side of the 120km (75-mile) border with Lebanon. The Shia militia is a battle-proven, tough, militarily competent, well-equipped and disciplined organisation.
It is also the only Arab combat force, even though not a national army, that was victorious over Israel on the battleground, forcing it to retreat from Southern Lebanon in 2000.
Hezbollah has an estimated arsenal of more than 40,000 rockets that can hit deep inside Israel, tens of thousands of highly motivated fighters and equipment that can deliver a hard punch. As such, Israel will likely have to deploy substantial reserves to face it, staging them in several layers to prevent any nasty surprise in the north.
The third role of the armed forces, internal security, will represent the largest zone of responsibility for the Israeli army.
To be continued.

Analysis: Why Biden is pressuring Israel on Gaza 'humanitarian pauses'

Over the past weeks, dozens of countries and leaders have asked Israel, directly, indirectly and through the United Nations, to temporarily cease assaults on Gaza. Pleas were ignored or turned down; the   in technicalities and semantics.
In a surprise announcement on Thursday, the White House claimed that Israel would allow 'limited  ' in its military operations 'for humanitarian reasons'. None has happened so far, but a promise is a promise.
At the same time, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Gaza should not be   and that Palestinians who fled Gaza City should be allowed to return.
All of this, even as the US has bolstered its military presence in the region, with two aircraft carrier battle groups deployed in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, and additional air and land forces reinforcing friendly bases throughout the region. Some of the 3,400 US troops in Iraq and Syria have nevertheless come under isolated and unprecise missile and drone attacks, apparently from various sub-state armed groups. The US has also rushed   of weapons and ammunition to Israel.
So what is really happening?
Israel is the traditional, strongest and guaranteed American strategic partner in the Middle East, and it is unlikely that, whatever the differences between their administrations may be, that position will ever change. But the US needs its Arab strategic partners, too.
In deciding on its Middle Eastern policies and strategies, Washington has many factors to consider. They include, among other things, regional and global security, its relations with Iran, security and cost of oil and gas supplies, freedom and security of international shipping lanes, and containing the influence of Russia and  . It is a complicated mix, even at the best of times.
When policies are formulated and implemented by amateurs guided by the partiality of private inclinations, it often spoils years of hard work. Such was the case during the four disastrous years of the Trump administration's off-the-hip approach to the Middle East. The president's main 'expert' was his then 37-year-old son-in-law. His proposed 'peace plan' was fodder for Israeli hawks, but stunned and angered Palestinians.
Stepping back from current Gaza-related issues, it is obvious that most American problems in the Middle East originate from two fundamental reasons: the end of the bipolar world and Washington's relations with Iran.
For 50 years after World War II, the division between the American-dominated West and Eastern Communism led by the Soviet Union directed political allegiances.
In the Middle East, Israel was in the American camp, as were Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Gulf states; Syria, Egypt, Iraq and Libya were on the Soviet side. Convincing Egypt to change its allegiance from East to West and sign the peace accord with Israel in 1978 was one of Washington's major strategic victories in the Middle East during the Cold War.
Under the rule of the shah, Iran probably had the most pro-American regime from the Mediterranean to the Pacific, but that equation flipped on its head after the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Overnight, the US became Iran's biggest enemy.
In the best tradition of pragmatic foreign policy, the US encouraged and helped Saddam Hussein's Iraq to  , Iran. The war that dragged on for almost 10 years was practically, if not directly, a US proxy war against Iran. The US fought another proxy war through the mujahideen against Soviet-controlled Afghanistan.
While the Cold War was often hard and unfair on the interests of individual small countries involved, the bipolar strategic paradigm had its advantages: Both big protectors took care not to allow local troubles to explode into major wars, usually with success.
When communism caved in, the West allowed itself to proclaim 'the end of history,' believing that it had won its big strategic struggle once and forever, and that future confrontations would be small and easily controllable. What a mistake.
In less than a decade, the US allowed its regional oversight and insight into potential trouble spots to wilt.
With much weakened analytical capabilities, the United States ignorantly, arrogantly and overconfidently let itself be led into three successive wars that ended in embarrassing setbacks for Washington.
After years of being bogged down in Iraq, the US hastily pulled out when it realised that continuing there cost too much in soldiers' lives, money and especially its reputation in the Middle East and Islamic countries. In a similar fashion, it pulled out of Afghanistan a decade later.
Washington repeated the mistake it made in Iraq by getting involved in the Syrian war, although this time it did not invade openly. Its support for anti-government factions ended up helping, of all factions, the pro-Iranian armed groups gain influence and strength. Syria also cemented its ties with Moscow. The end result: Iran spread its regional influence, and the US failed to check it.
Other regional conflicts, too, have shown the limits of US power and influence — whether in its failure to stop the war between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis in Yemen, or to end the impasse in Libya.
It is then understandable, that in the year prior to the 2024 elections, Biden wants to appear active in the region with a more balanced approach, aimed at demonstrating that the US still does have the ability to mediate peace.
If that means mentioning some things that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his hardline cabinet don't want to hear — let alone heed — so be it.

Thai official meets with Hamas in Iran to seek hostage release

Muslim Thai officials have reported that they met with Hamas in Iran as they bid to secure the release of hostages being held in Gaza by the Palestinian group.
Thai politician Areepen Uttarasin said on Friday that he held "direct talks" with Hamas officials in Iran to discuss the issue. The talks took place in the Iranian capital, Tehran, on October 26 and lasted two hours, he reported.
"I told them that I am here not to negotiate but simply to ask for their release," said Areepen, who declined to name the Hamas officials he met with.
The Hamas officials told the lawmaker that the Thai captives were safe and well looked after. But they did not agree to a date for the release of the captives, he added, saying they were "waiting for the right time".
At least 23 Thai nationals were among more than 240 people kidnapped by Hamas during the group's unprecedented attacks on Israel on October 7. Of the more than 1,405 people Israel says were killed in the attacks, at least 32 were Thai.
Thailand's Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin spoke to Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone on Wednesday and received assurances that Israel is making every effort to free all of the captives, including Thai nationals. Netanyahu also pledged to ensure care for all foreign nationals.
However, according to local media, the Thai government is planning a mass evacuation of its nationals from Israel this week, fearing the escalating situation on the ground.
Israel ranks third behind South Korea and Taiwan for registered   and about 30,000 Thai labourers work in Israel, mostly in the agriculture sector.
Earlier, Thailand's Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara said Qatar, Iran and Egypt had agreed to send Thailand's request to free the hostages to Hamas immediately.
"I wanted them to convey that to Hamas because I'm worried Hamas doesn't know that they are just agriculture workers," Parnpree told a press conference.
On the 'Thai labourers in Israel' Facebook page, desperate relatives of the captives have listed the home towns they hail from which include some of the poorest places in Thailand, like Kalasin, Surin and Sisaket.
Despite the dangers, some Thais in the group also said that opportunity must come before their security. One worker said he would go back [to Israel], no matter how bad the security situation gets.
In the rush of comments that followed, another post summarised the feelings of many Thai overseas workers: 'Poverty is scarier.'

Israel using white phosphorus in Gaza, Lebanon, endangering civilians: HRW

October 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel has used white phosphorus in its continuing military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, putting civilians at serious risk, Human Rights Watch has said, following an analysis of video of the conflict.
Human Rights Watch said it verified footage taken in Lebanon and Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, showing multiple uses of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and two rural locations along the Israel-Lebanon border.
Human Rights Watch also interviewed two people who described an attack in Gaza, the rights group said.
HRW said the use of white phosphorus in densely populated areas violates Israel's obligation under international law to take all feasible precautions to avoid harm to civilians.
'Any time that white phosphorus is used in crowded civilian areas, it poses a high risk of excruciating burns and lifelong suffering,' Lama Fakih, HRW's director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement on Wednesday.
'White phosphorus is unlawfully indiscriminate when airburst in populated urban areas, where it can burn down houses and cause egregious harm to civilians.'
Israel should ban all use of 'airburst' white phosphorus munitions in populated areas without exception, the rights group said, noting the availability of non-lethal alternatives.
White phosphorus, which can cause bone-deep burns resulting in death or lifelong injuries, can be used to generate smokescreens, mark targets and incinerate enemy targets.
While the use of the substance in warzones is not banned outright under international law, use near civilians is prohibited under the United Nations Convention on Conventional Weapons, to which Israel is not a signatory.
Israel's defence ministry did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment.
But Israel's military was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying it was "currently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorus in Gaza'.
Officials did not provide comment on the alleged use of the chemical in Lebanon, Reuters said.
Israel used white phosphorus extensively during its bombardment of Gaza in 2009, drawing widespread condemnation.
In 2013, the Israeli military said it would no longer use white phosphorus in populated areas except in exceptional circumstances, following a petition to Israel's High Court.
Israel has pledged to eradicate Hamas from Gaza following the armed group's deadliest attack inside the country in decades over the weekend.
Israeli air strikes on Gaza have killed more than 1,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 6,600 others, according to officials in the enclave.
More than 1,300 people were killed and 3,000 injured in Hamas's multi-pronged attack on southern Israeli towns on Saturday, according to Israeli officials.

Israel has cut Gaza's telecommunication and internet services for a second time despite humanitarian aid agencies warning that such blackouts severely disrupt their work in an already dire situation in the war-torn Palestinian enclave.
Telecom provider Paltel reported a 'complete disruption' of communications and internet services in Gaza on Wednesday morning.
The disruption comes after Israel imposed a near-complete   on Gaza from Friday to Sunday that lasted close to 36 hours.
Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud, providing sporadic updates via satellite from Khan Younis, southern Gaza, said on Wednesday that the blackout sent 'waves of concern and fear among people and evacuees in the southern part of Gaza who still have family members remaining in the northern part and Gaza City'.
'This blackout is very tragic for people here and an indication that something serious is going on," he reported. The lack of communication only intensifies people's concerns "about what's going to happen to their relatives and loved ones', he added.
'The difficult part is the inability to know exactly what's going on. It becomes increasingly difficult to understand the situation in Gaza City and the northern part as Israeli tanks move to separate the north from the south.'
'The blackout also puts the work of humanitarian agencies that try to help people on the ground in jeopardy as they lose contact with their team members. Things are becoming very difficult.'
'Potential war crimes'
Israel used the previous shutdown to 'cover potential war crimes as they started their ground invasion', said Marwa Fatafta, the Middle East and North Africa policy and advocacy manager at Access Now, a global human rights organisation.
Israel is using internet blackouts as a 'warfare tactic to induce more pain on the population', Fatafta told Al Jazeera.
Even outside the blackouts, communications in Gaza is 'sporadic and unreliable', she added, with Gaza's G2 mobile network 'crushed further' by fuel shortages and damage to infrastructure.
On Monday, US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council that the United States made clear to Israel that it was concerned about a shutdown of communications in the Gaza Strip.
"A shutdown of telecommunication imperils the lives of civilians, UN personnel and humanitarian workers and risks exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza," she said.
During the previous blackout, Israel's chief military spokesperson declined to say whether Israel was behind it but said it would do whatever needed to protect its forces.
Asked whether Israel had knocked out mobile services at the start of the ground offensive that began on Friday night, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said: "We do what we have to do to secure our forces for as long as we must, temporary or permanent, as much as we need to and we will not say anything further about that."
On Saturday, Elon Musk said he would offer his  internet service to 'internationally recognised aid organisations' in Gaza, prompting protests by Israel.
'Hamas will use it for terrorist activities,' Israel's Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said on X, referring to the group that rules Gaza.
'Perhaps Musk would be willing to condition it with the release of our abducted babies, sons, daughters, elderly people. All of them! By then, my office will cut any ties with Starlink.'

Xi and Scholz talk economy, deepening global crises in video call

Chinese President Xi Jinping and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have held talks over video at a time when the European Union is trying to reduce its dependence on the world's second-largest economy.
"China regards Europe as a comprehensive strategic partner and an important pole in a multipolar world," state broadcaster CCTV reported Xi as telling Scholz on Friday.
"It is hoped that Germany will push the EU to uphold the principles of marketisation and fairness, and work with China to safeguard fair market competition and free trade," he said.
The Chinese president also mentioned new policies aimed at encouraging foreign investment in China and "major steps" such as "lifting restrictions on foreign investment access in the manufacturing sector" and advancing further opening in "cross-border service trade and investment".
Tensions between China and the EU are growing over issues including Beijing's growing relationship with Russia as well as some of its unfair trade practices.
China is the EU's second-largest trading partner, but the 27-nation bloc has also become more vocal about "de-risking" their political and economic exposure to the country.
In September, the European Commission launched an   into Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports, which it says may benefit unfairly from state subsidies. The findings of the investigation could not only impact Chinese EVs, but also foreign EVs manufactured in China, such as Tesla and BMW.
The investigation is the most high-profile of its kind since the EU investigated solar panels in 2013.
As Europe's largest economy, however, Germany has maintained more friendly relations with China than some of its EU counterparts thanks to its high volume of bilateral trade. Scholz was the first European leader to   after Xi began a third and unprecedented term in office.
Xi spoke of this close relationship during his meeting with Scholz, describing the two countries as "responsible major powers" that must "develop bilateral relations well and set an example for win-win cooperation", according to state media.
They also discussed the worsening international situation with the world grappling with the war in Gaza as well as Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
Xi said China and Germany must safeguard the international order and multilateralism, and work together to address global challenges, according to state media.
In their meeting last November, both leaders jointly condemned threats of using nuclear weapons as the Ukraine-Russia conflict escalated.
This time they spoke a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed Moscow's   of the landmark global nuclear test ban treaty and amid  .
State media said Xi pointed out that "whether it is the Palestinian-Israeli conflict or the Ukraine crisis, to solve the root cause, it is necessary to think more deeply about security issues and promote the construction of a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture".

'Supplies exhausted, doctors exhausted': In Gaza, catastrophe looms large

After seven days of relentless Israeli bombardment, the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is rapidly deteriorating.
Hospitals in the northern part of the besieged enclave have received   ahead of a looming ground offensive, while medical facilities throughout the densely populated territory are overwhelmed by wounded patients and sheltering residents.
Conditions are particularly dire at Shifa Hospital, the largest medical complex in Gaza City, where Palestinian doctors warn of an impending infectious disease outbreak due to overcrowding.
'There are thousands – if not tens of thousands – of people who have flocked to the hospital," surgeon Ghassan Abu Sitta told Al Jazeera on Saturday.
"They are sleeping on the ground, in the corridors, between patients' beds. People are absolutely terrified. They think this is the safest place and everything around them confirms that," he said.
'Unless there is respite there is going to be a public health catastrophe at the hospital."
As Israeli bombs rain down on Gaza in retaliation to an unprecedented attack by Hamas last week inside Israel, bodies are piling up and people are afraid to bury the dead. The situation is so bad that   as hospital morgues are full due to the rising death toll – more than 2,200 people as of Saturday, according to health officials.
Abu Sitta said he left Al-Awda Hospital, in the northern Gaza Strip, on Friday after Israeli forces gave the facility two hours to evacuate.
'We made sure the patients were in ambulances and I came back to Al-Shifa Hospital,' he said. 'We drove past the Indonesian Hospital and you could see the bodies are piled up outside the morgue. They've run out of space. Driving past the destroyed building, the stench was very strong.'
Medics at Shifa were no longer able to operate beyond life-saving surgeries, he said. 'The supplies have been exhausted but the staff have also been exhausted. A lot of them have been killed, had family members killed, or are trying to secure their families."
Abu Sitta said his colleague Medhat Saidam, whom he described as a 'lovely man' with whom he had worked since the 2008-2009 war, was killed after escorting his sister to her house. 'He decided to stay with them overnight and at 1am he was killed with all of his family,' Abu Sitta said.
According to the surgeon, Israeli forces were 'threatening to close' more hospitals, including the Al-Durrah paediatric hospital in eastern Gaza and Al-Quds hospital in Gaza City.
Mahmoud Shalabi, programme manager in Gaza for the United Kingdom-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said people were also running out of water and bread. 'All the bakeries are now closed,' he said.
Even if bread was to be found, banks have also been damaged and finding cash is becoming increasingly difficult. 'I went to the ATM to withdraw money, but the bank was destroyed due to the bombing,' Shalabi said. 'The only ATM machine working is in the middle of Rimal area, which is far away from where I live.'
He described Friday night as 'horrific'.
'Artillery shelling was everywhere; air raids, gunpowder was everywhere in the air and we were breathing it heavily,' Shalabi said.
In the hospital, people with wounds, burns and injuries do not have painkillers to soothe their suffering. 'Nurses just stop the bleeding and say: 'Wait for your turn',' Shalabi reported.
Aid delivery 'must happen'
Home to more than 2.3 million people, Gaza has been under a crippling land, sea and air blockade since 2007. Earlier this week, Israel announced it was imposing a "total siege" on the enclave in response to Hamas's October 7 attack that killed more than 1,300 people, according to Israeli officials.
The Israeli army has since unleashed its heaviest-ever bombing campaign on the Hamas-run coastal enclave, dropping some 6,000 bombs in six days, and cutting off access to food, fuel, medicine and other supplies.
As time is running out, the World Health Organization stressed that the delivery of aid to Gaza 'must happen'.
'Hospitals are overwhelmed, people cannot get treatment, kids with burns have no pain relief - it's absolutely critical,' spokesperson Margaret Harris told Al Jazeera.
Following a meeting with the United Nations health agency's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Egypt agreed to open the border for humanitarian deliveries.
The agency is ready to bring international aid into the Gaza Strip, preventing many avoidable deaths, but has been so far been unable to do so as Israel has not given permission.
'This is very frustrating,' Harris said. 'The will to open that border is the thing that's missing.'
Meanwhile, the health ministry in Gaza has denounced what it called 'direct and systematic attacks  '.
Shalabi also said systematic attacks against these vehicles were taking place, in breach of international law.
'This morning I saw people taking dead bodies in their own cars because ambulances are being targeted, so it's really unsafe,' he said.
'To die during this time is better than to be injured, because your treatment is going to be delayed hugely,' he added.
'Dying is more merciful.'

US forces repel Middle East attacks as Israel-Hamas war threatens spillover

October 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
United States forces are facing increased threats, raising concerns that the Israel-Hamas war may spill over across the region.
Drones and missiles were launched at bases hosting US troops in Iraq on Thursday. The attacks helped put Washington on heightened alert for activity by Iran-backed armed groups following similar incidents in Iraq and Syria on Wednesday, while a US warship intercepted missiles potentially heading towards Israel.
President Joe Biden has sent naval power to the Middle East in the past two weeks, including two aircraft carriers, other warships and about 2,000 marines.
There has been an uptick in attacks on US forces since the conflict in Israel broke out on October 7 when Palestinian fighters from Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza, attacked southern Israel.
Earlier this week, US forces thwarted multiple drones targeting troops.
On Wednesday, a drone hit US forces in Syria resulting in minor injuries, while another was brought down.
During a false alarm at Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq, a civilian contractor died from cardiac arrest.
However, on Thursday, drones and rockets targeted the base, which hosts US and other international forces in western Iraq. Multiple blasts were heard inside the base.
Rockets also hit a military base hosting US forces near Baghdad's international airport, Iraqi police said, without providing further details.
"While I'm not going to forecast any potential responses to these attacks, I will say that we will take all necessary actions to defend US and coalition forces against any threat," Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Patrick Ryder told reporters.
"Any response, should one occur, will come at a time in a manner of our choosing," Ryder said.
Drones intercepted
A US Navy warship travelling near Yemen intercepted three missiles above the northern Red Sea and several drones that were launched by what Ryder said was the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. The official said it appeared that the projectiles were potentially heading in the direction of Israel.
"We cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen, heading north along the Red Sea, potentially towards targets in Israel," the Pentagon spokesperson told reporters in a press briefing.
Ryder claimed he did not see a link between the rise in attacks and the conflict between Israel and Hamas.
"At this point, again, the information that we have does not show a direct connection to the Hamas attacks on October 7," he said.
On Wednesday, Iran-allied groups in Iraq announced that they had formed a 'joint operations room' to help Hamas in its war effort.
Two officials with Iranian-backed armed groups in Iraq, who spoke to the AP news agency on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly about the issue, confirmed the attacks on the two US bases on Wednesday.
They said the groups were on alert and prepared to join the wider battle against Israel, but that Iran had not yet given approval for them to open a new front.
Leaders from some of the factions are now in Lebanon and Syria in case they get orders to proceed, one of the officials told AP.
'Terrible brutality'
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iranian-backed fighters, has issued a statement claiming responsibility for the two drone attacks in Iraq and saying it 'heralds more operations' against the 'American occupation'.
The United States has 2,500 troops in Iraq, and 900 more in neighbouring Syria, on a mission to advise and assist local forces in fighting the ISIL (ISIS) armed group, which in 2014 seized swaths of territory in both countries.
In past years, Iranian-backed fighters regularly targeted US forces and the US embassy in Baghdad with rockets. Such attacks had abated under a truce in place since last year, and Iraq has had a period of relative calm.
But the war in Gaza has revived tensions. The country's top Shia Muslim leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, last week condemned Israel and called on the world to stand up to the "terrible brutality" in besieged Gaza.
Kataib Hezbollah, a powerful armed faction with close ties to Iran, accused the US of supporting Israel in "killing innocent people" and said it should leave Iraq.
Spillover feared
The increased tension has provoked warnings from officials across the lines of the risk of a spillover of the conflict to the wider region.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov   on Thursday of the potential for a regional crisis, saying efforts to pin blame on Iran were adding fuel to the fire.
The same day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen labelled the risk of regional spillover from the Israel-Hamas war as "real".
Underscoring the need to tighten sanctions on Iran, which she said was supplying Hamas, von der Leyen also said dialogue between Israel and its neighbours must continue.
"We have seen the Arab streets fill with rage all across the region. So the risk of a regional spillover is real," she said.
"Iran, Hamas's patron, only wants to fuel the fire of chaos. Russia, Iran's wartime customer, is watching carefully. Russia and Hamas are alike," the EU leader said.
Von der Leyen decried the "evil role that Iran plays in the background", adding that it was "without question" that Iran supplied 93 percent of the weapons being used by Hamas.
She said it was vital to continue sanctioning Iran, as well as to widen sanctions and crackdown on sanctions evasion.
"That we have to step up is without question," she said.
Earlier this week, the United Nations Middle East peace envoy warned the Security Council that the risk of expansion of the conflict between Israel and Hamas was "very real, and extremely dangerous".
"I fear that we are at the brink of a deep and dangerous abyss that could change the trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if not of the Middle East as a whole," said Tor Wennesland, addressing the 15-member body via video from Doha, Qatar.

Lebanon's army said it has fired tear gas at Israeli forces over the border in response to smoke bombs fired at its troops, though Israel has said Lebanon started the confrontation.
Tensions have flared along the  , with rockets fired at Israel during flare-ups of Israeli-Palestinian violence and members of the heavily armed Lebanese group Hezbollah or its supporters facing off with Israeli forces.
"Elements of the Israeli enemy violated the withdrawal line and fired smoke bombs at a Lebanese army patrol that was accompanying a bulldozer removing an earthen berm erected by the Israeli enemy north of the withdrawal line, the blue line, in the Bastra area," the Lebanese army said in a statement on Saturday.
The area where the incident occurred is in Chebaa Farms and the Kfar Chouba hills, which were captured by Israel from Syria during the 1967 Middle East war and are part of   that Israel annexed in 1981.
That unilateral annexation was not recognised internationally, except by the administration of former US president Donald Trump, and Syria demands the return of the territory. The Lebanese government has said the area belongs to Lebanon.
The Israeli military said it was Lebanon that started the violence.
"A short while ago, [Israeli] soldiers spotted an engineering vehicle's shovel crossing the Blue Line from Lebanon into Israeli territory in the area of Mount Dov," a statement from the Israeli military said. "In response, [Israeli] soldiers used riot dispersal means."
"The vehicle returned to Lebanese territory," the military said.
Border tensions
The Lebanon-Israel border has been relatively calm since Israel and Hezbollah fought a 34-day war in 2006. Despite that, there have been tensions.
In April, Israel   in southern Lebanon after fighters fired nearly three dozen rockets from Lebanon at Israel, wounding two people and causing property damage.
In July, Israeli forces shelled a southern Lebanese border village after several explosions were heard in a disputed area where the borders of Syria, Lebanon and Israel meet.

'Terror' amid Israel's raid on Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital

Israel's raid on Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital has brought "terror and death" to the thousands trapped inside, witnesses say.
The Israeli military has acted brutally during its assault on Wednesday, visiting violence and humiliation on patients, staff and displaced people, those inside Gaza's largest hospital told Al Jazeera.
Thousands have been caught in al-Shifa for days as Israeli forces have focused attacks on the area around the complex, which it has asserted harbours a Hamas base. Reports say food and water have been scarce while decomposing corpses have been accumulating.
Omar Zaqout, an emergency room employee at al-Shifa, said that Israeli soldiers have "detained and brutally assaulted some of the men who were taking refuge at the hospital".
"Israeli forces took the detained men naked and blindfolded. [They] did not bring any aid or supplies, they only brought terror and death," he said, adding that the army has surrounded every building within the hospital complex.
"More than 180 dead bodies are deteriorating and are still lying in the hospital's yard," he said. "The situation is very terrifying, gunshots are heard everywhere in the hospital's perimeters."
Ahmed El Mokhallalati, a surgeon, told Al Jazeera from inside the hospital that the occupying army brought tanks within the hospital after "continuous, aggressive gunshots, bombardments and attacks since yesterday evening".
"It's a totally scary time; it's a horrible time for the families, the civilians sheltering in the hospital with their kids. It's terrible for the staff who are taking care of their patients and the patients themselves," he said.
"Imagine being in a hospital where the water is not there, the basic hygiene of the people going to the toilet is a challenge. Food and drinking water haven't come to the hospital for the sixth day now, with no way of getting anything in the hospital," El Mokhallalati added.
He also said that the oxygen station was not working, and in general the staff was not able to care for their patients.
The surgeon expressed shock that "the whole world has been witnessing this crime and seeing everything that is happening and no one has stopped it. No one has said loudly this is not allowed."
"Where is the international community? Where is the international organisation which is made to help and support the health system in the war areas to make sure that humanitarian needs are met in the war areas in war times?" he asked.
"We are all within the building now. We can't even check through the window what's outside, we can't get anything to eat or drink, we can't get anything to our patients, and we can't move between the building at all," he said.
The raid on the Palestinian enclave's largest medical facility came after five days of attacks.
It has become the centre of Israel's war in Gaza as the occupying forces, along with the United States, claim that Hamas, the group that rules the territory, hides a military command centre underneath it.
Hamas and the medical staff inside al-Shifa have been rejecting the allegations as a "big lie".
Israel has killed more than 11,300 people in Gaza in the war that started on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel. Israel says the Hamas attack killed at least 1,200 people.

Food, toys and therapy: Tel Aviv residents help survivors of Hamas attack

Tel Aviv, Israel — City streets that just a week ago were lively are now eerily quiet. Though some residents have started  , many are fearful of leaving their homes since Hamas's surprise attack last Saturday.
Yet amid that tension, Israel's largest city has become a sanctuary for citizens and foreign workers who have fled the country's south, which was the target of Hamas fighters.
Many of the city's nearly 500,000 residents are now joining volunteer efforts to support survivors of Saturday's attack and people mostly who have come from areas close to the Gaza Strip with donations of food, clothing and other services.
These initiatives are picking up steam even as Israel prepares for a land assault on the Gaza Strip, after bombing the blockaded coastal territory with 6,000 missiles in six days.
At least 1,300 people in Israel were killed in the   attacks, while Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 1,799 Palestinians. At least 46 Palestinians have been killed in the Occupied West Bank.
Before October 7, Tel Aviv was a city bitterly divided over a range of domestic   and social issues. For now, that's the past. Residents are uniting tocare for one another.
At a hotel in Tel Aviv, a ballroom is converted into a play area for children and families who fled southern Israel [Eliyahu Freedman/Al Jazeera]
A hotel turned volunteer hub
On the Tel Aviv beachfront, people arrive in cars to drop off donations at the luxury Herods hotel for those who have sought refuge in the city. Many are now being housed at the hotel.
Yael, a psychologist who works for the Tel Aviv-Jaffa municipality and only wanted to give her first name, sat on Wednesday in the hotel basement outside a ballroom repurposed as a play area for children.
She had been assigned to help people affected by Saturday's traumatic events, including those who survived attacks by Hamas on a   and   (communal settlements in Hebrew).
"A lot of the people [seeking refuge in the hotel] feel like they were the ones who were rescued and blame themselves," said Yael, referring to the survivor's guilt she has observed among many.
Yael has also been shaken by the events. 'I know it's different but it feels like a Holocaust,' she said. 'We don't feel safe in our own country because something like this has never happened people lost their faith in the army and the country.'
The downtown hotel, with its lobby facing the sea, has become a 'central hub for people to donate services' from 'psychiatry sessions to haircuts', said hotel staff member Dean Sacks, 30, who was wearing the establishment's white slacks and blue shirt uniform.
He estimated that 'between 50-100 volunteers' donating various services are working around the building and that there are 'more [social workers] than I have been able to count.'
Inside several conference rooms and the ballroom are hundreds of sandwiches, snacks, children's games, clothes and other resources donated to the families, many of whom left their homes in a panicked rush without packing their belongings.
Around lunchtime on Wednesday, the hotel lobby was busy with many parents and young children walking in and out towards an area for donated food set up outside the hotel entrance with several Tel Aviv restaurants providing free meals.
'It's been so moving that it is literally heartbreaking to see how much the people of Tel Aviv care,' said Sacks.
Much to the delight of the children, Israeli television personalities, musicians and professional footballers have been amongst the visitors coming to bring cheer to the hotel play area.
Outside on the public beach, an incoming rocket siren, which sounds a few times a day, was followed by a beachside announcement warning people to seek shelter. While some heeded the warning, an informal football game between some displaced children continued.
One mother watching over her young children playing remarked that it was better to let them continue to play to take their minds off the trauma of abruptly leaving their home in Ashkelon, a coastal city just north of Gaza.
'All of these people don't know if their homes will be there when they get back," Dean said of the new guests. "These are the lucky ones."

'We just want to help'
Just a few kilometres down the road from the hotel in the trendy neighbourhood of Florentin, 41-year-old Thai restaurant owner Tippy Kongkaew, who has lived in Israel for five years, has been organising to support Thai workers affected by Saturday's violence.
Twenty-one   are feared dead while 14 are believed to have been taken captive by Hamas.
Tippy was opening her restaurant for the day. Her busy eatery has stayed open unlike others in the neighbourhood and has also been turned into a drop-off point for donated goods such as clothing, toiletries and knapsacks.
'We just want to help in our individual simplest way,' said Tippy, whose restaurant is also providing some free meals to displaced Thai workers staying down the road.
'Yesterday we sent a lot of goods to Kfar Yehoshua and today we are trying to collect more to send to Kadima,' she adds, referring to two small communities located north of Tel Aviv housing Thai nationals.
'There is a huge open warehouse full of mats on the floor,' said Zoe Biehl, a 30-year-old Israeli volunteer driving supplies to the communities and part of a WhatsApp group helping Thai workers around the country.
Outside the restaurant, 37-year-old Uoy, who only wanted to give his first name, was sitting on a bench. Uoy, who is Thai, was an agricultural worker in Be'eri, a small kibbutz where the bodies of more than 100 people were found.
'I heard gunfire on Saturday morning,' recounted Uoy in Thai, speaking via a translator and gesturing with his hands, 'and saw a battle going on in our camp [where he slept] none were wounded but in other camps in Be'eri there were [fatalities].'
For now, Uoy said he just wants to return home to Thailand. Maybe, after the war, "[I] will come back," he said.

The Israeli military released a   on Sunday saying it had found a Hamas tunnel shaft under Gaza's  . It also released footage of tunnels taken on November 17. Here is what the footage tells us:
What happened at al-Shifa?
On November 15, Israel launched an aggressive   on Gaza's largest medical complex, al-Shifa Hospital. Lasting for days, the raid was described by Israel as a 'precise and targeted' operation to find an alleged underground tunnel system that led to a Hamas military control centre.
The allegation that Hamas was operating a control centre under the hospital was backed by Israeli and  . Hamas and medical staff at al-Shifa have denied this allegation.
The Israeli military also released a 3D animated video  on October 28, visualising an extensive network of tunnels that led to an elaborate, multi-storey control centre.
(Al Jazeera)
What Israel's new tunnel video tells us
On Sunday, Israel   that a 55-metre-long (180ft), 10-metre-deep (32ft) tunnel was found under the hospital.
The statement said that the tunnel was found 'in the area of the hospital underneath a shed alongside a vehicle containing numerous weapons including RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades], explosives, and Kalashnikov rifles'.
The Israeli military also released a video that was recorded using two separate cameras on November 17. Spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters the entrance was uncovered when a military bulldozer knocked down the outside wall of the hospital, revealing a metallic spiral staircase that descended 10m (32ft) and led to a blast door, which is typically a metallic door with strong closures and hinges, designed to resist explosions. Such doors are usually found on facilities such as bomb shelters.
But military analyst Zoran Kusovac quoted a civil engineer from Gaza who suggested that the video is actually clips of two different tunnels spliced together.
The first section of the video shows the vertical shaft that goes down. It shows features such as load-bearing concrete columns. They seem to be built with regular civil engineering techniques, which would have requiredlarge and loud machines such as concrete mixers.
Such a construction could not have been done in secret, the way Hamas tunnels are usually built. The purpose of this construction remains unknown.
The second part of the clip shows the horizontal tunnel. This displays features characteristic of Hamas tunnels — pre-fabricated pieces connected together section by section.
Was a Hamas control centre found under Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital?
A control centre has not been found so far. Israeli troops have not yet tried to open the blast door at the end of the tunnel that they claim was under al-Shifa, fearing it could be booby-trapped, said Hagari.
Kusovac said that many different types of traps can be placed to prevent tunnel interceptions. Typically, they are improvised explosive devices (IEDs) connected with detonators that can be triggered by tripwire or even light or pressure. They detect the presence of a person entering the tunnel, setting off the explosive. "IEDs are basically like toys the big boys make. The more creative you are, the more successful you are," said Kusovac.
If armies suspect the presence of such traps, typical regulations are to call explosion experts who arrive and assess the situation. Kusovac said that this usually takes a few hours, not over a day. This time delay brings the veracity of the Israeli military's claims into question. "You say smoking gun, you get to it and then you don't show the smoking gun," he said.
CNN, among other news outlets, visited the exposed tunnel shaft and confirmed the presence of a tunnel, but could not establish whether or not the tunnel led to a command centre.
Does Hamas operate underground tunnels?
Tunnels in Gaza were   in 1980 at a time when the enclave was under Israeli occupation, and before the formation of Hamas in  . They were constructed under the Egyptian border for smuggling all sorts of goods, including weapons, fuel and black market goods.
Over time, Palestinians realised that tunnels could have a military use. The   of the military use of tunnels was in 2001 when an Israeli military post was blown up with an explosive from underground. The tunnels entered Israeli public consciousness when Palestinian fighters emerged from a tunnel shaft and kidnapped Israeli soldier   in 2006.
Israel placed a blockade on the Gaza Strip after Hamas gained control of it in 2007. Tunnels became the means to bypass the siege and to transport food, goods and weapons. Under Hamas, the tunnels expanded strategically.
The tunnels are also used by Hamas for wired communications, since Israel can intercept wireless communications.
After attacking Gaza in 2014, Israel realised the extent and sophistication of the tunnels, then believed to have surpassed 100km (62 miles).
A   would entail a whole lot of destruction. The magnitude of explosives would be   and deadlier than usual due to the smaller area of the tunnels. For the same reason, the use of regular ammunition might be too 'clumsy' and hence unviable.
Al-Shifa is not the only hospital that Israel has alleged is used by Hamas as a military base. On November 8, Al Jazeera's verification unit Sanad   Israel's claim that there was a Hamas tunnel under the Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Hospital for Rehabilitation and Prosthetics, commonly known as the Qatari Hospital.
Satellite images and archival photos showed that the hatch that Israel claimed was the tunnel entrance was actually part of a water reservoir system that was used to fill therapeutic pools for amputees, water the grounds, and also was an emergency water source.

Analysis: Israel's ground attacks yield lots of bang, little success

A strong combined-arms attack on Gaza that started on Friday night continued on Saturday, but it is still unclear whether this is the first step in the big push that Israel has been announcing or is it just another probe to test Palestinian resistance.
The Israeli military launched two limited-scope ground attacks on Wednesday and Thursday night,   to exploit them for propaganda. On both occasions, they pulled back to Israel before dawn.
The still-ongoing attack seems not to be the "'Big One". But as an obvious extension of the previous two incursions into Gaza, it may be a precursor to an all-out offensive.
Saturday's reports from Gaza may be the last made over mobile networks and land-based internet. Israeli forces hit public telecom infrastructure and Gaza is now under an almost  . The only means to get information out to the world are the few remaining satellite telephones, but those could be targeted at any time.
Israeli Air Force dedicated electronic warfare aircraft can pinpoint every device exchanging data with low-orbit communication satellites and direct deadly air-to-ground missiles against it.
The technique is hardly new: It was first used by the Russians in 1996 to assassinate Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudaev as he was using a satellite phone. Israelis have a long record of targeted killings using phones to identify and locate the target. One of the first victims of the technique was Hamas leader  , killed the same year as Dudaev.
However, the destruction of communication nodes and the use of electronic countermeasures to block any remaining public lines that survived will not harm Hamas fighters who, knowing Israeli tactics and capabilities, appear to have prepared for this course of action.
Palestinian sources claim that Hamas installed 'Israel-proof' communications infrastructure in its extensive network of tunnels under the Gaza Strip. It allegedly laid tens of kilometres of cables with strong electromagnetic shielding to prevent the detection and interception of signals.
Installed in the most modern tunnels, set in much deeper, they are almost fully secure from prying Israelis. The cables emit a minimum amount of electromagnetic radiation, and the great depth practically prevents detection and signal interception. These new, secure, means of communications may explain how Hamas managed to keep its plans for the October 7 attack secret.
On Saturday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant admitted that his forces were specifically targeting the tunnels. Israel claimed it hit more than 150 underground targets, but this claim must be taken with a pinch of salt. Buildings hiding tunnel entrances, maybe; 150 tunnels, unlikely.
Since Hamas first embarked on underground warfare, its tunnels have grown from primitive makeshift dugouts couple of metres deep to sophisticated, well-engineered, concrete-clad structures that reportedly stand as deep as 20 metres (66 feet) under the surface.
The reasons for going so deep — a feat that requires considerable engineering effort and use of manpower — is to pass under Israeli border barriers, including tall concrete walls that extend as deep as eight metres (26 feet) under the surface. Digging deep gives Hamas the additional advantage of their tunnels becoming fairly immune to Israeli bombing.
Ordinary iron bombs, free-fall or laser-guided, penetrate poorly. Anything deeper than one meter (3 feet) is relatively safe. To destroy targets hidden further underground, special ammunitions are needed. Rocket-accelerated bombs, originally developed to penetrate the thick and strong concrete of airport runways and explode in the soft ground under it, raising the paved surface and making it unusable for aircraft, can be used against tunnels and underground bunkers. But in Gaza, their efficacy is questionable as tunnels are rarely dug under open soil that these boosted bombs can penetrate.
Having gone through so many bombardments, Hamas took good care to locate its subterranean facilities under surface structures. Its tunnels probably extend under the buildings wherever possible.
This affords the tunnels the protection of several concrete floor slabs that even bigger ordnance has difficulty penetrating. Bombs and rockets normally explode when they hit a hard obstacle, penetrating the first concrete floor but lacking the power to go through the subsequent ones.
This is overcome by tandem warheads, where the first charge explodes as the projectiles hit the topmost slab, the next blasting through the one immediately below it. Most such warheads are designed to take out two lawyers, a few might be able to take three. But none can blast its way through three or four floors. If the structures are hit by conventional explosions beforehand and turn into loose layers of rubble, the task becomes even more challenging. Rubble favours defenders rather than attackers.
Special dedicated '  ' exist, designed to take the biggest and hardest underground bunkers, but they are certainly not going to be a game changer in this conflict. Such deep penetrators were designed to defeat the enormous concrete ceilings of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's bunkers. But they would be a very impractical and prohibitively expensive solution because, despite Israeli superior technology, it still would have a very slim chance of accurately detecting the deep Hamas tunnels. Wasting thousands of bombs worth millions each simply could not be sustained.
The United States ended up not using these super-penetrators for the invasion in Iraq. Israel bought an undisclosed number of GBU-28 2,100kg (220-pound) specialised deep-digging bombs, but I would be surprised if these could make a strategic difference as the conditions for their use are far from ideal. Iraq probably had several dozens of main command bunkers whose locations were generally known while Hamas has more smaller facilities, most well-hidden under buildings.
We have to see how the latest escalation will develop, whether it will lead to an invasion along multiple lines using at least 30,000 ground troops or if it will quiet down.
To sum up the last four days of attacks: Nothing that Israel has shown so far could grow into a major strategic initiative to win the war on the ground. Its next steps will show how well it learns from its — and Hamas's — performance.

In Tunisia, pro-Palestinian fervour used to push for anti-NGO law

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Tunis, Tunisia – The war on Gaza has granted Tunisia a rare moment of political unity, fuelling public appetite for new legislation that risks fracturing civil society groups and potentially isolating the country on the international stage.
Since his July 2021 power grab, decried by the opposition as a coup, President Kais Saied has faced simmering discontent from both supporters of the former parliament and a powerful trade union, the Union Generale Tunisienne du Travail, or Tunisian General Labour Union.
For much of Tunisia's predominantly young and progressive civil society groups, Saied's presidency has provided a focal point of dissent, but many are divided between resentment of his authoritarian rule and what most see as an absence of any alternative.
However, Israel's relentless bombing of the Gaza Strip in retaliation for an October 7 surprise attack by the military wing of Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, has tugged at deep historical threads within Tunisia,   in a way that nothing else has, including the 2011 revolution.
Piggybacking on public sentiment?
The deep public anger against Israel and its Western backers, who seem unwilling to even ask it for restraint, have given new momentum to existing proposals to curtail the work of all of the country's NGOs. They are being seen as a legislative curb on Western influence.
The proposals, put forward by a group of members of parliament, would rewrite the post-revolutionary Decree 88, hailed at the time as among the world's best legislation for free association, and could serve as a leash to pull all of country's NGOs back.

The proposed curbs date back to objections by Fatma Mseddi, a lawmaker from Sfax on the Mediterranean coast, over the support offered by civil society groups to undocumented Black refugees sleeping rough on the streets of her city. She wanted the refugees deported and the NGOs helping them blocked from receiving overseas funding.
The legislation would affect all NGOs operating within Tunisia. Public resentment of Western governments support for Israel –   on democracy building and human rights – has left many of the Tunisian NGOs that they have helped fund exposed to criticism.
"I support the president," 33-year-old Khadija Malki, who works at a nearby factory, said from a cafe in Tunis's medina. Of the NGO bill, she said her distrust of Western influence had grown since the attacks on Gaza, telling a translator: "There are so many associations, but it is easier to side with Tunisian ones over foreign ones."
Electrical engineer Yousseff Jeziri felt the same: "I don't believe in these associations anyway. They're just names. I think their presence here is suspicious."
A measure of the Tunisian public mood can also be gauged by support for a bill that would  . Until the president's intervention on Friday, the bill threatened prison terms for anyone communicating or dealing with any individual or entity from Israel, which would have effectively criminalised members of Tunisia's Jewish community, many of whose family members carry Israeli passports.
Allowing the state to control NGOs
According to many NGOs in Tunisia, the legislation would essentially demolish the country's reputation as a development hub. That reputation is already being tested by the actions of the country's hardline president.
The central thrust of the proposed law focuses on permissions for NGOs to set themselves up. Instead of a simple notification process, the new system would in effect give the government the right to decide which NGOs operate in the country and, by extension, how they operate and for how long.
Since 2011, international organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have established offices in Tunisia. A burgeoning domestic NGO community, like parliamentary watchdog Al Bawsala and the anti-corruption NGO IWatch, has grown, all of whom compete for international grants to maintain their funding.
Organisations serving victims of domestic violence, arranging legal representation for those accused of criminal activity or representing sexual minorities have all grown in number since the revolution.
According to many NGOs, should the new legislation pass, their activities will be under the control of the state.
"This legislation is badly written, and badly written legislation is dangerous," Amine Kharrat of Al Bawsala said of the proposed revisions to the NGO law. "Moreover, the country's anti-Western sentiment is allowing President Saied to steer through legislation without any real oversight."
President Kais Saied [File: Johanna Geron/Pool/Reuters]
In February 2022, Saied characterised civil society organisations registered overseas or receiving foreign funding as "extensions of foreign powers, which seek to control the Tunisian people through their money".
"The MPs want something fast. They want to show their support for Palestine, which is laudable," said Salsabil Chellali, the Tunisia director at Human Rights Watch. "But it shouldn't be done by passing a dangerous law."
Tunisia's increasingly   comes at a time of heightened international tension. It also places the country at odds with the policy aims of Tunisia's largest single international donor, the United States, which continues to push for Arab states to normalise relations with Israel.
"The president knows exactly how this will be seen," political analyst Amine Snoussi said.
"It will impact his negotiations with the IMF [whose majority shareholder is the US] while denting his image among Europe's far right, who love both Israel and Saied and who he needs to work with over migration."

'Anti-Semitism has no place in Germany': Scholz condemns synagogue attack

October 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has denounced a fire-bomb attack on a Berlin synagogue, stating that the country 'stands united for the protection of Jews', despite signs of increasing anti-Semitism.
Molotov cocktails were hurled at a synagogue belonging to the Kahal Adass Jisroel Jewish community in the centre of Berlin on Wednesday. Scholz insisted that Germany would 'never accept' such attacks, as police noted that anti-Semitism is on the rise.
The bottles filled with flammable liquid, which were thrown by two masked men, hit the pavement in front of the synagogue without damaging the building. The perpetrators are not reported to have been caught.
While police were investigating the attack, they also arrested another man who approached the scene yelling anti-Israel slogans.
Rabbi Shlomo Afanasev from the Kahal Adass Jisroel community said it was the first time he had felt unsafe in Germany, and that he was now concerned about appearing 'openly Jewish'.
'I go to the synagogue since 2006, and … I always go with my kippah on,' he said, referring to the skullcap traditionally worn by Jewish males. "We felt until today very safe here. And never thought something like this could happen in this area. In the middle of Berlin.'
'Outraged'
German Chancellor Scholz, who is on a visit to Egypt to support mediation over the crisis in Gaza, said he was 'outraged' by the incident and pledged to bolster security for Jewish institutions.
Anschlge gegen jüdische Einrichtungen, gewaltttige Ausschreitungen auf unseren Straen - das ist menschenverachtend, abscheulich und nicht zu dulden. Antisemitismus hat in Deutschland keinen Platz. Mein Dank geht besonders in dieser Situation an die Sicherheitskrfte.
- Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (@Bundeskanzler) October 18, 2023
In a post on the social media platform X, he added: "Attacks against Jewish institutions, violent riots on our streets - this is inhumane, disgusting and cannot be tolerated. Anti-Semitism has no place in Germany. My thanks go to the security forces, especially in this situation."
A number of German nationals were killed during Hamas's  . That has helped to escalate tensions in the country as the 
Clashes at pro-Palestinian events in Berlin's Neukoelln and Kreuzberg neighbourhoods, as well as at the landmark Brandenburg Gate, resulted in the injury of several police officers on Tuesday night.
Scholz has sought an active diplomatic role in the Gaza crisis, travelling to Israel, and then to Egypt to meet with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
The German chancellor has been outspoken in calling for humanitarian aid to Gaza and for an investigation to be launched into the "horrific"   that killed some 500 civilians in a Gaza hospital on Tuesday night.
'I am horrified by the images of the explosion in a hospital in Gaza. Innocent civilians were injured and killed. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims, he wrote on the social media platform X. 'A thorough investigation of the incident is imperative.'

Analysis: It's a win-win for Hezbollah against Israel so far

As Israeli advances into Gaza continue, they — for the first time — appear to be coming from more than one direction. It is yet unclear whether these are still reconnaissances-in-force or if Israel chose to make the ground invasion a 'rolling operation' increasing force levels gradually over time.
For Israel's military, such a careful approach may prove more practical than an all-out offensive. If tactics are adapted daily to the situation on the ground, the successful ones can be replicated elsewhere. From a political perspective, it buys generals time to see how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's position develops.
In past conflicts, most Israelis braced together, avoiding questioning their government too much. Now, many accuse Netanyahu of being responsible for the October 7 attacks. He has adamantly retorted that 'this is a time for war.'
But while he was almost certainly referring to the Israeli southern front in Gaza, his intransigence may see the opening of another one, in the north.
On Monday, I suggested that regional countries do not want to join in. However, states are not the only entities that have armies. In Israel's northern neighbour,  , one such non-state military, Hezbollah, is stronger than the national army. And not under the control of the central government.
Hezbollah, meaning Party of God, was created in the 1980s, during the civil war in Lebanon, to unite various factions of minority Shia Muslims and provide social services as the state had disintegrated. Encouraged by initial success and by the backing of Iran, Hezbollah developed an armed wing that quickly became a formidable fighting force.
So formidable that it can be said to be the only Arab force ever to defeat Israel in battle. In 2000,   forced Israel to end its occupation of South Lebanon.
Israelis angrily refuse to call their withdrawal after a stay of 15 years a defeat, but they admit that Hezbollah was a major factor in their decision. In 2006, in a one-month war with Israel, Hezbollah showed an unprecedented and unexpected degree of sophistication and capability when it attacked Israeli corvette Hanit, then one of the three most modern and capable ships, with a Chinese-built land-sea missile.
Hassan Nasrallah, overall leader of Hezbollah, has boasted of 100,000 fighters under his command. He is likely exaggerating: Most experts believe the figure to be approximately 60,000 but pure numbers are not the militia's main asset.
Its strengths lie in proper military organisation and discipline and dedication that is without doubt superior to most state armies. It also has an arsenal of weapons well suited to the infiltration-capable small-team light-infantry tactics that it learned by fighting Israel. Due to its enemy's superiority in air force and armour, Hezbollah has no piloted aircraft nor tanks, although it operated a battalion-size armoured unit in the Syrian war, to gain experience.
But it has a potent array of missiles and rockets, heavier and longer ranged than those that Hamas uses, and capable field artillery. Most weapons are believed to have been originally supplied by and through Iran. They were supplemented in range and numbers in the Syrian war where Hezbollah aided official Syrian forces of President Bashar al-Assad.
The dedication and determination of Hezbollah fighters resisting   caused Israel to formulate the much-criticised 'Dahya doctrine' of total aerial destruction that we are now seeing every day in Gaza. It was named after the Beirut neighbourhood that first met that fate. Israeli General Gadi Eizenkot explained it as a plan to harm the civilians as the only way of stopping the fighters, by using disproportionate power against any civilian structure that they could use. It failed to stop Hezbollah.
Being an enemy it knows and respects, Hezbollah compelled Israel to deploy massive reinforcements on the Lebanon border, boosting the resident Golani brigade to probably 100,000 soldiers or more. It knows that, unlike Hamas – which can only launch rockets, Hezbollah has a realistic possibility of advancing into Israel and holding ground taken.
But Hezbollah does not need to attack across the Blue Line demarcating the two countries. By its very existence, it is what militaries call an "army-in-waiting". Israel must keep its assets in the north to counter, and deter, any potential big push that would be a serious military, and even bigger political, problem for Israel.
The current situation and most possible developments seem to favour Hezbollah. If it just maintains the current low-level engagement, it blocks significant Israeli military assets.
It can choose to respond to the continued destruction of Gaza by launching a relatively moderate series of rocket attacks against Israel without significant risk of provoking an Israeli offensive into Lebanon. Coordinated missile attacks against targets that Hamas can reach, say in Tel Aviv, would put the Iron Dome defences under enormous strain. And Hezbollah could also bombard Hamas-safe cities in the north like Haifa or Kiryat Shmona.
Such modest levels of escalation would win Hamas popularity in the Arab and Muslim world as the only non-Palestinian force joining the Gaza Palestinians' fight.
Yet, all of this is only valid if events on the ground follow some rationale. But rational behaviour is fragile and of limited use in situations ruled by fear, frustrations, hatred or other strong collective emotions.
The current tense-but-stable very-low-intensity standoff at Israel's northern border appears to be the most convenient situation for both sides, and they both know it. But both must be worried about the possibility that a small unpredictable flash ignites a big fire that neither side can contain.

At Gaza's Indonesia Hospital, medics fight to save lives amid Israel raids

October 30th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Medan, Indonesia – An Indonesian-funded hospital in Gaza is struggling to treat a deluge of patients wounded in Israeli bombardment amid dwindling medicine stocks and blackouts that have forced doctors to operate in darkness, a volunteer organisation has said.
Fikri Rofiul Haq, a volunteer for the Indonesia-based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee (MER-C), which organised donations to build the hospital in 2011, told Al Jazeera that Indonesia Hospital has been inundated with patients after weeks of relentless bombing by Israeli forces.
'At the Indonesia Hospital alone, 870 people have died and 2,530 people have been treated for injuries. Some 164 patients are still hospitalised," Haq told Al Jazeera.
'Around half the population of Gaza has evacuated to places people think are safer than their homes, like schools and hospitals, including the Indonesia Hospital. More than 1,500 residents have fled to the Indonesia Hospital and are camping in empty rooms and the hospital courtyards.'
Last week, the hospital lost power due to a blackout caused by a lack of fuel as Israel's blockade of the enclave prevented the entry of essential supplies.
'We are trying to find fuel to power the Indonesia Hospital following the blackout, which lasted for over an hour. Doctors had no choice but to perform operations and treat patients without any light,' Haq said.
'The Indonesia Hospital really needs medical assistance and hospital personnel are exhausted because they are being forced to work 24 hours a day.'
Haq said getting aid to the hospital had been a challenge, but the MER-C had elicited donations from Indonesians and other aid organisations in Gaza and volunteers had been able to deliver some supplies to the hospital on October 19 and October 24.
'We were able to get some medicine and other medical equipment, but there is still a lot of medicine we do not have in stock because it has run out,' he said.
Humanitarian mission
There are 45 Indonesians currently based in Palestine – 10 in Gaza and 35 in the occupied West Bank – according to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
There also are some 230 Indonesians based in Israel, many of whom are there for religious tourism.
The Indonesia Hospital is located in Beit Lahia, a city of about 90,000 people in northern Gaza, and sits on some 16,000 square metres (19,136 square yards) of land donated by the government of Gaza in 2011.
The hospital cost almost $8m to build and was funded by donations from Indonesian citizens in conjunction with organisations including the Indonesian Red Cross Society and the Muhammadiyah Society, one of Indonesia's largest Muslim organisations.
MER-C – which describes its mission as helping the "most vulnerable people' regardless of background, religion, nationality, ethnicity, class, or criminal status – was founded by a group of University of Indonesia students who carried out medical procedures in Maluku in eastern Indonesia in 1999, during the sectarian conflict between Christian and Muslim communities.
Since its creation in 1999, MER-C has conducted humanitarian missions in conflict-hit countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Sudan, the Philippines and Thailand.
The organisation has provided medical assistance to some controversial patients, including  , the head of the al-Qaeda-linked group Jemaah Islamiyah, and a number of the preparators of the Bali bombings before they were executed in 2008.
The Indonesia Hospital has also received more than $63,000 in donations from the Islamic Defenders Front, which was banned in Indonesia in 2020, to establish a blood bank.
Indonesia's then-Vice President Jusuf Kalla officially inaugurated the hospital, which has about 100 beds, four operating theatres and an intensive care unit, in 2016.

On Friday, communications were cut across Gaza, leaving aid organisations including MER-C unable to contact their staff on the ground.
Rima Manzanaris, MER-C's Indonesia-based operational manager, said the escalating military bombardment of Gaza and patchy communications were extremely worrying, particularly following reports of heavy bombing near the hospital in recent days.
'We were unable to contact our three Indonesian Indonesian volunteers in Gaza from the afternoon of October 27 as all telephone and WhatsApp networks were down,' she told Al Jazeera.
Manzanaris said MER-C is currently preparing to send a team to Egypt to collect aid for distribution to the hospital.
'Since last week, the MER-C team in Gaza has been distributing aid provided by Indonesian nationals by searching for supplies within the Gaza Strip, including medicine, paramedic clothes, ready-to-eat food, winter equipment and fuel for generators at the Indonesia Hospital,' she said.
Communications in Gaza were restored on Sunday after nearly 36 hours of a near-total communications blackout.
Haq said Israeli shelling had already destroyed parts of the roof of the hospital, causing ceilings to collapse in a number of rooms.
'Two days ago, there was extremely heavy shelling by Israeli forces around the Indonesia Hospital, which started in the afternoon and did not stop all night. We just heard explosions going off continuously," Haq said. "The sounds of the explosions were deafening and some of the Israeli rockets landed in the area around the hospital.'
'The bombs caused the whole hospital to shake and we had to try and save ourselves by taking shelter in the basement,' he added.
Haq said he had received news that trucks bringing aid were en route from Egypt, but were being delayed by queues to enter Gaza.
'We hope that a ceasefire will be declared soon,' he said. 'Winter is coming and, if this war continues, refugees in the Gaza Strip will be in a very precarious position as they do not have enough mattresses, blankets and jackets.'

More than a month without water, food and healthcare in Gaza

November 7th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel's intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip, one of the world's most densely populated areas, has caused the deaths of 10,328 Palestinians, including 4,237 children, since the war started on October 7. More than 1,400 people have been killed in Israel in the same period.
The Ministry of Health in Gaza said the number of people wounded has increased to 25,965.
On October 9, the Israeli military announced a total blockade of the already besieged enclave, including a ban on water and food. Two days later, it cut off the power and restricted the entry of aid and fuel.
An estimated 1.5 million people have been displaced, their condition ever more precarious because of the  .
Severe water shortage
Rights groups have warned for years about the deteriorating water situation in the Gaza Strip. In 2021, the Global Institute for Water, Environment and Health and the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor described Gaza's water as  , with 97 percent of its water unfit for consumption.
Now, the lack of electricity means that desalination and wastewater treatment plants can't run, further compromising access to safe drinking water.
On November 4, Israel destroyed  a water reservoir in northern Gaza as well as a public water tank that supplied several neighbourhoods in the south.
Many people are drinking polluted, salty water and queue for hours in the hope of obtaining potable water.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says that between 50 and 100 litres of water per person per day are needed – but it has put the average daily allocation in Gaza at a mere three litres for all daily needs, including drinking and hygiene.
(Al Jazeera)
What is the impact of not drinking enough water?
A lack of water affects the body by first impacting the kidneys, and eventually the heart. Dehydration sets in fast for children and can often be deadly. A person can experience   as the heart has to pump faster to maintain oxygen.
Water makes up about 60 percent of the human body. Dehydration can kill an infant in a stressful environment within hours, and a healthy adult in two to four days.
(Al Jazeera)
Is there enough to eat?
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) says that 80 percent of the population in the Gaza Strip was already food insecure prior to the start of the attacks on October 7. Nearly half the population  of 2.3 million people relied on food assistance from the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).
Before October 7, about 500 trucks on average were allowed into Gaza each day.
According to the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), since October 21, at least 451 trucks have entered Gaza, of which158 carried food, including canned fish, pasta, wheat flour, canned tomato paste and canned beans; 102 carried health supplies; 44 had water or hygiene products; 32 ferried non-food items; and eight had nutrition supplies.
The remaining   carried mixed cargo. Fuel supplies are still not allowed to enter Gaza, which is seriously affecting the hospitals still functioning and risking the lives of thousands.
(Al Jazeera)
The World Food Programme (WFP) says   in Gaza are running out, with barely five days of supplies left. For every person who has received WFP food assistance, at least six more are in need.
The   that are still operational have to produce at six times their normal capacity, with residents waiting in line for 4-6 hours to get loaves of bread , and also leaving themselves vulnerable to Israeli attacks.
Only one of the bakeries contracted by WFP, and eight other bakeries in the southern and central areas, have been intermittently providing bread to shelters, depending on the availability of flour and fuel.
How does lack of nutrition harm a child?
Every human body needs a balanced diet enriched with vitamins to retain optimal function. In children, food deprivation can be felt quicker, as their growth and brain development hinge on the nutrition they are receiving.
According to the WHO , food deprivation or undernutrition in children results in the stunting of growth, wasting, and problems related to being underweight. Undernutrition prevents   from reaching their physical and cognitive potential and makes them much more vulnerable to disease and death.
Inadequate nutrition during   can also increase the risk of giving birth to a stunted infant.
(Al Jazeera)
Lack of access to healthcare
The WHO says that women and children are bearing the burden of the bombardment on Gaza's health facilities and the lack of supplies. Women are delivering babies wherever they can, unable to access healthcare facilities to deliver in a sanitary environment, and doctors are having to perform Caesarean sections without anesthesia.
At least 180 women are giving birth each day. Maternal and neonatal deaths have escalated due to the lack of critical care.
Overcrowded UNRWA shelters are reporting cases of acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea and chickenpox. With facilities exceeding capacity, people are now living on the streets. The WHO has reported at least 22,500 cases of acute respiratory infections and 12,000 cases of diarrhoea, which can be deadly in children suffering from dehydration and lack of food.
Doctors have had to use vinegar as disinfectants – and screws and sewing needles for surgeries.

  from   says the systems are collapsing and treatment in a sterile setting is limited: 'Flies are filling the hospital, you will see worms coming out of people's wounds.'
The   was forced to shutter due to the lack of fuel, and patients with critical needs like dialysis and infants needing intensive care equipment are severely affected.
Since November 3, the main power generators at al-Shifa Hospital and the Indonesian Hospital have stopped working. Israeli warplanes have continued to attack hospitals and the areas around them, where patients, health workers and hundreds fleeing the conflict have found shelter.

'Giving up is not an option': Volunteer doctors at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital

Deir el-Balah, Gaza – Abdelrahman Abu Shawish did not expect to be making life-altering decisions for his patients so soon after graduating from medical school at Gaza's Azhar University.
The 25-year-old, who lives with his family in the Nuseirat refugee camp, began volunteering in the surgical department of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital on October 10 and found himself deciding whether a wounded person requires a full or partial amputation of their limbs.
"The injuries that I saw in the [May] 2021 war more or less looked the same," he told Al Jazeera. "But this time around, I've seen so many different types, from varying degrees of burns to amputated limbs, to deep lacerations and different types of shrapnel."

The hospital, which was meant to serve the central town of Deir el-Balah, has become the Gaza Strip's main treatment facility due to the complete collapse of hospitals in Gaza City and northern Gaza.
Nearly two-thirds of the strip's hospitals – 26 out of 35 – have stopped functioning following weeks of bombardment by Israeli forces on the territory, which began on October 7. At least 1.5 million Palestinians have been displaced from their homes and the massive aerial and ground assault on Gaza has destroyed much of its infrastructure, including more than half the homes.
Furthermore, the total siege imposed by Israel on the enclave means hospitals have run out of fuel, electricity and clean water.
"We have very limited medical supplies," Abu Shawish said. "When dozens of wounded people come to the hospital as a result of an Israeli attack, we often can't treat them all at once because we need to sterilise our tools as we don't have enough."
The lack of resources means doctors can do little more than the minimum required to keep their patients alive. Proper treatment is out of the question.

"We're unable to remove all the shrapnel from a wounded person's body, only the pieces that threaten their lives," Abu Shawish explained. "That's still dangerous, as shrapnel can cause infections that lead to multiple organ failure, but we hope they can follow up once the war is over."
The young doctor, who had studied German in preparation for going to Germany for his residency, said he has had to downgrade his aspirations for his career.
"I had big dreams before the war but now I just hope for me and my family to stay alive," he said.
'No time for rest'
After his family home was destroyed in the Israeli shelling of the al-Zahra neighbourhood south of Gaza City, Mohammad Abu Salem began volunteering at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital on October 19 and has only seen his family twice since then.
Also just 25 years old, Abu Salem, who specialised in physiotherapy at the Islamic University in Gaza City, said Israeli massacres of Palestinians have become an everyday reality in the Gaza Strip.
"I knew working in a hospital in general would be hectic, but working in a hospital during a war is on a whole new different level," he said. "You don't know what is going to happen tomorrow, whether you will live or die. But giving up is not an option."
Mohammad Abu Salem, 25, volunteer at the physiotherapy department [Atia Darwish/Al Jazeera]
The physiotherapy department sees all patients after their initial treatment in the emergency room, after which they go on to other departments such as the surgical unit or paediatric wing. Abu Salem talks to patients about the nature of their wounds, the complications that might arise, and how to avoid such risks.
"The other day my own brother came in injured – thankfully it wasn't serious," he said. "But the stress of treating people you know… can be very debilitating."
Nearing total collapse
In the emergency room, Alaa Kassab points out patients whose limbs have turned blue, explaining that shrapnel has likely done so much damage that the limb isn't oxygenating and may need to be amputated.
Incidents like this, especially the large number of children she has seen lose limbs to amputation, have impacted her to the point where she is not able to speak sometimes.
Instead of talking to her family at home, she needs to sit in silence to recover most days.
Kassab finished her medical studies at the Ain Shams University in Cairo and returned to her hometown of Deir el-Balah last February.
"I had this dream of finishing my medical internship year, then travelling overseas to complete my studies by specialising, before eventually going back to Gaza," she said. "What I've seen in the past two weeks since volunteering has only made me more determined to be a doctor."
Alaa Kassab graduated from Ain Shams University in Cairo and returned to Gaza last February [Atia Darwish/Al Jazeera]
The hours are long and gruelling, and Kassab has never seen some of the wounds she is having to treat now.
"There isn't a day where we can rest," she said, adding that she works from noon until 3am the following day. "The number of wounded people never lets up. It's why I decided to volunteer, because I knew that doctors are under an immense amount of pressure and the situation is very tough."
Kassab said the hospital is nearing a total collapse of services. Without enough surgical tools, fuel, medical supplies or personnel, they will soon not be able to treat any more patients, she said.
"Of course, I am here to serve my people, and I don't regret that for a second," she said. "But the situation in the Gaza Strip is very bad."

China's Wang Yi to pay rare visit to US as two countries try to repair ties

October 24th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will travel to the United States later this week as part of an ongoing effort to repair the two countries' strained ties amid growing geopolitical crises.
Wang will visit Washington from October 26-28 and meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan, officials said, after Blinken and other top officials   in June.
The US is keen to ensure disagreements between Washington and Beijing do not veer into conflict and that they can work together on issues of mutual concern. Other US politicians have travelled to China since Blinken's visit, with California Governor Gavin Newsom currently in the country to discuss climate change.
"We continue to believe that direct face-to-face diplomacy is the best way to raise challenging issues, address misperception and miscommunication and explore working with the Chinese where our interests intersect," one official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, told the Reuters news agency.
The meetings are likely to cover a range of issues, including the  , the   and the escalating tensionin the South China Sea, senior administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press news agency.
Washington is sending military aid to Israel and Ukraine, while Beijing has grown closer to Russia since the Ukraine war began in February 2022, and has called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
A second official said the US would "push the Chinese to take a more constructive approach on both'.
Hopes for Xi-Biden meeting
Wang held   with the foreign ministers of Israel and the Palestinian Authority on Monday and expressed sadness at the civilian suffering as a result of the conflict. He reiterated China's calls for a ceasefire and backing for a two-state solution.
Washington has placed importance on China's ability to influence Iran.
Blinken, during his whirlwind trip last week to the Middle East, held a phone call with Wang asking him to use Beijing's influence in the region to ensure the conflict does not widen.
Wang's trip takes place about three weeks ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco, where there are expectations that President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping might meet.
The US officials did not confirm the leaders' meeting, nor did they say if Wang's visit would prepare for such a meeting. Instead, Wang's trip was described as reciprocal to Blinken's visit to Beijing.
Beijing has yet to confirm if Xi will travel to San Francisco for the annual APEC summit.
US-China relations have been deteriorating since 2018 over issues such as trade, the   in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, the militarisation of the South China Sea, the rising pressure on the self-governed island of Taiwan and the origins of  .
Biden and Xi last met in November 2022 on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in Indonesia. At that time, they agreed to resume talks, set up work groups on specific issues and expand person-to-person exchanges.
US officials said territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas were also likely to be on the agenda, saying that Washington was deeply concerned by China's "destabilising and dangerous actions" in the South China Sea.
The Philippines, a key US ally, this week accused Chinese coastguard vessels of "  " colliding with its vessels on a resupply mission at Second Thomas Shoal, in the most serious incident this year. Beijing claims the shoal as its territory although it lies within Manila's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
Re-establishing military-to-military ties with China also remains a top concern for the US, the officials said, adding that this meant sustained communications throughout the ranks.
 , who has not been seen in public for nearly two months amid a corruption probe, had snubbed US calls to meet. He had been targeted with US sanctions in 2018 over Russian weapons purchases.

Israel has blown up the West Bank house of a senior Hamas official as it aggressively targets the Palestinian group's leadership amid the  .
Footage posted on social media on Tuesday appeared to show Saleh al-Arouri's house completely demolished in the city of Arura, near Ramallah.
Al-Arouri, who is believed to live in exile in Lebanon, is the deputy chairman of Hamas's political bureau. Neither he nor his family were in the house when it was struck.
Israeli forces took over al-Arouri's home 10 days ago and claimed they had begun using it as an intelligence centre.
"It was more of a symbolic move to blow up this house," said Al Jazeera correspondent Bernard Smith, from Ramallah. "Of course, they really want al-Arouri himself … he is considered to be one of the real masterminds behind the October 7 attack that Hamas launched into Israeli territory."
Israel has also announced it has killed another member of Hamas implicated in organising the October 7 attacks that killed 1,400 Israelis.
An Israeli army update on social media platform X said air attacks killed Nasim Abu Ajina, commander of the Beit Lahia battalion in the northern division of Hamas.
The post said Ajina had played a role in developing Hamas's 'drone and paraglider capabilities'.
In a joint statement, Israel's army and the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) said "(Ajina's) elimination significantly harms the efforts of the Hamas terrorist organization to disrupt the IDF's ground activities."
Israel's targeting of the Hamas leaders comes after its ground forces drove into Gaza for the fourth straight night on Monday, marking the most serious escalation of its three-week war.
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said Israeli forces had killed Hamas fighters and 'directed air forces to real-time strikes on targets' during the incursion. Israel's military also reported several engagements in which its forces came under antitank missile and machine gun fire. Hamas claimed to have destroyed an Israeli armoured vehicle east of the Erez crossing in Gaza.
Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected calls for a ceasefire after three weeks of relentless strikes on Gaza that have killed more than 8,000 people, including  .
"This will not happen," Netanyahu told foreign media.
"Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas."

Greek minister hails Turkish u-turn in migration policy

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Athens, Greece – Greece's migration minister has welcomed the Turkish government's willingness to reduce migration flows from Asia into Europe, during an interview with Al Jazeera.
'From the Greek point of view, it looks like a u-turn in a positive way, and we are here to fully take advantage of it and to help the u-turn,' Dimitris Kairidis said.
He was comparing the new Turkish attitude to Ankara's policy in March 2020, when Turkey unilaterally departed from a four-year-old agreement with the European Union that obliged both sides to hold back undocumented refugees and migrants.
Thousands of them stormed the Greek border fence along the Evros river in Thrace, nearly overwhelming Greek police.
Kairidis, whose government took office in July, visited his Turkish counterpart, Ali Yerlikaya, on October 19.
'I was presented with a lot of data from the Turkish side,' Kairidis said.
Turkish authorities said they had arrested 140,000 undocumented people attempting to cross into Europe since the beginning of the year. Some 40,000 had been deported to their countries of origin. And Turkey said it had arrested 5,000 smugglers.
'These are all very positive, and we see especially on the land border with Greece and Bulgaria a very determined action on the part of Turkey's security forces, army police and gendarmerie, to do away with smugglers and flows,' Kairidis said.
The two ministers agreed to regularly exchange and publish migration statistics.
Not only is all quiet on the Evros land border; Greek numbers published on November 1 showed flows have fallen by 42 percent by land and sea.
'Turkey does not want to be an international hub of illegal migration,' said Kairidis, because Turkey was already hosting an estimated 4.7 million refugees, and trafficking 'stimulates increased flows into Turkey at a time of great fluidity'.
But Kairidis believed Turkey's about-turn was also due to the fact that 'the previous policy did not work'.
The Adriana and suspected Greek pushbacks
Arrivals on the Greek islands from the Turkish coast had shot up over the summer. Official Greek monthly bulletins showed increases of 52 percent in June, 69 percent in July, 106 percent in August and 170 percent in September.
Not everyone agreed that these increases were due to Turkish smugglers stepping up their business or Turkish authorities dropping their vigilance.
Aegean Boat Report (ABR), an independent monitor refugees can contact directly to report their whereabouts while travelling, has estimated that the Hellenic Coast Guard prevented almost 2,700 boats filled with potential asylum seekers from reaching Greek shores since March 2020.
Such obstruction is referred to as 'pushbacks' and is illegal under the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, to which Greece is a signatory. The law obliges compliant states to ask whether undocumented refugees and migrants are in need of international protection.
On June 14, the Adriana, a fishing trawler carrying an estimated 700 asylum seekers, capsized before the eyes of the Hellenic Coast Guard. Only 104 people survived.
'For over two weeks no life rafts had been found drifting in the Aegean Sea, and we were hoping that Greek authorities, due to pressure from the international community, had stopped this inhumane illegal practice,' wrote Tommy Olsen, who runs ABR, on July 11.
'We had the same impression, as far as the limitation of pushbacks was concerned,' said Lefteris Papagiannakis, director of the Greek Council for Refugees, a highly respected legal aid NGO. 'The sense we had from the field was that for a period of time, pushbacks were almost non-existent, and there was an increase [in rescues],' he told Al Jazeera.
Papagiannakis believed this 'definitely affected' the number of people held in reception centres on the islands. These held more than 15,000 asylum seekers in September, almost four times the number they held in June.
Kairidis denied that the Hellenic Coast Guard has ever stopped rescuing people.
'I think [the Adriana] was instrumentalised by people on the left who have a very extreme position on migration,' he told Al Jazeera.
'They think that any kind of guarding of borders is illegal and runs against human rights, and Europe has to have an open-door policy welcoming everybody in distress from all over the world. This is obviously a position that is not espoused by the vast majority of European voters,' Kairidis said.
What about Palestinians?
The European Union has been concerned about the possibility of retaliatory attacks on its soil after it lent Israel unequivocal political support in striking back against Hamas for the organisation's October 7 assault.
The European Council on October 26-27 called on member states 'to enhance internal security, including by protection of the external borders'.
Kairidis said Greece has not produced a single attacker.
'We have the oldest Muslim community in Europe,' he said, referring to a 1923 exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, which left intact the Muslims of Thrace and the Greek Christians of Istanbul.
'Unlike other such communities in Bosnia, in Kosovo and in Western Europe, ours has not produced this kind of radicalism,' he said - references to the Albanian Muslims who went to fight with the Islamic State in Syria beginning in 2014 and the 2001 World Trade Center suicide bombers who were largely recruited in Hamburg.
But he does worry about the potential destabilising effects of a large Palestinian exodus from Gaza.
'The biggest worry is Egypt which already hosts almost 9m refugees from the rest of Africa and has been a bedrock of stability for all of us in Europe,' he said. 'Events in Gaza have the potential to destabilise Arab countries.'

One crisis to the next: British Palestinians fleeing Gaza stuck in Egypt

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Nasser Alshanti had hoped to be reunited with his daughter and her family fleeing Gaza by now.
But days after Yosra Alshanti, 25,   into Egypt with her two young daughters, aged six and three-and-a-half years, and husband Ibrahim Taha, 33, Friday, their hopes were dashed, one after another.
'We [went] far with our hope that Yosra could be with us Sunday or Monday morning,' Alshanti told Al Jazeera despondently, then chuckled softly.
The family - all British citizens save for Taha - were to fly to the UK after reaching Egypt's capital Cairo, with British authorities having assured Alshanti that Taha would be given a special clearance to enter the UK, the Manchester-based university lecturer said.
But once they arrived in Cairo by bus, and after having endured three weeks of Israeli bombardment following Hamas's attack on Israel, the family was told there was no such clearance for Taha.
'The British government misled us,' Alshanti said, adding that he had cried on the phone with his daughter once he received the news.
Taha was permitted 72 hours to stay in Egypt, which ended Monday, while his return to Gaza, a war zone, is out of the question. The Rafah border remains closed for those seeking to enter the blockaded territory, only   and critically wounded Palestinians on their way out - and the family has no desire to be split up.
As they remain in limbo in Egypt, Yosra told her father that it would have been better to have stayed in Gaza, where   have killed more than 10,000 people, and left another 25,000 injured, with people running for their lives from aerial bombardment and ground attacks.

"It's better for us to stay in Cairo, even if on the streets, to protest in front of the British embassy to take us back to Gaza, rather than to come to the UK by myself and leave my husband," Yosra told Alshanti, he said.
The concerned father has been desperately trying to help from abroad.
'We rescued them from one crisis and put them in another crisis,' he lamented.
Throw them 'in the street'
British embassy staff in Cairo told the family to apply for Taha's visa to the UK via normal visa procedures, Alshanti said.
While the British government's advice for its nationals and their dependents remains that they leave Gaza, people fleeing who do require a visa will require one in advance of travel to the UK, according to the UK Home Office.
"We are pleased that the Rafah crossing has now reopened. We remain in contact with British Nationals in the region to provide them with the latest information," a UK Home Office spokesperson told Al Jazeera in a statement. "This continues to be a complex and challenging situation and we are using all diplomatic channels to press for British Nationals and humanitarian aid to pass safely through the crossing."
But when the family received the news about having to apply for a visa, they were disheartened, the information contrary to what British authorities had promised Alshanti, he said.
The ordinary visa process can take several weeks - if it is approved - and requires several pieces of documentation, which Taha does not have on him, Alshanti said.
The family fled with almost no belongings as they left their home in northern Gaza in a hurry as per Israeli evacuation orders, he added.
On Monday, British authorities also told the family they must cover their own stay in Cairo from then on, according to a WhatsApp voice recording Al Jazeera heard that Alshanti said was from a British embassy staffer.
British authorities had put the family up in a hotel for the first three nights but would not be able to cover any "extra" nights, the staffer said in the recording.
But the family fled to Egypt with just $100, having spent most of their money while sheltering from the war, Alshanti said.
'Now they will throw Yosra with the children in the street,' he decried.
After checking out of their hotel on Monday, Yosra and her family spent several hours in a coffee shop while Alshanti scrambled to find accommodation for his family from afar.
He managed to arrange for the family to stay in the flat of a friend from Cairo, where the young family now awaits.
'Treating us as animals'
On Monday, the family filed a visa application based on a recommendation the UK Home Office made to the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), after receiving no support from the British embassy in Cairo, Alshanti said.
The application, which Al Jazeera saw a copy of, is one which unites parents with their children who are British citizens living in the UK.
While the family has been living in Gaza for the last seven years, and while they did not have all the documentation required for the visa, they are hopeful the application will be approved, said Alshanti.
The lecturer has taken on the fees for the visa, having paid $2,330 for the application itself, according to the copy seen by Al Jazeera, and another roughly $2,230 to expedite the process, he said.
The UK Home Office has told Alshanti they will work to process Taha's application in 48 hours, he said Tuesday.
But Alshanti is unsure if it all will work out so easily - as since the start of the war, nothing has, he said.
He has watched the events in the Gaza Strip unfold over the last weeks with trepidation, wondering just when his daughter and her family will be able to get out safely.
Alshanti is frustrated by the British government's treatment of his family, saying it is the right of British citizens to be supported while fleeing war.
'They are treating us as animals, as Israel classified us,' the desperate father said, referring to   by Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallantwhen announcing a complete siege on Gaza in early October. 'They are not treating us as human.'

Many people had already been watching al-Shifa, aghast, as   at Gaza's biggest hospital, starved as it was of the fuel needed to run its generators.

Putin to meet Xi in Beijing: Five things to know

October 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Russian President Vladimir Putin has   and is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Wednesday.
Ties between Russia and China have deepened in recent years, and Putin and Xi have developed a strong personal friendship. The two men last met in March in Moscow.
Putin's trip to China during which he will take part in a forum to mark 10 years of the Belt and Road Initiative, is the first time this year that the Russian leader has travelled to a country beyond those that were once part of the former Soviet Union.
"(The) Russian delegation's presence in Beijing is important for Moscow," Alicja Bachulska, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the AFP news agency.
"It will legitimise Russia in the international arena by creating a positive image of Putin not being completely isolated in the context of war."
Here are five things to know:
A deepening friendship …
Xi and Putin forged their friendship when the pair shared cake and vodka shots to mark the Russian leader's birthday at a summit in Indonesia in 2013.
They have since drawn closer, with Xi accompanying Putin on a high-speed train ride across China to make traditional steamed buns five years later, and the two men eating caviar-topped blini during a river cruise when Xi later visited Russia.
In 2019, the Russian leader threw Xi a birthday party, surprising him with ice cream at a conference in Tajikistan.
On a visit to Moscow the same year, Xi told Russian media: "President Putin is the foreign colleague that I have interacted with most extensively. He is my best friend, and I greatly treasure our friendship."

In an interview with Chinese state media ahead of the latest visit, Putin was effusive in his praise for Xi, praising the relevance and significance of Xi's policies and vision of a multipolar world.
Broadcaster CGTN said that Putin described Xi as a "true world leader'.
The two men were born just a few months apart in the early 1950s.
While Xi was the scion of a family of communist revolutionaries, Putin was born in more humble circumstances before becoming an intelligence officer in the Soviet Union.
Both men found lessons in the collapse of the USSR – for Putin, it was a humiliation and a "major geopolitical disaster" and for Xi, a cautionary tale for China's own Communist Party.
… and closer bilateral ties
In line with their leaders' deepening friendship, China and Russia have also moved closer.
Putin was last in Beijing in February 2022, just days before he sent thousands of troops across the border into Ukraine in what he called a "special military operation".
At that time the two men signed an agreement promising a 'no-limits' relationship.  By March this year, they were talking of a "  " of cooperation.
Russia is now China's second-largest trade partner outside Asia, and trade between the two countries surged 30 percent in the first half of this year, Russian Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said on a visit to China.

Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that from China's view, 'Russia is a safe neighbour that is friendly, that is a source of cheap raw materials, that's a support for Chinese initiatives on the global stage and that's also a source of military technologies, some of those that China doesn't have.'
'For Russia, China is its lifeline, economic lifeline in its brutal repression against Ukraine,' Gabuev told The Associated Press news agency.
Israel-Hamas war
Putin comes to Beijing amid expectations that Israel could soon launch a ground invasion of the blockaded Palestinian enclave of Gaza.
The issue was high on the agenda when the Russian and Chinese foreign ministers held talks in Beijing on Monday, with both calling for intensified efforts to avoid a  .
"It is imperative that a ceasefire be put in place, that the two sides be brought back to the negotiating table, and that an emergency humanitarian channel be established to prevent a further humanitarian disaster," Wang said at the meeting, according to a Chinese transcript of the meeting.
A Russian-drafted UN Security Council resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire failed to get the minimum nine votes needed in the 15-member body on Monday, and Putin and Xi are likely to pick up the baton on the issue.
Putin held multiple calls with leaders in the region on Monday including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
He told Netanyahu that Moscow wanted to help prevent a humanitarian disaster.
China's state broadcaster CCTV reported earlier that Zhai Jun, Beijing's special envoy on the Middle East, will visit the region this week to push for a ceasefire and promote peace talks.
Ukraine war
Even amid the deepening crisis in the Middle East, Russia's continuing conflict in Ukraine is also likely to feature in the talks between the two men.
Recent reports suggest   on the eastern front around Avdiivka, as well as in the northeastern Kupiansk-Lyman area.
Beijing has sought to portray itself as a neutral party in the war and in March, about the time of Xi's visit to Moscow, embarked on a flurry of diplomatic activity to promote its 12-point peace plan.
Those efforts have made little headway and Ukraine's allies have largely dismissed Beijing's attempt to position itself as mediator.
Still, on a visit to China that ended at the weekend, European Union policy chief Josep Borrell urged China to do what it could to end the war in Ukraine. Borrell said he had conveyed to the Chinese that the EU considered Russia "a huge threat" to its security and that the group was committed to supporting Ukraine.
The EU is expected to have a summit with China before the end of the year.
Energy
Oil and gas is a key concern for Russia amid international sanctions, and the bosses of Russia's Gazprom and Rosneft are said to be part of Putin's delegation to Beijing.
Russia is eager to secure a deal to sell more natural gas to China and plans to build the Power of Siberia-2 pipeline, which would travel through Mongolia and have an annual capacity of 50 billion cubic metres (bcm).
For China, Russia is not only a major source of oil and gas: one of the world's biggest nuclear powers is also a rich potential source of technology as its People's Liberation Army (PLA) seeks to modernise its conventional and nuclear forces by 2035.
Russian aviation, rocket and even submarine technology have been shared over recent decades with China, according to a 2022 assessment by the United States.
China and Russia also cooperate closely on civilian nuclear plants.

'Inhumane': World reacts to Israeli attacks on Jabalia refugee camp

November 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A barrage of Israeli air strikes on a densely populated refugee camp near Gaza City has drawn condemnation from governments and NGOs across the globe.
An attack on Tuesday evening on the Jabalia refugee camp demolished several apartment buildings, leaving craters in their place. Footage from the scene showed women and children being helped down half-destroyed buildings as rescuers and local residents dug through the rubble to find survivors.
The Ministry of Health in Gaza said more than 50 people were killed in the attack and 150 were wounded. The Indonesian Hospital, where most of the victims were taken, confirmed that more than 50 people were killed.
Hamas's military wing said on Wednesday that seven of its civilian captives have been killed in the strikes, including three foreign passport holders.
'We are still counting the numbers and the people," Hamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera. "We are still trying to find the people under the rubble. Maybe at the end of that, tomorrow, we can talk about the exact numbers and maybe some names.'
Al Jazeera's Wael Dahdouh reported on Wednesday afternoon that Jabalia had been hit again by intense air strikes.
'Appalled'
The strikes were denounced by several states as well as the European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell.
The EU commissioner for foreign affairs wrote on the social media platform X: "I am appalled by the high number of casualties following the bombing by Israel of the Jabalia refugee camp."
Building on EU Council's clear stance that Israel has the right to defend itself in line with international humanitarian law and ensuring the protection of all civilians, I am appalled by the high number of casualties following the bombing by Israel of the Jabalia refugee camp.
- Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF) November 1, 2023
 
In a statement  issued by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Saudi Arabia condemned 'in the strongest way possible the inhumane targeting by the Israeli occupation forces of the Jabalia refugee camp'.
Qatar said the strikes were undermining its mediation efforts to secure the release of more than 200 captives held by Hamas in Gaza.
'The expansion of Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip to include civilian objects, like hospitals, schools, population centres and shelters for displaced people, is a dangerous escalation in the course of confrontations, which would undermine mediation and de-escalation efforts,' Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement .
The United Arab Emirates said  it 'reaffirmed the need for an immediate ceasefire' and 'underscored that indiscriminate attacks will result in irreparable ramifications in the region'.
Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said it 'strongly condemns Israel's inhumane targeting of an entire residential square in Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that left hundreds killed and injured' while Yemen called on "the international community to take an immediate stance to stop these crimes".
Interim Pakistani Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar similarly urged the international community to play its role in ending such attacks.
"Yesterday's air raid on Jabalia camp, where hundreds of lives were lost, including women and children, was a stark reminder of ongoing Israeli brutalities and war crimes in Gaza," Kakar said in a statement on Wednesday.
"Such reprehensible acts can never be condoned or forgotten," he said. "The world must act now to end this carnage."
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,   on Muslim states to cease oil and food exports to Israel to stop the bombardment of Gaza during a speech on Wednesday, according to Iranian state media.
Meanwhile, without naming Jabalia, some states have begun to distance themselves from Israel. Bolivia has  while neighbours Colombia and Chile recalled their ambassadors for consultations.
'A new low'
Humanitarian organisations also expressed criticism of the attack.
'We are horrified by news coming from Jabalia camp where high numbers of people have reportedly been killed by an Israeli airstrike,' Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF), whose staff was at al-Shifa Hospital, where many of the wounded were treated, wrote  on the X social media platform.
Young children arrived at the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns. They came without their families. Many were screaming and asking for their parents. I stayed with them until we could find a place, as the hospital was full with patients. – Mohammed Hawajreh, MSF nurse.
- MSF International (@MSF) October 31, 2023
"Young children arrived at the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns. They came without their families. Many were screaming and asking for their parents," MSF nurse Mohammed Hawajreh said.
UK-based Medical Aid for Palestininians (MAP) said Tuesday's attack should be a ' wake-up call '.
'This attack marks a new low and should serve as a wake-up call to world leaders and politicians everywhere,' said Melanie Ward, MAP's chief executive.
'Their meek requests for compliance with international law are being ignored entirely,' she added. 'Israel has instead increased the ferocity of its indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. One child is being killed every 10 minutes as a result and entire families obliterated.'
Stranded
Although more than half of Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians have fled their homes, several hundred thousand remain stranded in the north, where Israeli troops and tanks have advanced on multiple sides of Gaza City.
An Israel army statement said the air strikes on Jabalia had killed Ibrahim Biari, a Hamas commander, whom it said was "pivotal" in the planning and execution of the deadly attacks on October 7 into southern Israel, which set off the latest Israel-Gaza conflict. Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem denied any senior commander was in the camp.
So far, at least 8,796 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, including 3,648 children. The number of child deaths is   than have died in all conflicts around the world in each of the past four years.
More than 1,400 people have died in Israel, mostly in the October 7 attack.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls for a ceasefire.

US synagogue head killed as police warn against speculation over motive

The president of a synagogue in the United States has been found stabbed to death outside her home, according to police, who cautioned against speculation over the motive.
Samantha Woll, the head of the Isaac Agree Downtown Detroit Synagogue, was found dead "with multiple stab wounds", police in Detroit said on Saturday.
Police said a trail of blood led officers to the 40-year-old Jewish leader's home, where the crime is believed to have occurred.
Detroit Police Department chief James E White asked the public to be patient and not draw conclusions until police fully investigated the case.
'Over the course of the last several hours, the DPD has mobilised many of its resources and has been leveraging every law enforcement and community resource it has to help further the investigation,' White said in a statement.
'An update on the investigation will be forthcoming tomorrow.'
The FBI is assisting in the investigation at the request of Detroit police.
Detroit has long ranked as one of the most violent cities in the US, with a crime rate well above the national average.
Woll's death comes as authorities are handling an increasing number of reports of threats against Jewish, Muslim, and Arab communities amid tensions over the Israel-Hamas war.
On Thursday, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said he had directed local authorities to reach out to religious communities in their districts to "reaffirm our commitment to them and to assess what additional support they may need".
Last week, a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy was stabbed to death near Chicago in what authorities say was a hate crime motivated by the current fighting in the Middle East.
Besides her connections to Detroit's Jewish community, Woll was known for her work with the Democratic Party on local and state campaigns.
Political leaders in the state of Michigan, including Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, state Attorney General Dana Nessel and US Representative Rashida Tlaib, expressed condolences over her death.
'My friend, and a member of our organizing community, Sam Woll, was murdered. I have no words,' Tlaib said in a Facebook post.
'She always had a sweet smile to offer and the warmest eyes to greet you. Our community is devastated and shocked.'

Joe Biden meets with China's Xi Jinping on sidelines of APEC summit

US President Joe Biden has met Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an economic summit in California, where they shook hands and spoke about ways to  .
The meeting took place on Wednesday during a conference for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative (APEC), and comes amid a period of mounting tension between Washington and Beijing.
Biden said that the two countries should strive to make sure they do not 'veer into conflict' and manage their relationship "responsibly".
Xi called the US-China relationship "the most important bilateral relationship in the world", and said he and Biden "shoulder heavy responsibilities for the two peoples, for the world, and for history".
"For two large countries like China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option," he said. "It is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other, and conflict and confrontation has unbearable consequences for both sides."
Officials on both sides of the Pacific have set expectations low as Biden and Xi are set to discuss Taiwan, the South China Sea,   Russia's invasion of Ukraine, North Korea and human rights – areas where the leaders have been unable to resolve long-standing disagreements.
Cooperation between the US and China, which make up the first and second-largest economies in the world, respectively, remains vital for progress on global issues such as climate change. But both sides have expressed mounting frustration with the other, disagreeing over issues such as technology and global politics.
Washington has accused China of offering Russia an economic lifeline as Moscow carries out a bloody invasion of Ukraine, which the US has backed with military assistance and humanitarian aid.
The two sides have also differed on issues in the Middle East, where China has called for a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Ha  mas. The US has used its position on the United Nations Security Council to veto calls for a ceasefire and has thrown its support behind Israel.
The two have also clashed over technology and trade, with the US instituting new measures in an effort to hobble China's microchip industry.
Iran, fentanyl
During the meeting, Biden is expected to press Xi to use China's influence to urge Iran to avoid provocative action or encouraging its proxies to enter the fray in moves that could spread the Israel-Hamas conflict across the Middle East.
He is also expected to raise alleged Chinese operations to influence foreign elections, the status of US citizens that Washington believes are wrongly detained in China and human rights.
US officials expected concrete steps to restore staff-level conversations between the two countries on issues from military-to-military communications to reducing the flow of fentanyl, managing the growth of artificial intelligence technologies, and managing trade and climate.
Many of the chemicals used to make the opioid drug fentanyl come from China, US officials say.
Before the meeting, both countries backed a new renewable energy target and said they would work to reduce methane and plastic pollution, a renewal of climate cooperation that was suspended after former US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022.

'My voice is our lifeline': Gaza journalist and father amid Israel bombing

Gaza City - Our peaceful Gaza morning was abruptly shattered by relentless streaks of fire and thunderous explosions, enveloping more than 2.3 million residents in a cloud of distress and bewilderment.
As the sound of  , my anxious family and I sought refuge, huddled together in a dimly lit room, hoping - foolishly perhaps - that it was the safest place in our home.
Beside me, my wife, wide-eyed and trembling, held onto my side as we descended the stairs to the room. She repeatedly reassured us that we were safe but the tremor in her voice betrayed the anxiety gripping her.
Even as I tried to convey a sense of hope, I couldn't ignore the fear etched on my family's faces and the tangible vulnerability that hung in the air. My mother, a woman whose wrinkles bore witness to a lifetime of battles with Israel, clung to my two-year-old son, her only grandchild, attempting to shield him from the deafening roar outside. Her whispered words of comfort were a gentle effort to drown out the noise of  .
In that room, we all gathered - my parents, wife, son and sister. Our voices, once filled with morning laughter and curiosity, now spoke in hushed tones with suppressed tears and silent prayers.
Beyond our shelter, the news brought haunting  , with residential buildings crumbling like ancient ruins and clouds of dust and smoke choking the air. Each explosion sent tremors through the ground beneath us, while the cries of people in the streets and the roar of fighter jets above amplified our collective concern.
In that surreal moment, I clung to the belief that my voice was not only my lifeline but also a connection to the world that had often turned a deaf ear to our struggle. As a journalist and writer who miraculously survived five destructive wars with Israel, I know my voice is a link to a world that can, at least, help amplify our calls for safety.
Throughout the day, every couple of hours, we exchanged phone calls, reaching out to loved ones across the city. Neighbours checked on one another and even strangers shared words of solidarity and encouragement. As I write this, I continue to stay strong, even though I am deeply worried inside that we could be a  . Anytime.
But beneath this display of courage, after enduring a day of relentless confrontations, we can't deny the toll of psychological exhaustion that has settled in. Fear still lingers in the eyes of those who have witnessed the early hours of the conflict and the echoes of explosions haunt our hearts.
Every moment is now a battle against grief and the weight of uncertainty presses heavily upon us.
Yet, in Gaza, unity and resilience have become the people's only solace. Amid the fear and destruction, voices of hope and determination whispered as the night unfolded. It is a testament to the unwavering spirit of Palestinians - who are standing together across the occupied territories, united against the occupier attacks.

Dozens of UK's Labour MPs break ranks to vote for Gaza ceasefire

November 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Dozens of British opposition lawmakers have voted to call for a ceasefire in Israel's war in Gaza, underscoring mounting unease within parliamentary ranks regarding Britain's foreign policy stance.
A group of 56 Labour Party lawmakers went against the party line on Wednesday by voting to amend the government's legislative agenda to officially urge for a ceasefire in Gaza.
The proposed legislative addition, introduced by the Scottish National Party, said the United Kingdom should 'join with the international community in urgently pressing all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire'.
While the amendment did not pass, the strong support from the left-wing Labour Party put pressure on the bloc's leadership.
More than a third of 198 Labour MPs backed the proposal, including eight members of party leader Keir Starmer's policy team who abandoned their shadow ministerial posts to voice dissent.
Starmer has taken the same line on the Gaza war as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, calling only for 'humanitarian pauses' as opposed to a full ceasefire in Gaza.
Jess Phillips, a Labour deputy who backed the call for a ceasefire, said she was stepping down from her role as shadow domestic abuse and safeguarding minister with a 'heavy heart'.
pic.twitter.com/BKPky5uxGy
- Jess Phillips MP (@jessphillips) November 15, 2023
"On this occasion I must vote with my constituents, my head and my heart," Phillips said in a letter to Starmer posted on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.
"I can see no route where the current military action does anything but put at risk the hope of peace and security for anyone in the region now and in the future."
Divisions within Labour
The growing disquiet within Labour is challenging Starmer as he seeks to put on a united front ahead of elections next year that Labour is on pace to win, according to polls.
After the vote, Starmer said he regretted that some colleagues 'felt unable to support the position'.
'But I wanted to be clear about where I stood, and where I will stand," Starmer said.
Global pressure for a ceasefire in Gaza has been mounting more than a month into  , which has killed more than 11,500 Palestinians, including thousands of children.
Israel's air raids and ground invasion have also displaced 1.5 million people and wrecked the territory's infrastructure.
Large protests calling for a Gaza ceasefire have swept the UK, including outside parliament during Wednesday's vote.
Starmer, while opposing a full ceasefire, had sought to toughen the party's position to say humanitarian pauses "must be longer to deliver humanitarian assistance … a necessary step to an enduring cessation of fighting as soon as possible'.
That amendment was backed by 183 lawmakers, with 290 voting against it.
King Charles III, in his maiden King's Speech on November 7 outlining the government's upcoming policy agenda, reiterated the UK's   for Israel.
He said the government would work to address the world's 'most pressing security challenges', including 'the consequences of the barbaric acts of terrorism against the people of Israel'.
King Charles said Britain would also help bring 'humanitarian support into Gaza and [support] the cause of peace and stability in the Middle East'.

'Why bomb schools?' Gaza families have no safe space amid Israeli attacks

Jamal Al Zinati is in a state of shock and disbelief.
The 33-year-old is a perfume dealer, but today, it's the stench of death and destruction that's overpowering — in his neighbourhood and all of the Gaza Strip.
Jamal is   of a school run by UNRWA — the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East — after his entire neighbourhood was blown up by Israeli missiles.
As the war between Israel and Hamas rages for a fourth straight day, once-vibrant neighbourhoods in central Gaza City now lie in ruins. Amid the  , thousands of people have been left with no choice but to seek shelter in overcrowded public spaces and schools, hoping for relative safety. In addition to Israel's air-tight blockade, the destruction wrought by the bombing has further shrunk the space available for them to live, to survive, to breathe.
Entire families find themselves homeless, their neighbourhoods flattened. Across the Gaza Strip, plumes of smoke haze the skyline.
'When we ran out the door, all we thought was Israel probably would just threaten us to leave to push fear in our hearts,' Jamal says. 'I did not believe they would air strike the whole area and leave it in black ruins.'
That includes his home, a place he recalls as filled with happy memories that meant 'everything' to his family. 'It's where we lived happily, celebrated birthdays and built dreams.'
'Now, it's nothing but rubble,' he whispers, tears welling up in his eyes. 'We fled to a nearby school for safety, but we are crammed in here with hundreds of others. There's no space, and our children cry themselves to sleep every night.'
Yet even in the schools where the people of Gaza are taking shelter, their lives as marked with deprivation amid a looming  . The blockade means the Gaza Strip is dependent on Israel for supplies of food, fuel, medicines and electricity. Now, Israel has said it will cut even those essential supplies — a decision that under international law could constitute a war crime.
Already, basic necessities are in short supply. 'We barely have enough food to feed our children,' says Zainab Matar, a mother of four. 'Clean drinking water is a luxury, and we can't keep our children warm at night because we lack proper clothing.'
Schools are no longer safe spaces, either. According to UNRWA, at least four schools in Gaza have suffered damage from Israeli bombing. 'We thought coming to the school would protect us, but even here, we live in constant fear,' Zainab says.
It's a fear that's visible and palpable across the Gaza Strip — in the eyes of mothers and fathers, children and grandparents. A fear that even schools are no longer immune to.
Aseel, another displaced resident, is scared, too. 'We can't understand why schools, where innocent people are seeking refuge, are being bombed," she says.

White House walks back Biden's claim he saw children beheaded by Hamas

The White House has walked back President Joe Biden's claim that he saw pictures of beheaded children following  .
The reversal came after Biden on Wednesday described seeing images of mutilated children during a meeting with Jewish leaders at the White House.
"I never really thought that I would see, have confirmed, pictures of terrorists beheading children," said Biden, who described Saturday's attack as the "deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust".
Unverified claims about the beheading of Israeli children and sexual assault of hostages by the Palestinian armed group have gone viral on social media in the days following Saturday's attack.
The claims blew up after Nicole Zedek, a reporter with Tel Aviv-based news channel i24, said during a live broadcast that she had spoken to Israeli soldiers who had witnessed decapitated babies.
In a response to questions by The Washington Post, a White House spokesperson said the president's comments were based on news reports and claims by the Israeli government.
"A White House spokesperson later clarified that US officials and the president have not seen pictures or confirmed such reports independently," The Post reported on Wednesday.
"The president based his comments about the alleged atrocities on the claims from Netanyahu's spokesman and media reports from Israel, according to the White House."
Biden's claims were featured on the front pages of Western newspapers, and reports of beheaded babies have been cited in some quarters as justification for revenge attacks and the collective punishment of civilians in Gaza.
The Israeli army has said that it cannot confirm the claims, which were repeated on Wednesday by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesperson Tal Heinrich.
But Israeli military officials have told a number of media outlets that women and children were 'brutally butchered in an ISIS way of action'.
Hamas has denied claims that its fighters beheaded children and assaulted women, calling them "lies".
Social media platforms such as Facebook, X and TikTok have been   on the Israel-Hamas war, according to an Al Jazeera investigation.
Of all platforms, Elon Musk's X appears to have been the most prone to unverified information related to the war, including claims of beheadings and rapes.
More than 1,300 people were killed and 3,000 injured in the Hamas attack inside Israel, according to Israeli officials.
Israel's retaliatory bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 1,200 people and left more than 5,600 others injured.

Hamas blames US for giving Israel 'green light' to raid al-Shifa Hospital

November 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
US President Joe Biden is "wholly responsible" for the Israeli assault on Gaza's largest hospital, said Hamas, the Palestinian group that rules the enclave.
The accusation came in a statement on Wednesday, a day after the White House said US intelligence sources corroborated Israel's claims that Hamas has buried an operational centre under the hospital.
"We hold the occupation [Israel] and President Biden wholly responsible for the assault on al-Shifa medical complex," Hamas said.
"The adoption by the White House and the Pentagon of the occupation's false claim that the resistance is using al-Shifa medical complex for military ends has given the green light to the occupation to commit more massacres against civilians," the statement continued.
Israeli forces said on Wednesday morning that they were carrying out a "precise and targeted operation" against a suspected Hamas command centre beneath al-Shifa, where thousands of civilians are sheltering.
Youssef Abul Reesh, an official from the Hamas-run health ministry who is inside the hospital, told the AFP news agency that he could see tanks inside the complex and "dozens of soldiers and commandos inside the emergency and reception buildings".
After sharp warnings from the United States and others that al-Shifa must be protected, Israel said the raid was being executed based on "an operational necessity".
Israel has repeatedly claimed that Hamas's military use of the facility "jeopardises its protected status under international law" – a claim that many international human rights lawyers refute.
 
Ardi Imseis, an international law expert at Queen's University in Canada, told Al Jazeera that Israel has a history of presenting questionable and unverifiable evidence to the international community.
Imseis added Israel carries the burden to 'produce evidence' and prove its claim that the hospital has been used by Hamas as a base.
'The object of the attack is a civilian object. Until such time that the Israelis provide proof that it has been converted into a military object, the civilian nature of the object does not change,' he said.
According to medical staff, an estimated 650 patients remain in the hospital. A further 5,000-7,000 displaced civilians are trapped inside the hospital grounds and under constant fire from Israeli snipers and drones, according to the health ministry.
Spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra told Al Jazeera Arabic that 'there are only doctors, patients and displaced people' inside al-Shifa. 'We have nothing to be afraid of or hide."
The White House expressed concern shortly after the raid began.
"We do not support striking a hospital from the air and we don't want to see a firefight in a hospital," a National Security Council spokesperson said.
The official added that there should not be a situation in which "innocent people, helpless people, sick people trying to get medical care they deserve are caught in the crossfire".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to destroy Hamas in response to its attacks on southern Israel on October 7, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 240 captives being taken to Gaza.
Israel's attacks on Gaza since have so far killed more than 11,300 people.

Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp has been bombed again a day after Israel attacked the densely populated camp triggering global condemnation. Here is what we know so far:
What happened, how many killed?
At least 50 people were killed after six Israeli air raids hit a residential area of the camp on Tuesday. A Hamas statement said there were 400 dead and injured in the attack. Casualty figures for Wednesday's attacks are still not known.
At least 11 Israeli soldiers were killed during its incursion in northern Gaza on Tuesday, the Israeli military said.
Hamas's armed wing, the  , said seven civilian hostages were killed in the Jabalia attack, including three foreign passport holders. There was no comment from Israel on the claim.
The Israeli military has   since the beginning of the war, including on  , killing and wounding hundreds of people.
The air raid came amid Israel's   of the Gaza Strip which has killed 8,525 people, including more than 3,500 children, since fighting began on October 7, Palestinian authorities have said.
Where in Gaza did the attack take place?
Jabalia is located in the north of the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli army has carried out one of the deadliest bombings.
What has Israel said?
An Israeli military statement said that the attacks on Jabalia had killed Hamas commander Ibrahim Biari. The military believes Biari played a pivotal role in the planning and execution of the Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7.
"There was a very senior Hamas commander in that area," Israeli army spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht told CNN.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that Hamas fighters had two options - "either be killed or surrender without conditions".
"That is the war [for] the future of Israel – nothing less," he said.
What has Hamas said?
Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem has denied that any senior commander was present in the refugee camp and deemed the claim an Israeli excuse for killing civilians.
How have other countries reacted?
Several Arab countries have issued statements condemning Israel for its attack on the Gaza refugee camp. These include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Yemen and Jordan. Qatar also warned that the attacks undermine mediation in the region.
Condemnations also came from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, as well as Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit.
The European Union Commissioner for Foreign Affairs wrote on social media platform X, 'I am appalled by the high number of casualties following the bombing by Israel of the Jabalia refugee camp.'
The attack amidst Gaza's total blockade
The attack happened amid Israel's continued total blockade on Gaza, which severely restricts access to water, electricity, food, and fuel for the strip's more than 2.3 million residents.
Gaza's medical workers are now struggling with dwindling supplies of medicines and power cuts.
Two of Gaza's main hospitals – al-Shifa Medical and the Indonesian Hospital – faced a power outage as their generators rapidly ran out of fuel.
Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesperson for the Gaza health ministry, called on petrol station owners in the enclave to urgently provide fuel as doctors worked around the clock to treat casualties with whatever supplies they have at hand.

Bank of Israel to sell $30bn of forex after shekel falls

October 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Bank of Israel says it will sell up to $30bn of foreign currency in the open market to maintain stability of the shekel during   in the Gaza Strip.
Monday's announcement, the central bank's first ever sale of foreign exchange, appeared to quickly restore calm in the market as the shekel recovered from steep early losses on Monday.
"The bank will operate in the market during the coming period in order to moderate volatility in the shekel exchange rate and to provide the necessary liquidity for the continued proper functioning of the markets," the central bank said in a statement.
It said it would provide liquidity in the market of up to $15bn through SWAP mechanisms, a derivative contract in which one party swaps the cash flows or value of one asset for another.
"The Bank of Israel will continue monitoring developments, tracking all the markets, and acting with the tools available to it as necessary," it said.
Ahead of the announcement, the shekel had weakened by more than 2 percent to a near-eight-year low of 3.92 per dollar. The shekel early on Monday recovered to 3.86 per dollar, down 0.6 percent.
Israeli stock and bond prices
The shekel had already been down 10 percent against the dollar so far in 2023, largely due to a bid by the Israeli government to overhaul the judiciary.
Israeli stock and bond prices on Sunday slid 7 percent while many businesses were closed after Hamas gunmen the previous day launched a multifront attack on Israel, killing at least 800 Israelis and abducting dozens more in the deadliest incursion into Israeli territory in decades.
Israel has amassed forex reserves of more than $200bn, much of it from buying forex since 2008 to try to keep the shekel from strengthening too much and hurting exporters.
The last time the bank intervened was in January 2022.
Last month, Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron told the Reuters news agency that despite the sharply weaker shekel helping to push up inflation, there was no need to intervene because there were no market failures.
Fighting in Israel and Gaza continued into a third day on Monday with authorities reporting the deaths of at least 560 Palestinians.

Israel opens new embassy in Bahrain, agrees to boost trade relations

Israel's foreign minister has agreed with his Bahraini counterpart to boost trade relations, during his first visit to one of the two Gulf Arab states to  .
"The foreign minister and I agreed that we should work together to increase the number of direct flights, the tourism, the trade volume, the investment," Eli Cohen said during a ceremony to inaugurate Israel's new embassy in Bahrain on Monday.
The embassy in the capital Manama will replace the first embassy Israel opened in 2021, a year after it established diplomatic relations with Bahrain as part of the United States-brokered Abraham Accords.
Under the accords, Israel also established ties with the United Arab Emirates and Morocco.
Monday's ceremony was attended by Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdullatif al-Zayani, who said the "new embassy assumes a pivotal role" in growing collaboration between the two countries.
Zayani said his talks with Cohen on Monday resulted in an agreement on advancing "relations across the broadest range of fields, including, economic, investment, trade and other areas".
Cohen arrived in Bahrain on Sunday, accompanied by a business delegation of more than 30 companies working in high-tech, logistics and real estate.
Earlier on Monday, he met Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa and discussed "the importance of advancing a free trade agreement and projects to connect youths in Israel and Bahrain", Cohen posted on X, formerly Twitter.
"We look forward to expanding the circle of peace and normalisation to other states in the area," he said.
Despite now having steady ties with Israel, Bahrain and the UAE have joined other Gulf Arab states in issuing a series of condemnations against it this year.
Raids on the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem and the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank were among Israeli moves that sparked criticism from the Gulf.
However, Cohen's trip coincides with growing speculation about an impending normalisation deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which is not a signatory to the Abraham Accords.
Riyadh and Washington have held talks on Saudi conditions for progress on normalisation with Israel, according to people briefed on the meetings.
"There are more Arab and Muslim countries that have shown interest in taking a step forward in joining the peace circle," Cohen told a news conference in Manama, without naming them.
Cohen was at the centre of controversy at the end of August, after he revealed that he had secretly met his Libyan counterpart in Rome to discuss normalisation.
The revelation led to  , where pro-Palestinian sentiment is strong,  , and censure for Cohen from within Israel, where he was attacked by the opposition for revealing the details of such a sensitive meeting.

Israel-Hamas war: List of key events, day 15

October 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Here is the   on Saturday, October 21, 2023:
Latest developments
The   between Egypt and Gaza has opened and 20 aid trucks have entered the besieged enclave. But humanitarian groups say this initial aid is still 'a drop in the ocean'.
The 20 aid trucks are going to be allowed to move to an area between the Egyptian gate and the Palestinian gate. Then the aid is going to be driven to United Nations warehouses from which it will be distributed across the Gaza Strip.
Israel kept up heavy bombardment of targets throughout Gaza overnight on Saturday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to "fight until victory" following the release of the first two captives by the enclave's ruling Hamas group.
The  , Judith Raanan and her daughter Natalie, were abducted by Hamas during its October 7 attack on southern Israel.
Hamas's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, freed the hostages 'for humanitarian reasons' after Qatari mediation efforts, its spokesman Abu Ubaida said on Friday.
Israel's 'complete siege' of the enclave continues and it has said that this will not be lifted unless Israeli hostages are freed.
Human Impact
The death toll in Gaza has risen to more than 4,200, and 70 percent of the dead are women and children. More than 13,000 people have been injured.
About 1,400 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas attacks on October 7, and more than 4,000 people have been injured.
Israel   on its citizens to immediately leave Egypt and Jordan, and to try and avoid travelling to other regional countries, as tensions flare over its war in Gaza.
An estimated 200 Israelis, including 30 teenagers and young children and 20 people over the age of 60, are being held captive in Gaza, Israel's public broadcaster Kan said on Thursday, citing military sources.
 
Diplomacy
An international conference dubbed the Cairo Peace Summit is under way in Egypt, to discuss ways to 'de-escalate' the Israel-Hamas war.
Egypt opened a summit on the Gaza crisis on Saturday to try to head off a wider regional war but the assembled Middle Eastern and European leaders are expected to struggle to agree on a common position on the conflict between Israel and Gaza.
Two diplomats said it was unlikely there would be a joint statement from the gathering because of sensitivities around any calls for a ceasefire, and whether to include mention of Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel and Israel's right to defend itself.
UK's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it was important that the conflict between Israel and Hamas didn't escalate to the wider Middle East.
"It's important that the conflict doesn't escalate regionally. That's why I'm talking to as many people as I can across the region," Sunak told reporters this week.
Clashes on Israel's border with   and attempted attacks by Iranian-backed forces elsewhere have fuelled fears of a spillover, particularly if a ground offensive proves bloody.
  with thousands of demonstrators protesting against Israel's actions in Gaza. On Friday people from Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Qatar, Yemen and the West Bank took to the streets.

US 'did not give OK' for Israeli raid of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza

November 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United States has denied giving Israel a green light for a raid on   in the Gaza Strip after backing Israeli claims that the medical facility was being used for military purposes.
Speaking on Wednesday, US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby countered   that President Joe Biden's administration was complicit in the raid.
"We did not give an OK to their military operations around the hospital," Kirby told reporters.
Kirby declined to say whether Israel gave the US advanced warning of the attack during talks between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister   on Tuesday.
"I won't go into detail about the conversation," he said, adding that "there's no expectation by the United States to map it all out."
The US had previously stated that an intelligence assessment backed up Israel's claims that al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza, sat atop a large Hamas command centre.
Kirby said the US remained 'comfortable with our own intelligence assessment'.
Israeli forces raided al-Shifa, which is sheltering hundreds of patients and thousands of displaced Palestinians, early on Wednesday,   from international organisations and political leaders.
'Hospitals are not battlegrounds,' the United Nations undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and its emergency relief coordinator, Martin Griffiths, said in a social media post in response to the raid.
While Biden had   to take 'less intrusive action' at al-Shifa on Monday, Israel does not appear to have taken those demands seriously.
'It really does underscore that even as the US is supporting - not just in spirit but also militarily in billions of dollars annually - Israel's 'defence', as they call it, the Israelis are really proceeding against the wishes, sometimes, of the United States,' Al Jazeera's Kimberly Halkett reported from the White House.
Omar Zaqout, an emergency room worker at the Gaza City facility,   that Israeli soldiers 'detained and brutally assaulted' some of those seeking shelter at the hospital.
The attack followed several days of encirclement by Israeli forces. Hospital staff said on Tuesday that they were barred from exiting the facility and they were   decomposing bodies in a mass grave.
The Israeli military said its troops found an operational command centre and assets belonging to Hamas in   on the hospital, but it has not produced any firm evidence to substantiate the claim that it is a central node of Hamas operations.
Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the troops had found weapons, combat gear and technological equipment there and were continuing their search.
The military also released a video that they said showed some of the materials recovered from an undisclosed building in the hospital compound, including automatic weapons, grenades, ammunition and flak jackets.
The Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Wednesday that the Israeli military did not find any weapons when it stormed the hospital.
"The occupation forces did not find any [military] equipment or weapons in the hospital. Essentially, we don't allow this [weapons in a hospital]," Munir al-Bursh, Health Ministry director, said in a statement.

Gaza is out of fuel, out of time under Israel's bombardment

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Amman, Jordan – At dawn on Tuesday morning, the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza Strip, had run out of diesel to power its generators.
For more than two weeks, nothing has been allowed into the Gaza Strip; no food, water or fuel.
In the past three days, Israel allowed very few aid trucks in via the Rafah land crossing with Egypt. But no fuel - so far, the request for fuel to enter Gaza for humanitarian needs has been declined by Israel.
Israel classed diesel as a 'dual use' good that can be used for military as well as civilian purposes. Therefore, it is heavily controlled or restricted.
However, Israel wrote the rule book on 'kosher fuel' for Gaza, a highly complex system of approvals and monitoring put in place to guarantee that 'civilian use' fuel flows only to Gaza's sole power plant (the GPP).
Siege
The Strip is under siege and constant aerial bombardment by Israel following a surprise attack by the armed wing of Hamas on Israeli territory on October 7, during which 1,405 soldiers and civilians were killed.

By the time the Indonesian Hospital went dark, medical teams across the Gaza Strip had already been using the glow from their mobile phones to perform some procedures for days, to conserve what energy their various hospitals had to run respirators and other machines keeping some of the patients alive.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the aerial assault on the Gaza Strip by the Israeli army has killed 5,791 Palestinian civilians and injured a staggering 16,297, many of whom require hospital treatment.
That is in addition to the patients with chronic conditions and those who were already being treated in a healthcare sector that has long teetered near collapse.
For years, the United Nations has warned that Gaza is on life support, as the situation deteriorated. After 14 days of Israel's 'complete siege', its 2.3 million residents are staring into the abyss.
'The whole aid operation will come to a halt if fuel is not permitted to enter the besieged enclave. Hospital generators, water desalination plants and trucks to redistribute food and medical supplies – all stops,' Thomas White, head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza, told Al Jazeera from their logistics base in Rafah.
'[F]uel is vital for life and we [UNRWA] will run out of fuel for Gaza on Wednesday, that's it.'
White's stark warning comes at a time when 10 of Gaza's 35 hospitals are out of service, either due to heavy damage from Israel's near-constant bombardment of the Strip or a lack of the fuel needed to generate electricity.
'Kosher fuel'
The GPP was targeted by Israeli air raids in two previous conflicts – 2006 and 2014 – deliberate attacks on a civilian object that are forbidden under international humanitarian law and considered a war crime.
The repercussions of these premeditated attacks hamstrung Gaza's efforts to meet the daily electricity demand in the Strip even prior to the current conflict, which was estimated at about 500 megawatts (MW).
Electricity to Gaza comes from two sources: 120MW from Israel, which was withdrawn by Israel's Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant on October 9, and an additional 70MW from the GPP, which ran out of fuel on October 11 and subsequently shut down, leaving people and hospitals relying on generators and fast-dwindling supplies of fuel.
Nothing can enter Gaza without the express permission of Israel and fuel is heavily monitored by Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).
Once a fuel delivery crosses Rafah into Gaza, truck drivers are on the clock, and not permitted to make any stops, for any reason. Any abnormalities are reported back via UN officials to all parties, including COGAT.

Once the vehicle arrives at the power plant, the blue plastic numbered UNOPS security tags sealing the fuel delivery couplings must be cut under the watchful eye of a UN inspector and cross-matched on an electronic list, vetted by Israel.
Israel has the mechanisms in place to allow fuel to be delivered to Gaza. But perhaps this is less about ability and more about desire, or lack thereof.
Reservist Major General Giora Eiland told Israeli media on Monday that Israel's actions in 'creating a severe humanitarian crisis is a necessary means to achieve the goal. Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist.'
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the fuel shortage is affecting the most critical functions of the still-operational hospitals in Gaza, including powering ambulances to transport the wounded and running dialysis machines that more than 1,000 patients depend on.
Living by the finest of margins
Since 2007, Gaza's residents have endured no fewer than five conflicts that killed thousands of civilians and damaged vital infrastructure. They have lived by the finest of margins for years.

Before the current assault on the enclave, the land, sea and air blockade imposed on it by Israel for the past 16 years devastated the economy, which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the world – nearly 50 percent and rising to 70 percent among youth.
It also created one of the worst humanitarian crises of modern times with 81.5 percent of the population now below the poverty line. A sizeable portion of the population needs aid to survive.
'Another major issue [under the current siege] is the current mechanism averaging about 20 trucks of humanitarian aid a day, is nowhere near what we require to sustain the people of Gaza.
'Prior to the conflict, on an ordinary day, 455 trucks were entering Gaza, to support the population,' White said.
Civilians in Gaza, already on their knees, now have only to worry about surviving the day or through the night, convinced that the world has abandoned them to Israel's assault.
One thing that seems to be certain is if fuel does not enter the enclave – and immediately – hundreds, if not thousands, more people will die.

Gaza City – Freelance journalist Rakan Abdelrahman works out of a cafe, wearing his vest marked "press", ready to rush out if he needs to as he reports on Israel's bombing of the Gaza Strip.
But Abdelrahman, whose work has appeared in Middle East Eye and The National, is not just covering a story. Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip, like Abdelrahman, are trying to defy the odds - and death - to bring the horrors of war to the world amid difficulties that threaten to hobble their work.
For 10 days, Israeli warplanes have been bombing the coastal enclave relentlessly and have killed 2,808 Palestinians, a quarter of them children. A further 10,859 have been wounded in aerial bombardments and on Monday, the interior ministry said that the   are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by bombs.
Last week, Israel bombed the communications tower in the besieged territory and   to the strip's sole power plant. The actions are part of the 'total siege' Israel has implemented in response to the surprise attack on October 7 by Hamas fighters on the Israeli military bases and surrounding Israeli towns and settlements outside of the Gaza Strip. At least 1,400 Israelis were killed in the attack.
The bombings and the siege have left the Gaza Strip without reliable internet or electricity. This has made the work of journalists - already risky and challenging in a war zone - even harder.
"Due to bad internet connection and electricity outages, we can't report on something in real-time. There is no appropriate place to work from anyway," Abdelrahman tells Al Jazeera, adding that journalists wearing clearly marked press vests and helmets have been targeted.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 15 journalists have already been killed  in the Gaza Strip since October 7.
"We can't cover the site of massacres or even get to the places that have been bombed for fear that another Israeli attack will target the same area," Abdelrahman says. "Every second you are in danger. Our colleagues have paid the price with their lives, such as Saeed al-Taweel, Mohammed Subh and Hisham Alnwajha."
The three journalists were   after going out to film a building in Gaza City about to be bombed. They were all standing at a safe distance, hundreds of metres from the stated target of the Hiji building, but the air attack instead hit a different building, much closer to them.
Residents in the Gaza Strip, which has a population of 2.3 million people – more than half of whom are under the age of 18 – have said the current war is the most ferocious out of the previous offensives in the last 15 years. At least 1 million people have been internally displaced.
Abdelrahman says that in addition to fearing for his life when he is reporting, his mind is also preoccupied with concerns for his family and his four children.
"I think about their psychological state of mind, their exposure to this horrific war," he says. "During the previous Israeli wars, they were too young to remember, but now that they're older, it's been extremely difficult for them and for me to witness the fear that's engulfed them."
Ghazi al-Aloul, a correspondent for Jordan's al-Roya TV channel, said that juggling these two fears is part and parcel of being a journalist in the Gaza Strip.

On Sunday, his family, including his pregnant wife and three-year-old daughter, survived an Israeli attack on the building they were staying at in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, the publication al-Roya reported .
"Of course, you're torn between your responsibility as a journalist in conveying the truth and the risks that come with that, versus what your family is going through," al-Aloul says. "I think we're used to these pressures now. We will always continue our work no matter what obstacles come our way."
"We all know that Israel acts with total impunity and disregard to international law, and we always try convey that as much as possible in our coverage," he adds.
I am trying to do my job of spreading what is happening in Gaza, but the lack of internet and electricity prevents me from doing so. Very sorry it's out of my hands.

Coupled with the lack of internet and electricity, many journalists are not working from their media offices. Instead, they gather in whatever cafe is open, confirming information with each other and filing their reports.
The Shifa Hospital in Gaza City has also become a hub for journalists and reporters, offering them a chance to charge their phones despite running on generators.
It also provides them with access to information they otherwise could not know, due to the lack of electricity and disruption to mobile phone networks, in the form of the dead and wounded arriving from the different areas bombed by Israel.

"When there is no internet, this results in censoring the journalist as they cannot report on information or news in different areas in the Gaza Strip," Shorouq Shaheen, a correspondent for Syria TV says.
'We are still covering the news but we have become limited in our coverage," she says. "We learn where an Israeli air attack took place when the dead and injured come to the hospital. But what happens to the attacks in different places that we can't get to? How can we cover that immediately?"
Al-Aloul admits that journalists know the risk to their lives and that "there's a chance that we could end up being the news instead".
But the deaths of their fellow colleagues only "gives us more motivation to carry on working in their names and memories", he says.
"We, as journalists, have always proved that we are up to the task," al-Aloul adds. "We are also adamant in showing the atrocities that Israel is committing against us."

October 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Ten days of relentless bombing of Gaza by Israel has caused widespread destruction to schools and hospitals and displaced nearly a million people, with aid agencies warning of a "catastrophic" shortage of medical supplies in the besieged enclave.
Israel has justified its brutal assault in the wake of Hamas attacks on October 7 that left at least 1,300 Israelis dead. It has since cut off water, power and fuel supplies, trapping 2.3 million people.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) described the situation in Gaza as "abhorrent" as residents scramble for basic necessities such as food and water and struggle to get medical care in hospitals at the breaking point.
Israel has ordered 1.1 million people to move from the north to the south, causing panic and misery to tens of thousands in a territory that has been facing   due to 16 years of Israeli blockades.
Here's what we know about how recent Israeli attacks have made daily life in Gaza even more difficult:
Medical services
The United Kingdom-based Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) group says hospitals in Gaza are facing a 'catastrophic' shortage of medical supplies, amid Israel's 'total blockade'.
'Emergency, trauma and surgical supplies are rapidly running out at hospitals and health partners' warehouses, with the entry of humanitarian supplies still not possible,' MAP's advocacy and campaigns manager in the West Bank, Aseel Baidoun, told Al Jazeera.
'There is a shortage of blood. Medicine is in short supply.'
Suffering from a Gaza-wide power outage, hospitals are running on external generators – a backup that is   towards its last few hours, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
This would place thousands of patients at  , many of them already straddling the line between life and death such as kidney and cancer patients.
Currently, 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza cannot access health facilities as several hospitals have been bombed, according to the UN Population Fund.
Newborns in incubators at hospital are also at   if power runs out, according to Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC's regional director for the Near and Middle East.
'The hospital can't operate much longer. The electricity is still off. The hospital's fuel-based generators will be going off soon. The health system will collapse. The hospital will change to a graveyard," Mohamed Kandil, director of the emergency department at Nasser Hospital,  .
Kandil added that the hospital, situated in Khan Younis, was receiving a new patient every minute following an already continuous flow of patients over the past week.
There is a shortage of body bags for the dead, according to UNRWA, and people have resorted to storing dead bodies in  .
Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for Gaza's health ministry, appealed to people to head to the Shifa Hospital, the largest in the enclave, to donate blood.
"If the hospital stops working, the whole world will be responsible for the lives of hundreds and thousands of patients who rely on our services, especially from Shifa," said al-Qidra.
Since 7 October, WHO has documented 111 attacks on health care.
12 health workers have been killed on duty.

- WHO in occupied Palestinian territory (@WHOoPt) October 15, 2023
The World Health Organization (WHO) said hospitals are "overflowing" as people seek safety.
Direct damage through air strikes has been inflicted on 24 health facilities, including six hospitals, while 15 health workers have been killed, another 27 injured, and 23 ambulances have been damaged, according to WHO.
Another 23 governmental and NGO facilities that are only partially operational are treating an average of 1,000 patients a day – well beyond their capacity, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
Gaza's health sector was already crumbling under years of Israeli occupation. According to the World Bank, Gaza has 1.3 hospital beds for every 1,000 people – as compared to 3.3. per 1,000 in Israel.
Concerns about the spread of epidemics are rising due to the influx of people in hospitals while children there are already contracting smallpox, according to UNRWA .
Food
UNRWA said that nearly half a million people have been unable to   rations due to the closure of their food distribution centres since the start of Israeli attacks on October 7.
'People spend their days looking for water and some basic foodstuffs, mostly bread and rice," said Safwat Kahout, an Al Jazeera producer in Gaza.
An OCHA report on Sunday warned that with only one of five mills functioning, wheat flour reserves may be depleted in less than a week.
Air strikes have also directly damaged livestock, especially poultry, and agricultural land.
Israel's closure of Karem Abu Salem crossing – the only commercial crossing, known to Israelis as Kerem Shalom – has also put a stop to the passage of animal feed for livestock.
Although farmers are unable to access their land, power outages mean that they cannot utilise the necessary irrigation, machinery, incubation devices, or refrigeration to salvage their crops.
Areas in the south such as Khan Younis are bearing the brunt of damage to agriculture.
With the current displacement and blockade, basic food supplies such as eggs, bread, and vegetables are severely short now, according to Euro-Med Monitor. Residents in Gaza have reported a scramble for available food, with children getting first priority.
Today, we entered the stage of children first. Fresh water is about to run out, so we made a plan to fairly distribute each person's share of water, and we gave priority to the kids.
Bread is enough for one day. The adults will have 'only one meal. Children first. https://t.co/SVy375K7iP

In a post shared to their X, formerly Twitter, account on Sunday, the World Food Programme (WFP) said that flights carrying 20 metric tonnes of their high-energy biscuits had landed near the Rafah border in Egypt, and were waiting for   so that they could deliver the emergency assistance to families.
Flights carrying 20 metric tons of @WFP  high-energy biscuits are landing in Al-Arish airport near the #Rafah  border in #Egypt  to address the pressing food shortages in #Gaza .

Gaza had already been experiencing high levels of   under Israeli occupation. Sixty-three percent of the population of 1.84 million people have been food insecure, according to the WFP.
Drinking water
Drinking water has become even   in Gaza.
Kahout reported that families were going around for hours, water bottles in hand, to search for water.
When people do find water, it is primarily through private vendors who are operating small desalination and water purification plants, mainly on   energy.
Others have to resort to drinking brackish water from agricultural wells, according to OCHA. This is triggering concerns about waterborne diseases such as cholera.
Reports on Gaza's drinking water in recent years have shown that it has mostly remained  .
A June report by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) stated that 96 percent of water is not fit for human consumption, leading most families to buy water from street vendors at a high cost – an added burden for a population where every second resident is poor, according to the World Bank .
Sanitation
On Sunday, OCHA said that Gaza's last functioning seawater desalination plant had shut down due to fuel running out, while water and sanitation facilities, water wells, reservoirs, and pumping stations have   due to the incessant air strikes.
Spiking water pollution could dramatically increase kidney problems in the Gaza Strip, which already experiences a 13-14 percent increase in the number of kidney patients each year, according to Oxfam.
Israel reported that on Sunday that it was resuming water supplies to a line that is serving Khan Younis – one of the major areas to which people from north Gaza have moved. However, officials so far have stated that   has reached south Gaza.
Residents in Gaza have also noted that this would not have actual impact since water pipes have been destroyed by Israeli air strikes and residents traditionally need to fill up tanks to access water. Without fuel, residents cannot operate trucks needed to transport water or pump it.
I am from Gaza and I am telling you this is a JOKE.
Israel destroyed many water pipes.
Also, without electricity we can NOT turn on the water pumps.
Water in Gaza does not simply run into the taps. We have to fill water tanks about twice a week. https://t.co/yu7iyPsTOc
- Refaat (@itranslate123) October 15, 2023
Gaza's last remaining operational wastewater treatment plant also shut down on Sunday, causing additional amounts of untreated sewage to be discharged to the sea, according to OCHA.
Sewage and solid waste has also been accumulating in the streets and posing health and environmental risks since most of the 65 sewage pumping stations have stopped operating without fuel.
Housing
Living in one of the most densely populated areas in the world, Gaza residents are further being pushed to a corner.
Israeli air strikes and evacuation orders have displaced an estimated 600,000 people to the southern half of Gaza, with almost 400,000 of them crowding into UNRWA emergency shelters. These numbers have likely increased significantly since the October 14 count, according to UNRWA, and are likely to create breeding grounds for disease.
"Large numbers of people are taking shelter here and in schools in total disorder, and no hygiene. It will cause epidemics across Gaza and beyond," Muhammad Abu Salamiya at Shifa Hospital told Al Jazeera.
As of October 13, at least 7,000 housing units have been destroyed while another 4,887 are uninhabitable, according to the Gaza Ministry of Public Works.
Displaced people are staying in public facilities or with host families. Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed, who herself was staying in a 100m apartment with a host family, said that people in the south were hosting at least two to three other families in their homes, even families that they did not personally know.
But the housing crisis in Gaza does not end there. Many displaced people, including vulnerable individuals such as pregnant women, the injured, and children, are sleeping outdoors.

How big is Israel's military and how much funding does it get from the US?

Israel is continuing to bombard the besieged Gaza Strip for a fifth day in a row in the wake of a deadly attack on Saturday by the Palestinian group Hamas.
The latest death toll stands at   killed in Gaza and 1,200 people killed in Israel.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is expected to travel to Israel, said Washington will give its 'full support' to Israel, with guided-missile carriers and F-35 fighters among the  .
In addition, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced on   that Washington is sending multiple military ships and the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, as a show of force to its closest ally in the region.
Maintaining Israel's regional military hegemony is a core element of the United States' Middle East policy. This has been achieved by US funding and an increasing Israeli military arsenal.
Here is what you need to know about Israel's military and how it is funded.
Israel's military at a glance
Israel operates a vast military apparatus. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies' (IISS) Military Balance 2023, Israel has 169,500 active military personnel in the army, navy and paramilitary. A further 465,000 constitute its reserve forces, while 8,000 form part of its paramilitary.
Some   are now stationed near the Gaza Strip, a military spokesman said on Wednesday amid fears of a possible ground operation.
Military service is mandatory for citizens over the age of 18 – once enlisted, men are expected to serve for 32 months and women for 24 months.
Israel has one of the most powerful militaries in the Middle East with advanced surveillance and weapons. Included in its extensive military arsenal are:
(Al Jazeera)
Personnel
169,500 active military personnel
465,000 reserve forces
Land power
2,200+ tanks
530 artillery (SP, Towed, MRL, MOR)
Airpower
339 combat capable aircraft including 309 fighter ground attack jets
196 F-16 jets
83 F-15 jets
30 F-35 jets
142 helicopters
43 Apache attack helicopters
Naval power
5 submarines
49 patrol and coastal combatants
Israel's Iron Dome system is a mobile air defence system designed to intercept and destroy short-range rockets using radar technology. It was developed in 2006, following the war with Hezbollah, where thousands of rockets were launched into Israel.
Coming into operation in 2011, the Iron Dome was created with the help of the US which is responsible for supplying parts for the system including setting aside more than $1.5bn in missile defence for Israel in 2022.
According to the IISS, Israel's Iron Dome system intercepted more than 90 percent of rockets fired from Hamas and other Palestinian groups in 2021.
Israel is also believed to hold nuclear capabilities, according to the IISS, which states that the country possesses Jericho missiles and aircraft capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
How much does Israel spend on its military?
In 2022, Israel spent $23.4bn on its military, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a research institute focused on conflict and armaments.
This amounts to $2,535 per capita over the 2018-2022 period, making it the world's second-largest spender on military per capita after Qatar.
In 2022, Israel dedicated 4.5 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to the military, the 10th highest percentage in the world.
Which countries buy the most Israeli weapons?
Historically, Israel's weapons imports have far outweighed its exports. However, during the last decade, exports have begun to consistently eclipse imports, SIPRI data shows.
Between 2018 and 2022, at least 35 countries imported weapons from Israel totalling $3.2bn.
Of that, about a third ($1.2bn), of Israel's military exports were to India. Relations between Israel and India have blossomed since Indian Prime Minister Narendra came to power in 2014.
The second-largest buyer of Israeli weapons was Azerbaijan ($295m), followed by the Philippines ($275m), the US ($217m) and Vietnam ($180m).
In the period between 2018-2022, Israel imported weapons totalling $2.7bn from only two countries, the US and Germany.
More than three-quarters of Israel's military imports amounting to $2.1bn came from the US while the remaining $546m came from Germany.
The US and Israeli militaries cooperate closely with joint exercises, technology development programmes and defence projects, with the latter being the largest recipient of US military aid.
How much military aid has Israel received from the US?
Israel is the most significant recipient of US foreign aid, having received some $263bn between 1946 and 2023.
This is almost double (1.7 times more) than the second-highest recipient of US foreign aid, Egypt, which received $151.9bn in the past 77 years.
Israel has long been seen by US legislators as an ally to help protect US strategic interests in the Middle East.
According to the US Congressional Research Service, factors for the continuing military support to Israel include shared strategic interests, 'domestic US support for Israel' and 'a mutual commitment to democratic values'.
US military funding to Israel topped $3.8bn in 2023, as part of a record $38bn deal over 10 years signed under former US President Barack Obama in 2016.
Between 1946 and 2023, the US has supported Israel with a total of $124bn in the form of military and defence aid.
Of the $3.8bn military aid provided to Israel this year, half a billion has been for Israel's missile defences. Washington has stated that it will backfill Israeli munitions used against Hamas in the latest war.
Hours after the deadly Hamas attack inside Israel, it requested Iron Dome interceptors from the US, with President Joe Biden stating that Washington 'will be rapidly providing the Israel Defence Forces with additional equipment and resources, including munitions', which are scheduled to arrive within days.
The Biden administration is expected to set aside more money for Tel Aviv through a funding request to Congress. However, with the absence of a House speaker there could be a delay in congressional authorisation for such aid.
The US imposes conditions on how aid, particularly military aid, can be used. The Leahy Law prohibits the export of US defence articles to military units complicit in human rights abuses.
However, no Israeli unit has been penalised under this law.
Military aid to Israel greatly increased after the 1967 war when Israel defeated neighbouring Arab armies and began occupying the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.

The US Navy has dispatched a guided-missile submarine to the Middle East.
The posting was revealed by the military in an announcement late on Sunday. The unusual revelation regarding the location of the ship, which can launch nuclear missiles, suggests a show of force intended to try to contain regional tensions amid the Israel-Hamas war.
'On November 5, 2023, an Ohio-class submarine arrived in the US Central Command area of responsibility', US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter. The Central Command area includes the Middle East.
The post by the Department of Defence unit appeared to show an image of the submarine moving through the Suez Canal.

Since the war broke out on October 7 between Hamas and Israel, the United States' closest regional ally, Washington has moved  significant military assets to the region, including two aircraft carriers and extensive fighter aircraft.
It has also announced the deployment of around 1,000 American soldiers, and the engagement of an unspecified number of special operations commandos, who are 'advising' the Israeli military in their Gaza operations.
In addition, Washington has taken steps to beef up the defences of its Gulf allies, with a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system destined for Saudi Arabia and Patriot surface-to-air missile systems to be sent to Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Pat Ryder said the build-up was aimed at deterring regional escalation and protecting the US and its partners.
'Since that Hamas terrorist attack we've also been crystal clear that we do not want to see the situation in Israel widen into a broader regional conflict,' said Ryder in an October 24 press briefing. "And as you've heard President Biden, Secretary Austin and other senior US leaders say, our message to any country or group thinking about trying to take advantage of this situation to widen the conflict is don't."
Secretary of State Antony Blinken travelled on Sunday for talks with regional leaders, including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in Baghdad.
US military assets have come under heavy fire from Iran-allied militias in Syria and Iraq, since October 7. During this time, such groups have waged dozens of attacks at US bases, with the most severe wounding 21 US military personnel in al-Tanf garrison in Syria and Al Asad Air Base in Iraq on October 17 and 18.

An unexpected friendship: The graveyard keeper and the polio survivor

November 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Lampedusa, Italy – The tourist season has ended and the cafes along Via Roma are almost empty.
Until a few weeks ago, Lampedusa's main street was full of tourists, sitting at the hundreds of cafe tables that lined the pedestrian walkway. But now that winter is coming, most of the tables have been removed, and most people have left.
For Michele Cappadona and Vincenzo Lombardo, two friends who have been meeting here for the past 30 years, the quiet isn't unusual. On a warm and windy afternoon, with the wind blowing in from the south, they take their seats outside a bar and begin their usual commentary on the news.
"Michele, did you hear about Palestine and Israel?" Vincenzo asks.
"Oh, I don't know, Vince. Always something bad around the corner," Michele replies.
"Poor them. Children, innocent souls," Vincenzo says before declaring of both the Hamas fighters who attacked communities in southern Israel on October 7 and the Israeli military which has responded by attacking and invading the Gaza Strip: "They are all criminals, assassins."
These are words Vincenzo has repeated many times over the years, usually to critique people in power he blames for not doing enough to stop human suffering.
When they first met more than 30 years ago, Vincenzo was a strong working man in his 40s with a deep Christian faith. Michele was in his 20s; smaller, lame as a result of childhood polio and with a rather more cynical perspective on religion.

Born on the island in 1959, Michele moved to Naples as a one-year-old when his parents discovered he had polio. He stayed there, living in a specialist clinic, at first with his parents and then by himself, until he was a teenager and the doctors declared that his treatment had come to an end. In 1975, he returned to Lampedusa to live with his parents and complete his secondary school education.
He remembers first spotting Vincenzo a few years later from the window of his room. Vincenzo had recently returned from Turin, where he had been working at the Fiat car company, and started working as a dustman.
Michele would "see him every morning". Then, one day, he says, "We met somehow". He thinks it was at a cafe, but he cannot recall which one.
"Vince, do you remember where we met the first time?" Michele asks, repeating the question more loudly for his friend who is now almost deaf.
"Oh, I see," Vincenzo finally answers. "I don't know, it must have been somewhere, maybe at the Amicizia cafe? Anyway, who cares? It doesn't matter."
"I only remember that we liked each other," Michele says with a smile. "It was a very spontaneous thing. And the next day or the day after, we decided to meet again. Since then, we have been meeting here, in Via Roma, pretty much every day. There it is. This is our story. As simple as that."
Michele, who has never had a job and receives a modest disability pension, says his whole life has been lived in the shadow of his disability. Before he met Vincenzo, he says, he felt as though he was living on the margins of society. "People, you know, how they are. Always judging," he says. "They see one who cannot work or use his strength as they do, and they turn their back to you. But Vincenzo was different. He didn't care about that."
In death, 'we are all the same'
In 1996, Vincenzo took a job as a graveyard keeper. When he accepted the role, he had little idea that he would have to bury the bodies of people who had died at sea while  . But soon after he started, bodies started to be found off the island's shores.
Nobody knew what to do with the first bodies that were retrieved. With no formal processing system in place, Vincenzo stepped in to take care of them. "What did Jesus say? What you do to my brother, you do it to me," he says.

He continued doing this up until his retirement in 2007, writing whatever information he could find about the migrants and refugees he buried in a register.
The oldest document the registry office in   has is dated April 25, 1996, and identifies the deceased as an "unknown non-EU citizen, possibly Tunisian, between 25 and 30 years old, wearing a ring with the initial letter of his name. His name was Mustafa."
Vincenzo tried to give the dead he buried some dignity by making wooden crosses that he would erect, adding a number according to his own records and praying for the deceased every day.
He complains that Europe has shown no serious intention of stopping refugees and migrants from dying at sea or of providing "any dignity to the dead and their families".
One thing he is grateful for, however, is that he never had to bury a child who had died at sea. "I think that I would have given up," he says.
The anger Vincenzo feels towards those in power is palpable. He calls it a "travesty" that the world has normalised a situation where thousands of people are left to die in the Mediterranean. "Governments do not care about their lives. Nobody cares," he says.
For Vincenzo, the living may be treated very differently, but in death, we are "all the same".

The view from the end of the road
From one end of Via Roma, Michele and Vincenzo watch the coastguard or Guardia di Finanza (Italy's antismuggling agency) boats approaching the Favaloro pier, where most small boat landings take place in Lampedusa.
From this spot, they have a clear view and notice some rescue boats in the distance, full of people wrapped in thermic blankets.
"Do you think this is right?" Michele asks. "Crammed like that? And how many are still dying? Yesterday, or the day before, six died."
These days, such deaths no longer make it to the global news. Nor is there much coverage of the refugees and migrants who do make it to shore or of the conditions they endure at the "welcome" centre where they are detained.
Michele and Vincenzo are not particularly surprised by this. They have become used to observing how the world's attention shifts so easily from one tragedy to the next.
"It is always the same. They come, they talk, and they leave. But no worries, at least we stay here to watch these awful situations," Vincenzo says.

A never-ending story
In September, Lampedusa did hit the front pages again – albeit fleetingly. National and international newspapers wrote about an "invasion" of thousands of refugees and migrants  .
The number of people who landed in Lampedusa had reached 5,000 or 6,000 in a few days, according to the humanitarian organisations working inside the island's "reception centre".
"Yes, they were all there, at the dock.  . There, without water and food," Michele says, describing how people were left to lie on the pavement under the hot sun. When most of the refugees and migrants were transferred elsewhere in Sicily, the news reporters went away.
But Vincenzo and Michele remain, watching and talking as they have for the past 30 years."You will always find us here … For as long as we are on this Earth," Michele explains. Then they return to their earlier conversation, debating the Israel-Palestine conflict.
"They talk about peace. Peace, how to make peace if they keep bombing and playing at war?" Michele says. "And then, can you imagine how many more will come? How many more immigrants? This story will never end, it will never end."
It is almost 6pm and Vincenzo has pills to take. So the two friends say goodbye. They will meet again the next day to continue their conversation.
"You know how it is," says Michele with a resigned shrug of his shoulders. "There is the good and the bad, but the bad always wins. Because that one is stronger than the other, and it will always be."

US House chaos continues as Jim Jordan readies for second speaker bid

October 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The US House of Representatives is entering its third week with no leader after right-wing Republicans ousted the former speaker, leaving the body unable to take action on key issues including the wars in Ukraine and Israel-Palestine.
Former House Speaker McCarthy was   on October 3 after angering far-right members of his own party by partnering with Democrats to pass a debt ceiling bill that narrowly averted a government shutdown.
Ever since, the fiercely divided House, which requires a majority vote from present members to select its leader, has been unable to coalesce around a new speaker. The   means it likely cannot pass bills or greenlight resolutions needed to direct aid overseas.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican from Georgia, said the picture looks dire and advocated awarding more powers to Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry to ease the crisis.
'We can't sit around and suck our thumbs and hope the world will wait until the House Republicans get their act together,' he told Fox News.

On Tuesday, right-wing Republican Jim Jordan fell short in his first bid for the position by 17 votes, with 20 of his own party members defecting . All 212 Democrats in the body cast their ballots for their party's Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.
Jordan is set to push forward with a second bid for the leadership role on Wednesday, but it remains unclear if he has built up enough additional support to come out on top.
At least one Republican who voted against Jordan on Tuesday, Representative Doug LaMalfa, agreed to support his bid in the second round, but that would still leave him far short of the 17 additional votes he needs. The House was set to convene at 11:00am EST (15:00 GMT) for the vote.
Jordan, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee who was endorsed by former US President Donald Trump, will be expected to show significant progress. But the holdouts appear to be dug in.
Jordan's Republican opponents met after voting against him and nearly all reaffirmed their objections, with some predicting he could lose another 10 Republicans.
The Ohio lawmaker has little of the goodwill among the rank and file that McCarthy spent years cultivating, and it is unlikely that they would indulge him in the 15 rounds of voting that it took to get his predecessor elected.
There is momentum behind a push to appoint caretaker Speaker McHenry for a limited period – expanding his purely ceremonial powers so that he can bring legislation to the floor.
Lawmakers are expected to vote on a motion to formally elect McHenry – probably until the end of the year or until a permanent speaker is elected – if the second speaker vote doesn't go Jordan's way.
"After two weeks without a speaker of the House and no clear candidate with 217 votes in the Republican conference, it is time to look at other viable options," Ohio congressman Dave Joyce said in a statement reported by the political newspaper The Hill.
"By empowering Patrick McHenry as Speaker Pro Tempore we can take care of our ally Israel until a new Speaker is elected."

Analysis: Fallout from Israel meeting shows militia power in Libya

September 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Last month's meeting between   may ultimately achieve little but provide public justification for renewed fighting between Tripoli's armed groups and the weakening, perhaps critically, of Libya's interim prime minister,  , analysts have said.
Since emerging from the ashes of the country's 2011 revolution, Libya's many militias have maintained a series of uneasy alliances with the country's shifting leadership, who rely upon the armed groups to project power across the 1.8 million square kilometres ( nearly 700,000 square miles) of oil-rich territory.
While the eastern parallel government in Benghazi has experienced some success in corralling its armed groups into the fold of the Libyan National Army militia, its western rivals in Tripoli – who are recognised by the United Nations – have enjoyed significantly less success.
Tensions, often deadly, between militias are commonplace for those living within Tripoli, with the fault lines between rival groups uncertain.
Overseeing it all, at least on paper, is Dbeibah's government, in power in Tripoli since the failed elections of December 2021 and one whose every policy must weigh the self-interests of the militias responsible for carrying them out.
Conflict broke out as recently as August, with many of the same armed groups now seizing upon the Israeli meeting to push agendas only tangentially related to the meeting itself.
At stake is power, influence and control.
"The militias predate Dbeibah, they're confident they'll exist long after him," said Jalel Harchaoui of the Royal United Services Institute. "There's no need for any great vision. They've learned that the long term is really just a series of short terms."
"Since their inception, they've become institutionalised. They've become part of the state, its services, its intelligence, everything," he added.
Tensions with Zawiya
Maintaining the precarious balance of power with the militias, while negotiating with the rival government in Benghazi, dominated by General Khalifa Haftar, was always going to be a tricky proposition for Dbeibah, an interim prime minister under international pressure to help bring around some kind of democratic resolution to Libya.
For Dbeibah, facing pressure from allies in the United States and Italy and keen to normalise a personal mandate now long beyond its sell-by date, authorising the Israeli meeting, as he is suspected of having done, may have seemed an obvious political choice.
However, by  , Israel essentially threw petrol onto a long-simmering fire.
As protests broke out – for the most part, a genuine expression of sincere sympathies for the Palestinian cause – Libya's militias are thought to have spied opportunity amidst the confusion, with groups from the western city of Zawiya being the first to add their numbers to the throng in the capital.
"A lot of people were streaming down from Zawiya after news of the meeting broke," Tarek Megerisi, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said.
In May, Dbeibah had ordered drone strikes on armed groups in Zawiya following weeks of escalating tension.
The strikes were justified by the government as targeting people smugglers and traffickers. But they equally served as both a reminder of Tripoli's military prowess, as well as a warning of Dbeibah's reach to the Abu Zariba brothers, Ali, an MP affiliated with the Tripoli government, and Hassan, the local Zawiya leader of another militia, the Stability Support Apparatus (SSA).
Shifting hierarchies
Since the destruction of Tripoli International Airport in 2014, access to the capital has only been possible via the military base at Mitiga, which had been adopted as the base for the Special Deterrence Forces (SDF) the previous year, giving the hardline militia control over all access into the country's capital and largest city.
With the opening of a new international airport slated for 2024, the SDF's pre-eminent role in the city's militia hierarchy stands to be fundamentally undermined. Other armed groups look ready to capitalise, not least the well-disciplined and heavily armed 444 Brigade.
Fighting between the two groups last broke out in August. During a little over 24 hours of fighting,  .
Ironically, among those who brokered a truce between the two groups was al-Kikli's SSA.
"If there is a protracted war between these groups within the city, the human tragedy and infrastructure destruction could be immense," Harchaoui said.
Already, Harchaoui said, the capital's various militias, some religiously inspired, others with components dating back to former leader Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence services, are allying with their preferred candidate, typically based upon cynical calculations over how they see the conflict unfolding, or how it might impact their prestige or structural leverage.
Normalisation hypocrisy
Given the circumstances, efforts to establish Dbeibah as an international statesman by encouraging normalisation with Israel may have been ill-advised.
Nevertheless, the August meeting is not the first time a Libyan politician has met an Israeli official to discuss normalisation.
"Everyone's hands are dirty," Megerisi said. "Aguila Saleh [the speaker of Libya's eastern-based parliament] is walking around with his Palestinian flag and, rightly, being ridiculed. Libyans aren't thick. A few years ago we remember him encouraging his foreign minister – when he had a foreign minister – to seek normalisation with Israel."
Two years before that, Saddam Haftar, Khalifa's son, was reportedly in Tel Aviv to discuss normalising diplomatic relations in return for Israeli military technology.
There is little doubt that the present furore has fundamentally undermined Dbeibah, potentially even permanently. However, Megerisi cautioned, it is important to set the current crisis against the background of recent unrest, ranging from drone strikes, internecine fighting, kidnappings and the arbitrary arrests of prominent individuals.
"These aren't isolated incidents. They're more about the mafia-style negotiations between the two men [ahead of a future government], with Dbeibah signalling to Haftar that he can't strongarm him in the way he did with his predecessor, Fayez al-Sarraj," Megresi concluded.
Knowing the instability on the ground, the involvement of both Italy and the United States in Libya's external affairs was "the worst diplomatic failure in years," said German journalist Mirco Keilberth, who has lived and reported from Libya since the 2011 revolution. "They don't have elections, they don't have any unified system of law, but Italy and the US think they can push them towards normalising relations with Israel? It's the wrong moment for such a strategy."

US says Iran 'actively facilitating' attacks on bases in Middle East

The United States has accused Iran of "actively facilitating" rocket and drone attacks by Iranian-backed proxy groups on its forces in Iraq and Syria.
John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, said on Monday the US would not allow threats to interests "go unchallenged" after an uptick in   over the last week as tensions rise across the region amid the  .
The US has thrown its weight behind Israel over the latter's   on the Gaza Strip, prompted by an unprecedented attack by the Palestinian group Hamas on October 7. The US has rejected calls for a ceasefire as it says that ally Israel has a right to self-defence.
"Iran continues to support Hamas and Hezbollah, and we know that Iran is closely monitoring these events and, in some cases, actively facilitating these attacks and spurring on others who may want to exploit the conflict for their own good or for that of Iran," Kirby told reporters at the White House.
"We know Iran's goal is to maintain some level of deniability here, but we are not going to allow them to do that," Kirby said, confirming that the US has sent a "few" military advisers to Israel with experience in "the sorts of operations that Israel is conducting, and may conduct in the future".
There was no immediate comment by the Iranian government.
Iran politically backs Hamas as well as the Lebanese movement Hezbollah and Shia groups in Iraq, but rejects giving military support to these groups.
In recent days, Iranian leaders have warned that a ground Israeli offensive on Gaza would be met with a response from other fronts.
'If the crimes of the Zionist [Israeli] regime continue, Muslims and resistance forces will become impatient, and no one can stop them,' Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last week. 'The bombardment of Gaza must stop immediately.'
Until the flareup in violence, President Joe Biden's administration had hailed a period of relative calm with pro-Iranian fighters in the region and the dialogue between the two sides.
However, since Wednesday, multiple rocket and drone attacks have   three Iraqi military bases across the Middle East where US troops are stationed as part of the international coalition set up to fight the ISIL (ISIS) group.
On Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, told reporters that Tehran 'neither gives orders to the resistance groups across the region, nor stop them from taking decisions in their own countries based on their own interests'.
According to Amirabdollahian, the US has sent messages to Iran to say it does not want the scope of the war to expand, and it wants Tehran to show restraint and also ask others who may wish to militarily respond to show restraint.
'Mr. Biden, stop your hypocrisy. Is this your election campaign promises of supporting human rights across the globe?'
The US administration has sent   for Israel in the past two weeks, including two aircraft carriers, other warships and about 2,000 marines in the Middle East.
Washington has also promised major defence aid to Israel since Hamas's attack that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
In Gaza, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health says  , most of them civilians, have been killed during Israel's relentless air raids that destroyed entire neighbourhoods.

Death and disease as Israeli troops approach Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital

November 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Medics have warned of mounting casualties among patients, including newborn babies, and concern of spreading disease is growing, as Israeli forces approach the gates of al-Shifa, Gaza City's main hospital.
Besieged for days by Israel's military, doctors inside the hospital reiterated on Monday that the lack of fuel for electricity generators is leaving them unable to save patients. Israel has refused to back down, claiming that the hospital hides a Hamas base.
Fighting has been concentrated in a tightening circle around the Gaza Strip's largest hospital, where thousands of civilians have sought shelter.
The Israeli military, whose ground forces entered the Strip in late October and quickly encircled the north's main settlement Gaza City, has said that al-Shifa is the primary target in its battle to seize control of the northern half of the enclave.
Israel says that Hamas fighters have an underground headquarters in tunnels beneath the hospital and are deliberately using its patients as a shield, a claim that Hamas denies.
Reports on Monday suggested that thousands of people have fled the hospital. But huge numbers also remain trapped within.
At least 650 patients remain, as well as staff, said Gaza's Ministry of Health spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra, who was inside al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City
He said an Israel tank was stationed at the hospital gate.
"The tank is outside the gate of the outpatient clinic department, this is how the situation looks this morning," al-Qudra told the Reuters news agency by phone.
Israeli snipers and drones were firing into the hospital, making it impossible for medics and patients to move around, he added.
"We are besieged and are inside a circle of death," he said.
The official said that 32 patients had died in the past three days, including three newborn babies, as a result of the siege of the hospital and the cut-off of its power.
Nowhere to go
Israel has told civilians to leave and medics to send patients elsewhere.
It was unclear where they would go. Several hospitals and clinics in Gaza have been forced to shut down, while others are already working at full capacity with dwindling supplies. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have surrounded the facility.
Israel also claimed that it attempted to evacuate babies from al-Shifa's neonatal ward and left 300 litres (79 gallons) of fuel to power emergency generators at the hospital entrance, but that Hamas blocked the offer and prevented the hospital from using the fuel.
The Health Ministry spokesperson denied rejecting the fuel, adding that 300 litres would power the hospital for just half an hour.
Al-Shifa needed 8,000-10,000 litres (2,113-2,641 gallons) of fuel per day, which must be delivered by the Red Cross or an international aid agency, he told Reuters.
Medical Aid for Palestinians, a UK-based charity that has supported al-Shifa's neonatal intensive care unit, said transferring critically ill infants is complex.
'With ambulances unable to reach the hospital … and no hospital with capacity to receive them, there is no indication of how this can be done safely," CEO Melanie Ward said. She said the only option was to pause the fighting and allow in fuel.
The Gaza Health Ministry said that of 45 babies in incubators at al-Shifa, six had died as of Monday. Al-Qudra had no immediate update.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X that al-Shifa was "not functioning as a hospital anymore".
. @WHO  has managed to get in touch with health professionals at the Al-Shifa hospital in #Gaza .
The situation is dire and perilous.
It's been 3 days without electricity, without water and with very poor internet which has severely impacted our ability to provide essential
- Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) November 12, 2023
"Tragically, the number of patient fatalities has increased significantly," he said. "The world cannot stand silent while hospitals, which should be safe havens, are transformed into scenes of death, devastation, and despair."
Dr Alice Rothchild, from Jewish Voice for Peace, told Al Jazeera that diseases are "running rampant" inside Gaza's hospitals.
'A modern 21st-century hospital needs electricity and power to use all of its instruments and equipment. Without fuel, even the electric generators and ambulances cannot work,' she said.
'Think about the hospital personnel. The staff is exhausted, traumatised. Many of them are getting sick because there are contagious diseases that are now running rampant,' Dr Rothchild said.
'What's going to happen is that people are going to suffer, and some of them are going to die. They could die slowly with sepsis, infection or gangrene. And some are going to die suddenly when their respirator stops working,' she added.
Weeks of conflict
The more than monthlong conflict has polarised the world, with many countries saying that even the shocking brutality of the Hamas attacks on October 7 did not justify an Israeli response that has killed so many civilians in a crowded territory under siege.
Israel says it must destroy Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, and the blame for harm to civilians falls on fighters who intentionally hide among them.
It has rejected demands for a ceasefire, which it says would only prolong the suffering by giving Hamas a chance to regroup, a position supported by Washington, which nevertheless says it is pressing its ally to protect civilians.
"The United States does not want to see firefights in hospitals where innocent people, patients receiving medical care, are caught in the crossfire and we've had active consultations with the [Israeli army] on this," White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS News broadcaster.
Hundreds of thousands of civilians are believed to remain in the northern part of Gaza where the fighting is focused, despite Israel's order to leave. Israel has also regularly bombed the south, leaving Gaza Palestinians saying they have nowhere safe to go.
The order to leave the north amounted to a choice "whether to stay in your home, where your memories are and where you were born, and go to nowhere or be bombed", said Ahmed, 42, reached by phone in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.
"Most of the people in Jabalia didn't leave and they don't want to leave. Israel doesn't differentiate between north and south," he said.
In the south, Israeli planes bombed several houses in Khan Younis. In one strike, health officials said seven people were killed and several wounded.
At Nasser hospital, people in private cars brought casualties including children to the emergency department.
"There are dead bodies under the rubble, we need ambulances," one of the men cried.

Analysis: Israel's 'war on hospitals' vs Hamas military exaggerations

The past week of Israel's land incursions into Gaza can be called a 'war on hospitals'. Most of Israel's military activities in the last few days appear directed at or around the medical facilities in Gaza City.
On Wednesday morning, the Israeli army  , the Gaza Strip's largest, after surrounding it for several days, targeting its compounds and their immediate surroundings, and according to doctors inside, firing occasionally, using snipers. On Tuesday, the Gaza health ministry said at least 40 people had been killed at the hospital.
The Israeli side insists that the Qassam Brigades of Hamas have underground command centres or other facilities under some of Gaza's hospitals.   strongly refutes that claim.
Palestinian and international medical staff and aid organisations are desperately demanding a halt to the attacks and for medical supplies, water and fuel to be urgently delivered to the hospitals.
In modern warfare, there is usually some neutral body on the ground that can act as an intermediary between the warring parties. Even enemies need to talk, arrange local ceasefires to evacuate dead and wounded, exchange prisoners of war and let civilians out. Talks at higher levels, direct or through intermediaries, often happen at a neutral venue away from the battlefield. Qatar and other countries are playing key roles in   between Israel and Hamas, but there is always a need to communicate on the ground as well.
Often that task is undertaken by the International Red Cross or Red Crescent, whose representatives, experienced and usually very tight-lipped, have helped alleviate much suffering in past conflicts. Yet, despite the presence of several trusted organisations there seems to have been no attempt made by Israel to have them confirm or deny the existence of such military facilities in those unfortunate hospitals.
I was able to examine commercial satellite images of the area of recent Israeli operations in northern Gaza and, despite their fairly low resolution — which often makes accurate identification of fine detail impossible — they reveal many interesting facts.
They clearly confirm that Israel attacked in three columns. Two of them, roughly of equal strength, each with 200-300 vehicles of all types, advanced along the main axes. One drove south from Israel along the coast, covering up to 2km (1.2 miles) in width to reach  . The head of that column has now reached the last open ground before the Shati refugee camp.
The second main column cut across the Strip south of Gaza City. When it reached the sea, it turned north along the coast and has now stopped and dug in just before the harbour. Elements of this column advanced into the area leading up to al-Shifa Hospital and have now entered the medical facility.
The third, smaller, column moved in from the Erez checkpoint towards Beit Hanoon. Unlike the two main forces whose basic job was to take ground and clear Hamas fighters from it, this group seems to have had two purposes: to deny Hamas the possibility to flank the main columns, move around them and attack from the sides, and also to draw fighters to an additional open-ground front. It has reached the first houses of Gaza City proper and is now positioned there.
Analysing satellite photos taken over the last five days, there appears to have been very little movement: Positioning within the areas taken rather than significant advances.
Most of the Israeli companies appear to have reached their current positions by last Friday and, except for those involved in action around the al-Shifa Hospital, now appear to be waiting for the next stage. They are dug in and encamped in a similar fashion: armed vehicles with their backs to buildings that have obviously been cleared of tenants and occupied by the Israeli army, with as much open area in front of them as possible to deter Hamas incursions.
In addition to these three attack columns, satellites show a large group of vehicles inside Israel, close to Nahal Oz, one of the sites of the Hamas attack on October 7.
The fact that this battle group has not moved at all since deploying confirms it to be the strategic reserve, a force that stays close to the battlefield ready to dash forward if needed. Usually, it races into battle when a major unit encounters difficulties and needs to be helped out, or when reconnaissance shows a sudden opportunity — a sector where enemy defences are weak so that a surprise decisive attack may be successful.
What about Hamas so far?
Hard as it is to determine the extent of its fighting and tactics, as evidence is scant, a number of videos released showed that Palestinian fighters chose tactics appropriate to the situation on the ground. They have avoided fighting in open terrain where they stood little chance, and tried to conserve strength for the next phase.
When Israelis move into the cobweb of narrow streets in dense urban areas, Hamas soldiers will be able to use the terrain to their advantage,   and the damaged and mostly empty buildings.
While obviously holding off their main attack, Hamas fighters have not just been sitting and waiting. Even in open ground, often using the cover of vegetation and farm buildings, they have taken every opportunity to fire their arsenal at the advancing Israelis.
Still, Hamas's claims of the number of Israeli vehicles destroyed appear grossly exaggerated. On Saturday, November 11, a spokesman for the Qassam Brigades claimed 160 military vehicles from the two columns that advanced from the north border of Gaza had been destroyed 'totally or partially,' including 25 in the 48 hours prior to the announcement.
As often happens with military statements, it's largely a question of semantics.
While 'totally destroyed vehicle' is self-explanatory, the term 'partially destroyed' is vague and contradictory and befits propaganda rather than factual reporting. The devil is always in the detail: It is entirely possible that 160 Israeli military vehicles, armoured and soft-skinned, have been hit in the land invasion. The problem is how many of them were dead after the attacks.
'Destroyed' may be great for propaganda, but not for soldiers. They need a term to denote that something cannot continue to be used and cannot be (easily) repaired, especially not on the spot. For anything that cannot continue to be used as intended, with full operational capability, militaries use 'incapacitated'.
Combat vehicles' incapacitation can be temporary, a small malfunction that can be dealt with at the first opportunity and with local resources, repaired in the field within hours. More serious incapacitation would lead to the vehicle being driven or towed out of the battle theatre, to be treated at a repair depot inside Israel.
If a vehicle is beyond repair, it often gets destroyed by its own side, burned or blown up, so that the enemy cannot make use of it or remove any useful parts.
Satellite photography does not show many hulks, and the number of Israeli soldiers killed in battle so far, reported to be 48 as of Wednesday morning, suggests the number of truly destroyed vehicles is much lower than Hamas claims.

Keeping Gaza online: Telecom heroes risk life and limb under Israel's bombs

November 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
It was a little after 10 pm when Ahmad* was called by the Network Operation Centre at the Palestine Telecommunications Company (PalTel). It was the third week of Israel's assault on Gaza and the main data centre in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City had lost power, threatening to shut off all communications in the area.
To check on the centre, the PalTel electrician would have to make his way across the city during intense Israeli aerial bombardment, putting his life in danger. But he did not hesitate. He flagged down a passing ambulance, hoping it would provide him with a degree of safety from Israeli attacks.
'I told the driver that if I could not restore the generator, people like him wouldn't be able to reach injured civilians. We are no better nor less important than medical staff - a phone call can save lives,' Ahmad said.
Once at the centre, Ahmad set to work. By 2am, he had repaired the generator, allowing the telecommunications network to keep operating. He decided to stay in the building until dawn, slipping out around the freshly fallen debris to go home during a lull in Israeli bombing.
'Thank God my family was OK and I lived to see another day. This is my work and my life. I do this every day,' he said.
Ahmad's tale has become almost routine among the 750 PalTel staff in Gaza who, despite living through bombing, displacement and death, risk life and limb to keep the telecoms network running.
The cost of keeping Gaza connected has been high. At least five PalTel staff members in Gaza have been killed in Israeli attacks while many other staff members have lost family members, including wives and children.

Samir*, one of the staff members killed, had spent 10 hours shuttling fuel between data towers before returning home. Just 15 minutes later, Samir and his brother were killed in an Israeli air raid on their building.
Humanitarian workers and journalists have said the operation of communication networks in Gaza is essential for rescue services and for documenting the reality of conditions on the ground to the outside world.
More than 13,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. Videos of desperate family members and civil defence scrabbling through the rubble of bombed-out buildings to rescue civilians trapped underneath have inspired shock and horror the world over.
Preparing for war
On the first day of its offensive on Gaza on October 7, Israel cut electricity to the territory. Despite the lack of power and the constant bombing, Gaza's telecoms network stayed operational for almost six weeks.
The CEO of PalTel said this is because the company has been preparing for war for 'over 15 years', embedding emergency contingencies in its Gaza infrastructure at every step.
'We have faced a lot of different incidents during the previous wars. We're doing more protection than any other operator,' CEO Abdul Majeed Melhem told Al Jazeera.
PalTel's Gaza network was built during Israel's siege of the enclave, which requires that each piece of equipment be approved by Israeli authorities before entering Gaza, making repairs difficult.
Recurrent wars on Gaza and frequent bombing campaigns by Israel have damaged civilian infrastructure, so to brace itself for a sustained conflict like the current one, the telecoms network is built like no other.

While most telecom networks bury their cables 60cm (about 2ft) underground, PalTel buries its cables up to 8 metres (26ft) deep. In case the Israelis cut off electricity, its data centres in Gaza also have three layers of redundancy: generators, solar panels and batteries.
The company has also developed emergency protocols to direct workers remotely from the occupied West Bank, and if severed communications make this impossible, Gazan staff are empowered to act autonomously.
Despite all the redundancies and preparations, the sheer scale of bombings these past weeks has still crippled the network. About 70 percent of the mobile network has been taken offline. Solar panels have been rendered mostly useless either by being destroyed in attacks or covered in dust and debris.
The relentless nature of the conflict is also weighing on staff, who are dogged by danger from their house to the field.
Rabih*, a fibre optics technician, was called to repair a cable just metres from the border on October 15. Prior to going, he had to give an exhaustive list of the repair team's names, the colour of their cars and registration numbers to the Israelis, because 'a mistake could be deadly'.
As Rabih and his team laboured for two hours to fix the cable, the buzz of a drone above him and the sounds of shelling intermingled with the sound of their excavator.
'Any wrong move could mean being targeted. I cannot explain to my wife and kids why I do that or why I volunteer to go out during the war. My company doesn't oblige me, but if someone can do it, it has to be me,' he said.
Staff in the West Bank watch their colleagues in Gaza from afar with bated breath, hesitant to ask them to check on damaged equipment, knowing that a simple repair trip could cost them their lives.
Gaza-based staff are under no obligation to go into the field, but most have been eager to volunteer despite the dangers.
'It is very difficult to call my colleagues who are under bombardment and ask them to go out. I feel afraid that if one of them gets hurt, I will never forgive myself,' said Mohammed*, a worker in the Network Operation Centre in the West Bank.
Mohammed's role at the centre requires him to monitor problems in the network, ask workers to volunteer to repair them and stay on the phone with them to provide feedback on the repairs. The calls are nerve-racking, and both Mohammed and the worker in Gaza want the field visit to be resolved as quickly as possible.
'I cannot imagine how these people have the courage to go out. Maybe if I were there, I wouldn't do it. I don't know if I would,' Mohammed said.
At the mercy of Israel
No matter how many metres deep they dig or the number of solar panels they install, Gaza's connections to the outside world ultimately relies on the Israelis.

The cables that connect Gaza to the outside world run through Israel, and the country on at least two occasions has deliberately cut off the strip's international communications.
'It's clear for us that it was cut off by a decision. What proves this is that we didn't do anything to get it back,' Melhem said.
Israel also controls fuel to Gaza, allowing a small trickle into Gaza on Friday after weeks of pressure from the United States.
Described as a 'drop in the bucket' by humanitarian groups, Israel announced that 120,000 litres (31,700 gallons) of fuel would be allowed into the territory every two days for use by hospitals, bakeries and other essential services.
PalTel will also be given 20,000 litres (5,283 gallons) of fuel every two days for its generators.
On Thursday, the company had announced it would go into a full telecoms blackout because its fuel reserves were exhausted for the first time during the current war.
According to Mamoon Fares, the corporate support director at PalTel, the 20,000 litres provided 'should be enough to operate a good part of the network'.
However, Gaza's telecoms network will still be at the mercy of Israel should it decide to cut off fuel deliveries or network services that run through its territory.
Without the ability to communicate, the already dismal situation in Gaza would only further deteriorate.
'No ambulances, no emergency services, no civil defence or humanitarian organisations can work without telecommunications,' Melhem said.
* Names have been changed to protect the individuals' safety.

Katherine Maher replaces former Web Summit CEO following 'war crimes' post

Katherine Maher, the former boss of Wikipedia, has been appointed as CEO of the leading European technology conference Web Summit.
Her appointment comes after  , a co-founder of Web Summit, stepped down following a backlash over his accusations that Israel is committing 'war crimes' and breaching international law.
Web Summit said  in a statement Maher was selected by the board to lead the company through the transition period and added that she has "the ability to bridge the worlds of technology, humanity, and dialogue".
Maher, 40, led the Wikimedia Foundation, the global nonprofit behind Wikipedia, for five years and is also chair of messaging platform Signal Messenger.
'I am excited to join Web Summit, because I believe in Web Summit's mission to connect people and ideas that change the world," Maher said, according to the company's statement.
She will lead this year's Web Summit conference, scheduled from November 13 to 16 in Lisbon, Portugal.
The annual conference attracts many of the tech world's top names. But following Cosgrave's comments on the Israel-Gaza war, some companies withdrew their participation.
Never again
Cosgrave, an Irish entrepreneur who founded Web Summit in 2009, took to the social media platform X a few days after Hamas's unprecedented attacks on Israel, saying: 'I'm shocked at the rhetoric and actions of so many Western leaders & governments, with the exception in particular of Ireland's government, who for once are doing the right thing."
'War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are.'
David Marcus, the CEO of tech company Lightspark, lashed out at Cosgrave on X, saying he was "saddened" by Cosgrave's "ill-informed stance".
"You could've taken a more nuanced one, condemning these atrocities and calling for restraint. That would've been acceptable. You chose to support terrorists. As such I'll never attend/sponsor/speak at any of your events again," Marcus said.
Saddened by your ill-informed stance. You could've taken a more nuanced one, condemning these atrocities and calling for restraint. That would've been acceptable. You chose to support terrorists. As such I'll never attend/sponsor/speak at any of your events again.
- David Marcus (@davidmarcus) October 15, 2023
Multinational companies like Siemens, Intel, Meta and Google also said they will not attend this year's summit.

Cosgrave's resignation came as many students and professionals face blowback for their public views on the Israel-Hamas war.
Rights advocates say much of the corporate response has minimised the suffering in Gaza and created an atmosphere of fear for workers who want to express support for Palestinians.
But Maher is keen to ensure the focus "returns to what Web Summit does best: delivering dialogue among all those connected with technological advancement".
"In recent weeks Web Summit has been at the centre of the conversation, rather than the host. Its purpose was overshadowed by the personal comments of the event's founder and former CEO, Paddy Cosgrave," Maher said.
"Today Web Summit is entering its next phase," she added.

Pakistan, Turkey, Iran leaders visit Central Asia in diplomatic push

November 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Leaders of Russia, Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan are all making stops in Central Asia as global powers seek to expand their influence in the traditionally Russia-dominated region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin touched down in Kazakhstan's capital Astana on Thursday morning for talks with his counterpart Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.
The trip comes just a week after French President Emmanuel Macron also   there, hoping to "accelerate" economic cooperation.
Meanwhile, Turkey's leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi, and Pakistani Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar are visiting Uzbekistan on Thursday for a regional economic summit.
The flurry of engagement shows how the former Soviet countries are opening up to new partnerships as Russia's grip on the region wanes.

Putin and Tokayev nevertheless praised their countries' relationship before their planned meeting in Astana.
"Our strategic partnership is truly forward-looking," Putin said.
Tokayev hailed an "alliance with a rich past and a bright future'.
But more than 30 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, with Russia locked in a bloody, 20-month war with Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other Central Asian nations are eyeing partnerships with other world powers.
Jockeying for influence
China has become a key player throughout the region owing to its Belt and Road Initiative, a mammoth infrastructure development project that spans 150 countries.
The European Union, the United States, Iran and Turkey are also competing for sway in Central Asia.
Iran and Turkey are set to join Pakistan's prime minister and Central Asian leaders for a summit of the regional Economic Cooperation Organisation in Tashkent on Thursday.
While the summit comes as the monthlong war between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas  , the conflict in Gaza will not be on the agenda, Uzbekistan said.
On October 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
Aiming to destroy Hamas, Israel responded with a relentless bombardment and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 10,500 people, more than a third of them children, according to Gaza's health officials.
Tehran, which backs Hamas, said it did want to discuss the conflict, its state-run agency IRNA said.
However, Erdogan – who has been a vocal critic of Israel and recently recalled his ambassador from Israel – is likely to broach the topic.
Strengthening trade
Most of the talks at the summit are expected to focus on trade, humanitarian cooperation, and transport.
Central Asian countries, which are landlocked, are trying to gain access to the sea, including via Pakistan.
Russia is under pressure in the region but it remains a key partner.
Moscow renewed investments in the energy sectors, having been excluded from most of the European market by sanctions triggered by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
It has launched huge energy projects, including launching gas supplies to Uzbekistan via Kazakhstan.
It is also discussing building nuclear power plants and hydroelectric projects in several countries.

Telegram restricts access to Hamas channels on Google, Apple stores

Telegram, the encrypted messaging app, has quietly restricted access to several channels affiliated with the Palestinian armed group Hamas.
Hamas's official account, the account of its armed wing the Qassam Brigades, and the news account Gaza Now have not been accessible on versions of Telegram downloaded from Google Play or Apple's App Store since last week.
The accounts, which have amassed hundreds of thousands of new followers since Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel, are still accessible from the online version of Telegram and the version of the app downloaded directly from Telegram's website.
While Telegram has not publicly commented on the reasons for the move, the restrictions appeared after the Zachor Legal Institute, a US-based lobby group that campaigns against "anti-Israel movements", last week wrote a letter to Apple pointing out that seven Hamas-linked accounts remained accessible on iOS despite being blocked for Android users.
Apple and Telegram did not respond to requests for comment, but Google told Al Jazeera in a statement that Google Play requires apps that feature user-generated content to moderate 'egregious content, including content that promotes terrorist acts, incites violence, or celebrates terrorist attacks'.
Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan and Paraguay.
Telegram has been used heavily by Hamas to promote its message and it used the app to broadcast violent videos and images of its attacks on southern Israeli communities in real time. Other armed groups such as ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda have also used Telegram, which is known for its hands-off moderation, to promote their ideology and claim responsibility for attacks.
'Telegram served a purpose to Hamas that day and every day since because it lacks moderation policies and these lax rules allow militant groups to upload graphic footage of the carnage they are participating in, and then that content will filter to other places on the internet like X,' Layla Mashkoor, an associate editor at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, told Al Jazeera.
The official channels of the Qassam Brigades and Hamas added nearly half a million and 100,000 subscribers, respectively, after the October 7 attacks.
Gaza Now – which is described as "Hamas-aligned" by the Atlantic Council – went from 343,506 subscribers to nearly 1.9 million.
Since the introduction of the restrictions on the Google Play and App Store versions of Telegram, the channels have lost between 10,000 and 80,000 subscribers.
Mashkoor said Hamas's status as the government of Gaza sets it apart from armed groups like ISIL, even though both may share violent content through channels like Telegram.
'The facts are the facts and they are officially a representative group for Gaza and that does demand that conversations around how we treat state leaders or officials come into consideration, but then of course the other element that needs to be considered [is] the graphic nature and the violence and how you balance that - which is a really difficult thing to determine,' she said.
Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has defended the platform's loose moderation policies, arguing that it has provided valuable information about the Israel-Hamas war and is less likely to spread harmful content than competitors as users must opt in to channels.
'As such, it's unlikely that Telegram channels can be used to significantly amplify propaganda," Durov said in a post on Telegram earlier this month, adding that moderators remove millions of pieces of harmful content every day.
"Instead, they serve as a unique source of first-hand information for researchers, journalists and fact-checkers. While it would be easy for us to destroy this source of information, doing so risks exacerbating an already dire situation."

'A message': Why is Biden dispatching a US strike group during Gaza war?

October 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - As the war rages on  , the United States has moved one of the largest aircraft carriers in the world and an accompanying strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean, bringing its military might to the tense region.
US officials have framed the move as aimed at deterring Hezbollah and Iran from "taking advantage" of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.
But with that stance, analysts say President Joe Biden is effectively threatening to enter the war on Israel's side should a broader conflict break out. Still, many believe it is highly unlikely that the US military would directly take part in the hostilities.
"The administration judged it to be important to take a step that would make it as clear as possible to Hezbollah and Iran that there is the danger of US military intervention on behalf of Israel," said Steven Simon, a senior research analyst at the Quincy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.
"I'm pretty sure that President Biden does not want to get involved in this war. But sometimes you have to do these things to buttress deterrence," added Simon, who previously served in senior positions on the White House National Security Council and in the State Department.
  this week that his administration had enhanced its "force posture in the region to strengthen our deterrence" as a warning to any country or organisation considering an attack on Israel.
Days earlier, when the US announced it would send the USS Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group to the region, a defence official put Washington's position more bluntly.
"These posture increases were intended to serve as an unequivocal demonstration in deed and not only in words of US support for Israel's defence and serve as a deterrent signal to Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah and any other proxy across the region who might be considering exploiting the current situation to escalate conflict," the official said .
"Those adversaries should think twice."
USS Ford a 'political and strategic' signal
The status quo in the region was upended on Saturday when the Palestinian group Hamas launched a   against Israel from the besieged Gaza Strip, killing hundreds of people and taking dozens captive.
Israel has responded by placing Gaza under a total blockade, preventing fuel and water from entering the strip. It has also bombed the territory relentlessly, as the Israeli military appears to prepare for a ground invasion.
Paul Salem, president of the nonprofit Middle East Institute, said the scale and brutality of Hamas's attacks facilitated a "much clearer American response" in support of Israel than in previous  .
"Having the aircraft carrier there is major political and strategic signalling," Salem told Al Jazeera.
But he added that a US military intervention would be "far-fetched".
"Definitely they're signalling to Hezbollah and Iran: 'Do not get involved. If you do get involved, you might have to deal with us,'" Salem said.
"It's not clear what that would mean. And keeping in mind that Biden is entering an election year, it's not great for him to enter a war in the Middle East. So he has political constraints as well."
The arrival of these highly capable forces to the region is a strong signal of deterrence should any actor hostile to Israel consider trying to take advantage of this situation, said General Michael Erik Kurilla, commander, U.S. Central Command. https://t.co/URHNRuPdvn pic.twitter.com/fQhjW8UAVt
- U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) October 10, 2023
On Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated US commitment to Israel's security during a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
"You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself. But as long as America exists, you will never ever have to. We will always be there by your side," Blinken told Netanyahu.
Israel, which has been accused by major rights groups like Amnesty International of imposing a   on Palestinians, already receives $3.8bn in US aid annually.
The Quincy Institute's Simon explained that while Israeli forces are capable of fighting on several fronts, the potential for US attacks against Hezbollah would help Israel in a possible war.
He noted that the USS Ford carries 90 combat aircraft that could keep up "serious operational tempo", including intercepting communications.
"If the United States says to Israel, 'We'll pick up a little bit of a burden against Hezbollah, so you can continue to focus on Hamas,' then I think the Israelis would be very happy," Simon told Al Jazeera.
The Lebanese front
Experts say it likely will not come to that. Since the war broke out, there have been skirmishes between  , but they have stayed contained in the Lebanese-Israeli border area.
Salem, the president of the Middle East Institute, said Hezbollah is trying to draw some of Israel's military focus from Gaza to the Lebanese border without igniting a full-on conflict.
"They're playing that game of making it hot enough to get Israel's attention and to force them to pay attention to the northern front in order to weaken the forces in the south, but not so much that it immediately triggers a war in Lebanon, on Lebanon," he said.
Still, Salem added that the calculus of Hezbollah and its Iranian backers may change depending on the trajectory of the  .
"If there's a huge Israeli retaliation, yes, it's going to kill a lot of people. But if it doesn't defeat Hamas and if it [the conflict] ends in a few weeks, then Hezbollah wouldn't need to open a second front," he told Al Jazeera.
"But if Israel does 'really well' and is careening through Gaza and is about to completely knock out Hamas, I think there will be a lot of pressure strategically from Iran and others. They don't want to lose Hamas as an asset, so they might have to act."
For his part, Imad Harb, director of research at the nonprofit Arab Center Washington DC, said Lebanon's internal   crises also cap the chances of a war with Israel.
The country's economy has been in free fall since late 2019, with its currency losing more than 90 percent of its value. A   has also prevented the election of a new president since Michel Aoun's term expired nearly one year ago.
"Lebanon cannot take another war. Hezbollah's constituency cannot take a war, and neither are the Arab states ready to assist Lebanon if Lebanon gets in a war with Israel and in the process gets destroyed," Harb told Al Jazeera.
Hezbollah's response
Hezbollah has dismissed the arrival of the US military to waters not far  .
"Sending aircraft carriers to the region to boost the morale of the enemy [Israel] and its frustrated soldiers shows the weakness of the Zionist military machine despite the massacres and crimes it is committing and therefore its need for constant outside support," the Lebanese group said in a statement.
"Thus, we stress that this move will not scare the people of our nation and the resistance groups that are ready for confrontation until total victory."
Harb said Hezbollah's response is unsurprising, and it doesn't mean the group is rushing to war. "This is all rhetoric. I mean, these guys — the Israelis, Hezbollah, the Iranians, the Americans — all of them are rhetoricians," he said.
Harb added that the US is not eager to go to war either. While Biden wants to be seen as standing with Israel, Harb explained that Americans have grown weary  , and a battle with Hezbollah and Iran could quickly spiral out of control.
"This is why a message like this is only a message," Harb said of the US military move. "Maybe Biden is just simply trying to take a stand, but I really don't see the United States getting really involved in a war of this nature."

Jordan says it won't sign energy and water exchange deal with Israel

Jordan has said that it won't sign a deal to provide energy to Israel in exchange for water – an agreement that was planned to be ratified last month.
"We had a regional dialogue about regional projects. I think that all of this …, the war [has] proven, [it] will not proceed," Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told Al Jazeera on Thursday, referring to the  .
"We will not sign this agreement any longer. Can you imagine a Jordanian minister sitting next to an Israeli minister to sign a water and electricity agreement, all while Israel continues to   in Gaza?" asked the top diplomat of Jordan, which borders Israel to the east.
Jordan and Israel have held a fragile peace agreement since 1994, which returned some 380km (236 miles) of Jordan's occupied land from Israeli control and resolved long-standing water disputes.
"We [Jordan] signed the peace agreement in 1994 as part of a wider Arab effort to establish a two-state solution. That has not been achieved. Instead, Israel has not upheld its part of the agreement. So the peace deal will have to remain on the back burner gathering dust for now," he said.
All of Jordan's efforts were focused on ending what Safadi described as the "retaliatory barbarism carried out by Israel" in Gaza.
"Israel's aggression and crimes [in Gaza] can no longer be justified as  . It has been killing innocent civilians and  ," he told Al Jazeera.
"If any other state had committed a fraction of what Israel is doing now, we would have seen sanctions imposed on it from every corner of the globe," he added.
This month, Jordan announced it was 'immediately' recalling its ambassador to Israel in response to the war in Gaza, accusing Israel of creating an 'unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe'.
Safadi said Jordan would never enter into a dialogue about who runs Gaza after the war, considering such a move now could be seen as a green light to Israel to do whatever it wants.
"If the international community wants to talk about this, it must stop the war now," he added.
Jordan, like other Arab and Muslim countries, has strongly condemned Israel's bombardment of Gaza in which more than 11,600 people have been killed, including more than 4,700 children. Israel has also launched a ground offensive and restricted supplies of water, food and electricity to the enclave.
Safadi spoke as the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA),  , warned of a 'deliberate attempt to strangle' its operations in the Gaza Strip and said it risks shutting down all its humanitarian work because of a lack of fuel.
Israel  into the Gaza Strip as part of a 'complete siege' on the area after Hamas fighters from Gaza launched an attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.

The Gaza medics who won't give in to Israel's evacuation demand

Gaza City – Dr Nisreen al-Shorafa has gotten barely 10 hours of sleep over the past seven days.
The 30-year-old surgeon runs the emergency room at Al Awda Hospital in Tal al-Zaatar, between Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, and she cannot recall a time when she has worked harder.
Dedicated completely to helping save the people who survived the relentless Israeli bombing, she has pushed herself beyond what she thought she could do.
On Saturday, the hospital started receiving warning calls from the Israeli military. The message was stark and ominous: The hospital had to be evacuated because it would be bombed.
"I'll bet they [Israeli army] are proud of themselves, threatening to bomb the hospital," said resident nurse Asala al-Batsh.
"They insisted that everyone and everything move. All hospital personnel, all the patients, including those in the ICU, and the bodies in the morgue."
After trying to explain to the Israeli army on the phone the inhumanity and impossibility of moving everyone out of the hospital and southward, the team gave up.
"We decided not to leave," al-Shorafa said.

"The hospital's board of directors have no way to know if we're going to be bombed or not. But they're sure that we are doing the right thing.
"We are absolutely right to heed the call of duty; as doctors, as nurses, all of us need to unite at times like this."
Al Awda means 'The Return'
In addition to working around the clock to treat all the injured people who have come through the doors, the hospital has opened its doors to those fleeing the destruction and looking for what they hope is a safe place to shelter.
Many people are afraid to heed Israel's demand that they head south because convoys of evacuating people have been hit, and everyone in the hospital – doctors, patients, medics – is afraid that if they try to leave they will be killed on the road.
And so they huddle together, sleep deprived and running dangerously low on food and water.
The hospital says it has been receiving support from people living around it who are bringing in food and basic supplies for the patients and people seeking refuge.
'Working in a hospital, we hardly have time to eat on a normal day, so it is definitely not our priority right now," another nurse said, explaining that any assistance is used for the patients.
All of the hospitals in the Gaza Strip are stretched several times beyond capacity, to the point that patients are lying in the corridors and dead bodies have to be kept in refrigerated food or ice-cream trucks and lined up on the sidewalks before burial because the morgues are so full.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health has urged the international community to intervene several times, but no response or assistance has come.
"We're doing as much as we can, but there are major shortages, especially in the emergency room, which is our first line of response to people coming in. We're the line between life and death sometimes," al-Shorafa said.
"We work so hard," she said, her voice breaking. "We do absolutely everything we can, but then sometimes a patient will die … it feels like so many people die every single day since the beginning of this war.
"It's so hard, we feel utterly helpless," she said as a tear made its slow way down her exhausted cheek.

At least two killed in Israeli strike on southern Lebanon as tensions soar

November 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
At least two people have been killed in an Israeli attack in southern Lebanon, according to first responders and local media, amid growing concerns that the Israel-Hamas war could spread beyond Gaza.
Two people were killed in an Israeli strike on the town of Ainata on Monday, according to a first-responder organisation affiliated with the Hezbollah-allied Amal Movement and Lebanese state media.
It was not immediately clear if those killed were civilians.
The Israeli military said earlier that "terrorists fired towards several locations in northern Israel".
The army said its artillery struck the source of the fire and hit posts which "terrorists used to carry out launches toward Israel".
In a separate attack, Israeli forces shelled media teams and journalists in the Lebanese border village of Yaroun, official Lebanese news agency NNA reported.
Issam Mawasi, an Al Jazeera cameraman, was injured in the shelling, and the network's broadcast vehicle was damaged.
Separately, the Israel Electric Corporation said an employee died on Monday after being wounded in a missile attack carried out the previous day by the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah.
Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israeli forces from its stronghold in southern Lebanon after Israel launched an assault on Gaza last month in response to a Hamas attack on southern Israel.
Palestinian officials in Gaza say more than 11,200 people, including more than 4,600 children, have been killed since the Israeli assault began on October 7.
Around 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack on southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities.
The exchanges of fire along the Israel-Lebanon border mark the   fought a month-long war in 2006.
More than 70 Hezbollah fighters and 10 civilians have been killed in Lebanon, and 10 people including seven soldiers have been killed in Israel. Thousands more on both sides have fled shelling.
Until now, violence has largely been confined within a band of territory on either side of the border.
Israel has said it does not want war on its northern front as it seeks to topple Hamas in Gaza. The United States has said it doesn't want conflict to spread around the region, sending two aircraft carriers to the area to deter Iran from getting involved.
But that has not stopped the escalating rhetoric from Hezbollah and Israel.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said on Saturday that the Lebanon front would "remain active", and said there was "a quantitative improvement" in the pace of the group's operations.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Hezbollah on Monday not to broaden its attacks.
"This is playing with fire. Fire will be answered with much stronger fire. They should not try us, because we have only shown a little of our strength," he said in a statement.
Asked at a news conference on Saturday about what Israel's red line was, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: "If you hear that we have attacked Beirut, you will understand that Nasrallah has crossed that line."
'Tit-for-tat'
Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, in an interview with Al Jazeera on Sunday, said he was reassured by the "rationalism" of Hezbollah so far.
"We are preserving self-restraint, and it's up to Israel to stop its ongoing provocations in south Lebanon," he said.
Lebanon took years to rebuild from the 2006 war and can ill afford another one, four years into a financial crisis that has impoverished many Lebanese and paralysed the state.
Israel has long seen Hezbollah as the biggest threat along its borders. The 2006 war killed 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 157 Israelis, mostly soldiers.
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin characterised the violence as "tit-for-tat exchanges between Lebanese Hezbollah and Israeli forces in the north", predicting Israel would remain focused on the threat from Hezbollah "for the foreseeable future".
"And certainly no one wants to see another conflict break out in the north on Israel's border in earnest," he told reporters in Seoul.
Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said: "I can definitely see a wider escalation, but I am not sure about a full conflict that nobody wants.
"Nobody wants one on one hand, and I think the US is playing a strong role keeping things under control."

Outrage at Israel's US, European allies grows after Gaza hospital blast

Tunis, Tunisia - Outrage was already widespread across the Arab world over the Israeli assault on Gaza when the bombing of  , which killed  , tipped the anger over into new territory.
Protesters took to the streets to declare that enough was enough with the West and its dogged support of Israel that rendered it incapable of acknowledging the inhuman violence being meted out to Gaza around the clock and going back years.
In Beirut, Tunis and Cairo, crowds confronted tear gas and water cannon as they protested against what Tunisians called the 'allies of Zionists'. The US embassy in Cairo warned of 'anti-US sentiment' as demonstrators gathered.
As popular anger took hold, crowds in the streets voiced their rejection of Western foreign policy and its attempts to project its influence – or soft power.
Western soft power in the region comes in different forms, all intended to predispose people to the West through cultural centres, funding civil society, educational outreach, hosting events, and encouraging consumption of cultural products from the Western country.
As the loci of world power shift and countries like China, India and Russia compete for influence with the traditional European and US presences, soft power becomes as important as security cooperation and military power.
And as anger grows over the West's unflinching support of Israel as it bombards Gaza, activists across the region are rejecting it, pointing to Western hypocrisy in favouring Israeli lives over their own.

'Arab kids don't matter'
Many Tunisians see the current presence of the West in their country as an extension of the legacy of colonisation.
Tunisian activist Henda Chennaoui and many of her fellow activists see the Israel-Gaza war as a continuation of the Western legacy of colonisation, and she predicts that anti-Western attitudes will spread.
"We're angry. They kept telling us that the fight for freedom and democracy and all kinds of rights is a common fight," Chennaoui said. "Now, we see that Arab and Muslim communities and kids don't matter.
"It's time to say that the time of colonisation is over. We need to recognise it and talk about it.'
Israel has diplomatic relations both within the Arab world and outside it, but few are as strong as its bond with the US, which provides it with $3.3bn in military aid each year.
On October 18, US President Joe Biden   to show his support for the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Sitting across from Netanyahu during a public appearance in Tel Aviv, Biden told him: 'Based on what I've seen, it appears as though it [al-Ahli Hospital attack] was done by the other team, not you.'
Netanyahu thanked him for his 'unequivocal support'.

Gala Riani, the head of strategic intelligence at the security agency S-RM, said Biden's public show of support for Israel is just the latest in a series of policies that have made people more wary of Western soft power advances.
The wariness, she pointed out, began as far back as the invasion of Iraq 20 years ago and former US President Barack Obama's pivot away from the Middle East.
That does not mean its soft power is completely neutered. 'The US continues to have a certain element of cultural 'pull' for the region,' Riani said.
'But the picture is complicated by the tension between elements of US culture – which may remain potent – and its regional policies which many people in MENA take issue with. Soft power is … a complicated piece when viewed from [MENA].'
Is the West on its way out?
Within Tunisia, as within much of MENA, Western influence is receiving pushback. In Tunisia, the influential anticorruption NGO, I Watch announced that it would no longer accept US funding  in light of its support for Israel. Elsewhere in the North African country, a proposed law, limiting NGOs' freedom to act independently, is receiving new impetus as the perception takes hold across society that many of the country's local NGOs are in fact Trojan Horses for Western influence and double standards, an analyst said.
OneTunisian employed by a European NGO spoke of their frustration over the donor government's support for Israel.
The NGO's building in Tunis had been vandalised by protesters and the employee, who spoke to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, said: "I can understand the anger of the people that attack our building."
The agency, the employee said, allegedly dismissed all its staff in Ramallah following the initial outbreak of hostilities.
"But we're all individuals who work there and the actions of the [European country's] government have nothing to do with the opinion of most employees … it [did] affect my view on my employer. I think it's time for a public statement," they said.
At the same time, advertisements for the Russia Today news channel have surged since Hamas invaded Israel in early October, possibly because international competitors smell blood in traditionally European media waters.
"I think it's going to be very hard for the West to recover from this," Tunisian essayist and commentator Hatem Nafti said.
Henda Chennaoui [Simon Speakman Cordall/Al Jazeera]
"It's disappointing for those of us who care about things such as liberal democracy and human rights to see those causes undermined like this," Nafti continued, pointing out how Europe and the US's actions in Israel had made it almost impossible to argue against the region's autocrats and dictators' case that the West's true concern for democracy and rights ended with white people.
"It's across the board now, look at how the supporters of [Tunisia's President] Kais Saied are using Western support for Israel to undermine the NGOs they suspect the West may be subsidising. Even the tiny minority of those in parliament who might vote against that can't.
"It goes further," he continued. "Every family has at least one member living in Europe. They're feeding this back to them. They're relaying their own experience of Europe's double standard back to Tunisia and North Africa. That's going to carry consequences."
Joost Hiltermann, MENA programme director for the International Crisis Group, a think tank, told Al Jazeera in an email that European soft power is fading.
"Europe's influence in the Middle East, already limited, may well decline further as people see it casting aside the very values it professes to uphold and seeks to export,' he said, before the hospital bombing.
He pointed to some European politicians declaring support for Israel at the start of the war, with scant mention of the Palestinian struggle.
They include figures like European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who underscored Israel's 'right to defend itself' without comment on the Palestinian lives lost.
"Europe's decision to declare solidarity with its ally Israel but without urging it to exercise restraint in its military assault on Gaza consistent with its obligations under international humanitarian law may well come at a high price,' Hiltermann said.

Key US lawmaker calls to pause millions of dollars in aid to Egypt

September 29th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A top Democratic lawmaker in the United States has urged pausing hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Egypt over human rights concerns, amid growing calls to slash assistance.
Congressman Gregory Meeks, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, made the request on Friday, saying that Egypt failed to meet the   criteria set by lawmakers to receive the aid.
US lawmakers had placed human rights conditions on $320m of the $1.3bn that Cairo receives annually from Washington.
But the administration of President Joe Biden waived the conditions earlier this month on grounds that the assistance advances US national interests. It ultimately  .
"Today, I requested the State Department pause a portion of US military financing to Egypt that is conditioned on human rights criteria," Meeks said in a statement, referring to the remaining $235m.
"Congress needs more clarity from the State Department on how concerns about treatment of  , as well as the rule of law are being tackled in our bilateral relationship."
The call comes as key Democratic   faces corruption charges over allegations that he accepted bribes to deliver political favours, including advancing the Egyptian government's interests in Washington.
Menendez, who stepped down from his role as the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after the charges, has   and pleaded not guilty. But his indictment has led to renewed demands in Congress to reassess assistance to Egypt.
"It's a devastating series of allegations, and as a committee, we now have a responsibility to understand what Egypt was doing and what Egypt thought it was getting," Chris Murphy said earlier this week.
"There are serious implications for US policy towards Egypt if – as the indictment suggests – they were trying to use illicit means to curry favour on the committee."
Meek's statement on Friday did not address Menendez's charges, but the congressman pledged to push to "ensure human rights and national security are integral pillars".
Rights groups have accused the government of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, which came to power in a 2013 military coup, of jailing tens of thousands of dissidents and outlawing virtually all forms of political opposition. Cairo has denied holding political prisoners.
Egypt launched a so-called "National Human Rights Strategy" in 2021 to improve its record, but rights groups have dismissed the effort. Amnesty International, for instance, called it a "shiny cover-up" for "unrelenting" abuses.
Egypt is a top US ally in the Middle East and North Africa. While Biden administration officials have offered some verbal criticism of Egypt over human rights, they often praise Cairo's mediating efforts between Israel and Palestinian groups in Gaza.
As a candidate, Biden promised to prioritise   in his foreign policy and criticised his predecessor Donald Trump's close ties with el-Sisi.
"No more blank checks for Trump's 'favorite dictator'," he wrote in a social media post in 2020, referring to the Egyptian president.
