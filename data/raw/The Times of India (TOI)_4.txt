Man held over Gaza clash protest alleges cop assault

MUMBAI: A 28-year-old architect and activist with the organization People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), who was arrested on Friday for a protest against the Israel-Palestine conflict in Gaza in the wake of the Hamas attacks , has accused the Mankhurd police of torturing him in custody. The architect, Ruchit Laad (28), has alleged that three policemen beat him up "very ruthlessly" at the Mankhurd police station. The architect told a magistrate's court that he had sustained a serious head injury, while his arms and hands were swollen as a result of the alleged assault. 
The Mankhurd police refuted the allegation of assault, calling it "baseless".The architect's lawyer, Shahabuddin Shaikh, said the magistrate examined the man's injuries, refused to grant the police further custody and asked the police to preserve CCTV footage at the police station.The People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) condemned the arrest and alleged police assault on two of their activists.The architect and another activist, Suprit Ravish (27) were arrested by the Mankhurd police on Friday on charges of wrongful assembly and under other sections of the Indian Penal Code or IPC.The complainant's lawyer said, "Taking cognisance of our complaint, the magistrate's court directed the police to get a medical test done at a government hospital. Teh court has asked the police to file their reply on October 16 or Monday." The lawyer said that they would also file a complaint with the state human rights commission about the "illegal arrest and assault in lock-up".The police illegally detained the activists in connection with the protests, claimed a statement released by Mihir Desai of PUCL. "Right to protest is a fundamental right of citizens and in the Supreme Court's words, it is the 'safety valve of democracy'," said Desai.The police, however, claimed that the PUCL activists had been arrested for assembling in huge numbers without permission from the authorities.Senior inspector of Mankhurd police station Mahadev Koli said, "Any accused [person] makes such frivolous and baseless allegations against the police... It is nothing new. They have made the allegation in the court and let the court take cognisance of it."  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Air India has evacuated its crew members and two other employees from Tel Aviv. The airline had cancelled its October 7 Delhi-Tel Aviv flight following deadly terror attacks in Israel and consequently the return flight did not operate. However, there were 10 crew members already in Israel - pilots and cabin crew - to operate the return flight.On Sunday the airline flew out these 10 crew members along with the station and airport managers out of Israel. 
They are learnt to have boarded a flight to Addis Ababa Ababa on Ethiopian and will take a connecting flight from there to India. "For AI, the safety of its passengers and employees is paramount. Given the situation in Israel, October 7 flight was cancelled and our people in Israel have been flown out," said sources.Details of this evacuation have been sought from AI and are awaited.Meanwhile, AI has for now cancelled its Israel flights till October 14. "Our flights to and from Tel Aviv will remain suspended till October 14, 2023, for the safety of our passengers and crew. Air India will extend all possible support to passengers who have confirmed bookings on any flight during this period," an Air India spokesperson said.AI has five flights weekly nonstops to Tel Aviv and will take a call on them depending on the situation in the country.Israeli airline EL AL had earlier announced it will resume India flights this October after a three-year pandemic gap and the journey was to be shorter thanks to it overflying Saudi Arabia and Oman now. What used to be about eight-hour journey earlier with the Israeli airline taking much longer routes - Tel Aviv-Red Sea-Gulf of Aden-Arabian Ocean to Delhi and Mumbai and ditto on the way back - was to become a 5.5-hour flight to Mumbai and an hour more for Delhi. El Al's Delhi-Tel Aviv was to commence from from October 29, said a leading travel agent. Now whether this plan changes remains to be seen. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israel-Hamas war: Why wealthy Jewish families are rejecting Ivy League colleges for their children

In response to a rise in pro-Palestine rallies and perceived anti-Israel sentiment at Ivy League universities, a number of affluent Jewish families are choosing alternative educational institutions for their children. These families, who have previously made significant donations to schools like Harvard and Columbia, are now removing these institutions from their application lists, a New York Post report said.Christopher Rim, a college admissions consultant and founder of Command Education, has observed a shift in preferences among high-school seniors and their families. “They’re not paying a single dollar more to the schools,” Rim told The Post. 
“They don’t want to be associated with these schools.”This change is largely driven by concerns over campus anti-Semitism, as evidenced by incidents at Harvard, Cornell, and other Ivy League schools. Families are increasingly opting for private schools in more conservative regions, such as Washington University in St Louis, Emory University in Atlanta, Southern Methodist University near Dallas, and Vanderbilt University in Nashville.The trend gained momentum following viral incidents of anti-Semitism on campuses and a lack of adequate response from university administrations. For instance, a family that had been consulting with Rim for over three years dropped Columbia University, their dream school, from their list. Instead, they are now applying to Emory and Washington University.This shift in preference is also affecting students already enrolled in Ivy League schools. Rim mentioned a student he had previously assisted in getting into the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, who is now seeking a transfer to the University of Southern California following anti-Semitic incidents at UPenn.“Wharton was a dream school just a few months ago. He was thriving and happy. But now it’s just not worth it,” Rim told the Post. “He couldn’t stand being there. He didn’t feel comfortable.”The growing boycott of Ivy League schools due to these concerns has led to a surge in applications to the alternative institutions, potentially making them more competitive. Rim attributes this trend to a failure on the part of university administrations to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all students, particularly when it comes to addressing anti-Semitic behavior and ensuring student safety.

PRAYAGRAJ: There is a need to understand the nuances of growing air power, preserve peace and if necessary, fight and win wars, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari said here Sunday at a time of the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the Palestine-Israel face-off.Chaudhari was addressing the parade in Prayagraj's Bamrauli on the IAF 91st anniversary, one of whose highlights was the unveiling of its new ensign.The IAF chief pushed for faster adoption of technology. "We must strive to be leaders in technology and innovation and invest in cutting-edge research, development and acquisition. Innovation must become part of our DNA, en abling us to adapt to emerging threats and challenges with ease. 
The force structure we develop must be futureready," Chaudhari said.This was the first IAF parade commanded by a woman, Group Capt Shaliza Dhami. Chaudhari underscored its significance. "Our Air Force is recognised as a service that provides excellent opportunities to bond together as a community, with newer avenues for women empowerment," he said.This was also the first IAF parade where an all-women contingent, composed of the newly inducted Agniveer Vayu women, marched with their malecounterparts.In the context of readiness, the IAF chief flagged rapidly shifting realities. "There is a need to assess ourselves candidly and to address any inhibitions to change," Chaudhari said.From multi-domain operations to hybrid warfare, there was a need to recognise that modern warfare transcends traditional boundaries. "The world is changing at a rapid pace and we must meet all new challenges coming our way. The Indian Air Force is not just a military force, it is a symbol of our nation's collective strength and determination," said Chaudhari, quoting a shloka (verse) from the Bhagwat Gita.

Israel war: Telegram blocks Hamas’ channels on Android

WhatsApp rival Telegram has restricted access to channels associated with the Palestinian militant group Hamas. This action was taken in response to mounting pressure from critics amidst the ongoing conflict and to curtail the group's online influence. According to a report by CNBC, the platform has stopped Android users from accessing both Hamas's official channels -- hamas_com, and the channel of the al-Qassam Brigades (which is the military wing of Hamas). The report didn’t confirm if the messaging platform has done the same for iPhone users as well. 
The report claims that Telegram users on Android who have tried accessing the channels are seeing a message. It reads: "Unfortunately, this channel can’t be displayed on Telegram apps downloaded from the Google Play Store."However, some other channels that are associated with Hamas, such as "Gaza Now," are still accessible on Telegram. "Gaza Now" boasts more than 1.6 million subscribers. This development was reported earlier by the Russian state-owned media agency Tass.Here’s what the Telegram CEO has to say about this changePalestine-based group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel earlier this month. This move has escalated violence in the region. Social media platforms have come under immense pressure to curb the spread of misinformation and propaganda in the middle of the war. As per the report, previously, Telegram’s CEO, Pavel Durov has resisted calls to remove Hamas’ presence on the app. The company stated that the group has been an important source of information about the war.In a recent post, Durov also confirmed that the platform’s moderators and AI tools have removed millions of posts related to the war that are “obviously harmful” every day. He also noted that “tackling war-related coverage is seldom obvious” and Hamas “used Telegram to warn civilians in Ashkelon to leave the area ahead of their missile strikes.” He said: “Would shutting down their channel help save lives — or would it endanger more lives? While it would be easy for us to destroy this source of information, doing so risks exacerbating an already dire situation.” For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Posters of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas in US opens new front of contention

NEW DELHI: Posters of Israeli hostages, held by the Hamas after the October 7 attack, on the sidewalks and subways in the US have inflated the ongoing tension as people divide over the purpose of the flyers.The posters featuring "Kidnapped" in bright red block letters with photos of captives -- according to some it is an urgent reminder of the men, women and children held in the Gaza strip and for some, it is "wartime propaganda", as people have been tearing the posters in collage campuses and around the cities down. “You should be ashamed of yourselves,” a man said in a video posted on social media as he watched two young people at the University of Southern California shove wadded-up posters into the trash, according to The New York Times.The display of posters featuring hostages has become a unique form of activism to keep the issue in the public eye. However, the act of removing these posters has evolved into a distinct form of protest, serving as both a "release of tension" and a "provocation by individuals" deeply concerned about the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians before the October 7 attack and subsequent airstrikes.The act of tearing down these posters has resulted in some individuals facing backlash on social media. 
Notably, a dentist in Boston and an individual in South Florida have lost their jobs due to their involvement in removing the posters.Those who oppose the posters have labelled them as wartime propaganda, while those defending the right to display them have accused the act of tearing them down as being "antisemitic" and "lacking in basic humanity". These disputes have increasingly taken on a volatile tone, serving as a proxy battle for the larger and ongoing life-and-death conflict in the Middle East.For Nitzan Mintz, one of the artists responsible for creating the posters, the virality of the campaign was a surprise. However, witnessing people forcibly remove the posters has exposed what she believes to be clear instances of antisemitism.“By accident, this campaign did more than bring an awareness of the kidnapped people. It brought awareness of how hated we are as a community,” Mintz was quoted as saying by NYT.A woman in the Brooklyn borough, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to the NYT, said, "She had torn down kidnapped posters after a friend in a group chat for activists encouraged her". She said the posters, according to her friend, "amounted to anti-Islamic war propaganda". For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

He told me that the group was in the city of Nazareth, and they were staying in a hotel. He also said all of them are safe, but they are uncertain about their return to India," he said.The group's guide in Israel had taken them to a hotel, where their accommodation had been arranged. However, they have been strictly warned against going out or making phone calls."Fr Mathew told me not to worry about them as they are all safe. He also said the tour company had assured them that they would be brought back home at the earliest," Fr Martin said.These families hail from Manimala, Pulikkallu, Karikkattoor, Karimbanakkulam, Pazhayidom, Cheruvally, Kulathoor and Changanassery.Church seeks help desks: The Syro-Malabar Church has urged the state as well as Union governments to ensure protection of Indians in Israel. In a statement, it demanded setting up help desks in coordination with the Indian embassy in Israel, external affairs ministry and Kerala government. It also urged authorities to consider operating special flights for stranded Indians.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

New information has surfaced which suggests that Iran may have been involved in coordinating the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel and the collaboration may have started over a year ago, New York Post reported.Iran's involvement in plotting the attack with Hamas dates back to August.According to a report cited by the New York Post, leaders from Iran, the Lebanon-based terror organization Hezbollah, and Hamas worked together to train the Palestinian terrorists responsible for a significant raid on Israeli settlements near the Gaza Strip.This group of leaders possessed "advanced knowledge" of the attack, the report noted. The new details come from captured Hamas terrorists who, during interrogation, disclosed that they had undergone a year of training for this attack, the New York Times said, quoting Israeli defense officials .However, Israeli and US officials are yet to uncover direct evidence directly linking Iran to the attack that occurred on a Saturday.The New York Times quoted senior Hamas official Ali Barakeh as saying "The implementation was all Hamas, but we do not deny Iran's help and support," suggesting that Iran might not have played a central role in planning the attack.An Israeli intelligence official cautioned that while Iranian officials may have been aware of joint-training by Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, it does not necessarily mean that Tehran was aware of the specific attack they were training for, according to the report.

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar spoke to his Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen on Saturday and reiterated India’s condemnation of terrorism and its support for a two-state solution. He also underlined the importance India attaches to international humanitarian law, as Israel continues its punitive action against Hamas in Gaza.Amid the deteriorating security situation in Gaza and continued loss of civilian lives, India has also stepped up its engagements with stakeholders who are working to defuse the situation. 
PM Narendra Modi had on Friday spoken to his UK counterpart Rishi Sunak and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan about the Israel-Hamas conflict.A UK readout of the Modi-Sunak conversation said the leaders discussed the “deeply distressing situation” in the Middle East and condemned Hamas’s attacks on Israel. India has so far not named Hamas in its condemnation of the October 7 terror attacks on Israel.According to Sunak’s office, the leaders also reiterated that Hamas did not represent the Palestinian people and reflected on the need to de-escalate tensions in the wider region.After his talks with his Israeli counterpart, Jaishankar said he appreciated Cohen’s sharing of the Israeli assessment of the current situation. “Reiterated our firm commitment to countering terrorism, observance of international humanitarian law and for a two-state solution,” said Jaishankar.Cohen thanked him for his support of Israel and of its war against the Hamasterrorist organization.“Our war is the entire democratic world’s war against a despicable terrorist organization that is worst than ISIS,” said Cohen on social media platform X.

Infosys announces variable payout for these employees; 80% payout for September quarter expected

Infosys, the Bengaluru-based IT giant, is set to distribute the quarterly performance bonus for the July-September period to eligible employees this month. The average payout is expected to be 80%, although individual payouts will vary based on performance and contribution for the quarter. Staff classified under position level 6 (PL6-manager) and below, that is those below the manager category but barring entry level positions, are slated to obtain the variable pay.This information was shared in an official communication by the engineering team HR head at Infosys, and the internal communication has been seen by ET. 
“This is to keep you all informed that the quarterly performance bonus payout for Q2FY2024 will happen in November 2023 payroll for all eligible employees,” the email reprtedly said.Unit delivery managers will finalize the distribution of the payout for their respective units and inform eligible employees this week. ET reached out to Infosys for comment but did not receive a response as of press time on Thursday.Infosys had frozen salary hikes in FY23 to conserve cash but started its annual appraisal cycle in October, as reported earlier. The payout of the performance bonus comes at a time when Infosys and other top-tier IT companies have reported muted revenue growth in the September quarter. Despite the challenging environment, Infosys managed to stay relevant and build a solid foundation for future market share expansions in Q2, according to an email announcing the payout.The 80% payout is consistent with the first quarter, but higher than previous quarters in FY22, where payouts ranged from 60% to 70%. In the quarter ended March this year, Infosys paid out 60% as variable pay.The annual appraisal cycle at Infosys begins in October and ends in September of the following financial year. The company usually discloses employee ratings by January and releases the letter of pay raise to employees in June. However, the IT industry as a whole has witnessed a decline in headcount in recent months due to industry-wide growth constraints.Infosys reported a marginal rise of 3.2% year-on-year in net profit for the quarter ended September, amounting to Rs 6,212 crore, with a 7% revenue growth at Rs 38,994 crore. Nevertheless, the company has revised its revenue growth guidance for FY24 to 1%-2.5% from the earlier estimates of 1%-3.5%. This is due to a reduction in tech spending by global clients, which has prompted IT firms to conserve cash and adopt a cautious approach to employee expenses, including fresh hiring.The $245-billion IT industry has faced pressure due to global macroeconomic concerns and ongoing geopolitical issues, such as the Israel-Palestine conflict, resulting in a decrease in technology spending.

A screening organized by Israeli actress Gal Gadot, featuring graphic footage of the Hamas attack on Israel, led to violent clashes outside the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles on Wednesday night, reported ABC 7.Police presence was heightened in anticipation of potential disruptions during the showing of the 43-minute film, "Bearing Witness to the October 7th Massacre," which depicted the atrocities committed by Hamas, including footage shot by the terrorists.Controversy and threats on social media preceded the screening, with pro-Palestinian supporters accusing Gadot of supporting genocide, while pro-Israel advocates defended her.As the event unfolded, dozens gathered outside the museum, resulting in multiple fights and the use of pepper spray by law enforcement. A skirmish line was formed by the police to control the crowd, leading to several detentions, though it remains unclear if arrests were made.Approximately 200 people, including Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, an official from the Israel Defense Forces, and Hollywood executives, attended the screening under heavy security.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass condemned the violence, stating, "We cannot allow current worldwide tension to devolve into this unacceptable violence in our city. 
This is a time of immense pain and distress for thousands of Angelenos. We must stand together."Gal Gadot, who did not attend the screening in person, has not made any public statements about the incident. The actress, known for her role in "Wonder Woman," previously served in the IDF and has been vocal in her support of Israel. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: As the battle between Israel and Hamas enters its fourth week, colleges in the US have been witnessing an increase in hate crimes that appear to target Jewish and Muslim individuals, reported USA Today. Several colleges across the nation, spanning from the San Francisco Bay Area to Upstate New York, have reported incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia. These incidents have prompted politicians and civil rights organisations to voice their concerns, highlighting the growing sense of vulnerability among students on campus.“Let me be clear: we cannot allow hate and intimidation to become normalized,” New York Governor Kathy Hochul, according to the news outlet, said in a statement Tuesday after a "Cornell University student was accused of making antisemitic threats at the Ithaca, New York, campus". “As Governor, I reaffirm that there is zero tolerance in New York for antisemitism, Islamophobia, or hate of any kind, and it’s critical we deploy every possible state resource to keep New Yorkers safe,” she added.Nonprofit and activist organizations representing Jewish and Muslim students have condemned the recent spurt in attacks, harassment, and intimidation directed at students since the outbreak of the conflict. 
The Council on American-Islamic Relations' Maryland office, in a statement issued on October 11, expressed deep concern about the rising incidents of harassment and intimidation directed towards Muslim and Arab students, driven by the ongoing overseas crisis.According to USA Today, the organisation "pleaded with college and high school administrators to devote attention and take action to protect these students and investigate all reports of targeted attacks or threats". Furthermore, the Anti-Defamation League, a renowned civil rights organization dedicated to combating acts of hate and antisemitism, joined forces with the Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law in a statement issued on October 25. Their joint statement urged universities to launch a probe into their local chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine. The purpose of these investigations is to determine if there is any potential support for a terrorist organization, highlighting the need for vigilance in the face of the ongoing conflict's repercussions within academic institutions.

Israel-Hamas war: 'Rise in anti-Muslim racism in France'

In France, there has been a notable increase in anti-Muslim racism, which has been largely unchecked since the Hamas attack on October 7. This surge in racism has been particularly evident in the aftermath of a Moldovan couple being caught spray-painting stars of David in Paris's 10th arrondissement on October 27. Despite the couple's arrest and the prosecutor's statement linking these and other similar antisemitic acts to a foreign sponsor, Muslims in France continue to face scapegoating, especially from far-right groups, a Middle East Eye report said.The ministry of the interior in France reported a threefold increase in antisemitic acts and statements since the Hamas attack, totaling 1,518 incidents. Jordan Bardella, president of the National Rally, without providing evidence, attributed this rise in antisemitism to the alleged growth of "political Islam" in various neighborhoods.Amidst the escalating tensions in France during the deadly phase of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with significant casualties on both sides, the Muslim community is concerned about the misuse of violence in the Middle East to fuel hatred against them. Abdallah Zekri, a leader in the French Council of Muslim Worship (CFCM) and president of the Observatory against Islamophobia (OCI), criticized the exploitation of Middle Eastern violence to incite hatred against Muslims.The CFCM refused to participate in an anti-antisemitism march, criticizing it for not addressing the rise in Islamophobic acts in France. 
Zekri highlighted the direct threats faced by many mosques and Muslims, including hate speech on news channels and social media.Notable figures like Pascal Perri and Arno Klarsfeld have made controversial statements linking antisemitism to the Muslim population, with Klarsfeld's comments currently under complaint for inciting racial hatred. The Grand Mosque of Paris's rector, Chems-Eddine Hafiz, expressed concern over the increasing stigmatizing and hateful discourse against Muslims in France, the Middle East Eye report said.Islamophobic acts have also been reported, such as attacks on a Franco-Turkish cultural association and a septuagenarian heading to a mosque. Sabrina Sebaihi, a member of parliament, highlighted the growing Islamophobia and the silence of political leaders on this issue.Interior minister Grald Darmanin has opened investigations into these incidents and reassured French Muslims of state protection, although he noted that the scale of anti-Muslim acts is not as extensive as antisemitism. Vincent Geisser, a researcher, pointed out that linking antisemitism with Islam contributes to the stigmatization of Muslims and serves far-right agendas. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: In a tragic and heart wrenching incident at the Tribe of Nova trance music festival near the Gaza Strip border, a 27-year-old Israeli woman, Mapal Adam, was killed "execution style" by Hamas gunmen.

Ma'ayan revealed that Mapal and Roey had recently moved in together and were deeply in love. Witnesses recounted the horrifying assault, where Hamas gunmen stormed the concert area, firing into the crowd and taking hostages.Mapal also has a record of serving in the Israeli military. In a heartfelt Instagram post, she expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to serve her country, saying: "One army, 72 years, 23,816 martyrs. Thank you for granting me the honor of serving my nation."The music's rhythm melded with the sound of gunfire as militants approached the festival, where hundreds of young partygoers were gathered. Videos circulating online captured the horrifying scenes of revelers being showered with bullets as they desperately tried to flee for their lives.Israeli emergency services recovered at least 260 bodies from the site, and the surprise Hamas assault resulted in the deaths of more than 800 soldiers and civilians. In response, Israeli military operations were launched in Gaza, leading to casualties among Palestinians in the area. The tragic incident left families shattered and communities in mourning.

Hubballi: Youth Brigade founder Chakravarti Sulibele took out a bike rally in the city as part of the statewide 'Janaganamana Beseyona' programme on Wednesday.
The programme is being organised to spread awareness among the public about the achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last nine years. The bike rally started from Moorasavia Mutt and passed through many streets in the city.
Speaking to reporters, Sulibele said that the bike rally has covered many districts in the state. The aim is to spread awareness among the people about the achievements of Narendra Modi-led government in the last nine years and he become the PM for the third time, he added. Replying to a question on Israel- Palestine conflict, he said that the Hamas terrorists have done very appalling acts. Small children are being held, this is an inhumane act, it is a big tragedy that the Indian coalition, including the Congress has extended support to the Hamas. The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) coalition aims to break the country. So the next six months are critical for Hindus, he said.
Police and innocent people were brutalised in DJ Halli-KJ Halli and Old Hubballi riots. Congress leaders' houses was attacked in the DJ Halli-KJ Halli riot. Now, the Congress government is trying to get rid of them. The government is taking wrong steps in both the incidents, he lashed out.

NEW DELHI: Lee Sasi, a reveler at an all-night music festival in Israel, shared her ordeal of hiding for seven agonizing hours under the bodies of those killed during a surprise attack by Hamas terrorists. The incident unfolded during the early hours of Saturday morning, as per New York Post report.The rave, which had drawn around 3,000 attendees, mostly young Israelis, was abruptly interrupted when Hamas militants infiltrated the event and unleashed a barrage of gunfire, sending the partygoers fleeing for their lives. Terrified attendees sought refuge in nearby orchards as the sound of gunfire echoed through the night.Sasi, along with approximately 35 others, sought shelter in a bomb shelter as the chaos raged around them. 
However, their sanctuary was short-lived when Hamas fighters discovered their hiding place, unleashing a barrage of random gunfire into the bunker.In a series of messages sent to a friend and subsequently shared with i24news journalist Natasha Raquel Kirtchuk Gutman on Instagram, Sasi described the horrors she and the others endured. According to her messages, there were initially between 30 and 35 people in the bomb shelter. However, when they were rescued seven hours later, only 10 had survived by hiding beneath the lifeless bodies of fellow festival-goers.In response to her friend's question regarding the number of survivors, Sasi confirmed, "Yes after 7 hours being in hiding under dead bodies in the bomb shelters.""I'm not joking," she added, attaching a photo that appeared to show several bodies stacked on top of each other.Sasi further recounted that during their ordeal, approximately 1,000 bullets were fired into the bomb shelter, and the attackers also threw 15 grenades into the enclosed space. This horrifying assault continued relentlessly for seven excruciating hours.In a testament to their resilience and with the help of relatives in Israel, Sasi and the surviving group members were eventually rescued. "We were so lucky. It was all by a miracle," she noted in one of her messages.The attack on the music festival has left a grim toll on both sides, with an estimated 800 Israelis killed, over 2,000 wounded, and more than 150 taken captive by Hamas reportedly, including foreign nationals. Meanwhile, Gaza health officials report at least 300 Palestinians killed and 2,200 injured since the tragic events of Saturday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared, "We are at war," vowing that Hamas would face a "price it has never known" for the heinous attack.

'Appalled, horrified': Hundreds of Columbia University professors sign letter over antisemitic incidents

Over 300 faculty members from Columbia University have voiced their concerns regarding a series of antisemitic incidents that have taken place on the Manhattan campus. This comes in the wake of a letter signed by numerous colleagues that defended students who expressed support for Hamas' October 7th terror attack.Jewish students had previously rallied on campus, criticizing the university administration for their perceived inaction in addressing the hostile environment that has emerged since the attack. This environment has been characterized by an attack on an Israeli student, death threats, and widespread hate speech and vandalism.While the faculty members acknowledge the importance of having a comprehensive debate on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, they firmly believe that there's no justification for the attack on Israeli civilians by Hamas. 
They expressed their shock at the celebration of these attacks and the attempt by some Columbia faculty members to frame them as a form of resistance or military action."We are horrified that anyone would celebrate these monstrous attacks or, as some members of the Columbia faculty have done in a recent letter, try to “recontextualize” them as a “salvo,” as the "exercise of a right to resist" occupation, or as military action," the letter said."We are astonished that anyone at Columbia would try to legitimize an organization that shares none of the University’s core values of democracy, human rights, or the rule of law," the letter added.The letter, which has been signed by renowned professors and academics from around the globe, emphasizes the university's responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of all its students. It calls out the antisemitic incidents that have occurred since October 7th, including verbal abuse, physical assaults, and the appearance of swastikas."Just as we condemn any bigoted comments or acts directed at Palestinian and Muslim students, we are appalled by the spate of antisemitic incidents on campus since October 7. These incidents, which include antisemitic epithets, physical assault, and swastikas scrawled on bathroom walls, are growing in frequency and are creating a hostile and unsafe environment that impacts our entire community, the letter from faculty members said.The faculty members urged the university to protect Jewish and Israeli students in the same way it would defend other groups from such reprehensible behavior.In response, a university spokesperson said that any form of hate, including antisemitism, will not be tolerated. They emphasized their commitment to ensuring the safety of Jewish students and protecting them from discrimination or harassment. However, specifics regarding the measures being taken by the university remain unclear. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: An octogenarian Israeli woman, whose video of being abducted on a golf cart by Hamas militants went viral on social media, was freed under the swap agreement between Israel and Hamas.Her family members released on Friday a picture of their reunion on a social media platform.“Grandma is here, healthy and beautiful. Thank you people of Israel,” wrote Adriana Adar, granddaughter of 85-year-old Yaffa Adar.“Thank you to everyone who supported us. It’s the first drop in the sea, we are waiting for you Tamir Adar, waiting for everyone!
 All of them! Right now, right now!!” Adriana said.Adriana was referring to her brother and Yaffa's grandson Tamir, who are still in Hamas captivity in Gaza.'Mom's back'The family of Margalit Moses, who too was freed Friday, posted a happy picture of the 78-year-old being surrounded by her loved ones."Mom's back!" her son Yair Moses captioned the photo.On October 7, both Yaffa and Margalit were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel. The incident unfolded as Hamas gunmen carried out a surprise attack on Israel, unleashing a combination of land, sea, and air assaults.The assault took place during Simchat Torah, a religious holiday, and the weekly Shabbat, catching Israel off guard. The attack resulted in the tragic death of 1200 civilians, with almost 240 others seized and transported to Gaza using various means such as motorbikes, trucks, vans, or golf carts.Considered as the most lethal assault since the Holocaust, Israel has declared its determination to seek retaliation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has personally assured the affected families that his government is committed to relentless efforts until all 240 individuals are safely returned home.Four-days truceThe release of hostages held in Gaza as part of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas brought a sigh of relief to their families. The reunions and even the mere news of their return brought tears, and disbelief to relatives and friends, many of whom had lost hope.Hamas since Friday, in exchange for 78 Palestinian prisoners, has released hostages in two batches held captive in embattled Gaza after a tense truce brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, halting a seven-week war that has seen incessant bombardment of the enclave.

NEW DELHI: A doxxing truck has been driving around the campus of Harvard University with the names and pictures of the students who allegedly wrote an open letter squarely blaming Israel for the recent escalation in the region. This comes a day after billionaire Bill Ackman sought the names of these students to be made public so that CEOs of American companies do not hire them.According to a report in The New York Post, the truck has giant video screens hung on the sides and back with the words "Harvard's Leading Antisemites" being displayed in gothic script.It also features a slideshow of the pictures of the students with their names written in bold, red block letters, according to photos being circulated on social media.The ivy league university has been at the centre of a major backlash after the open letter, written by Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups, said it held "the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence."A number of Harvard University students and organizations are scrambling to reverse their support for the letter. Some business leaders are also contemplating blacklisting these individuals from future job opportunities.According to the report, the truck's surprise appearance around the campus "was the first day [of a] multi-day, multi-pronged campaign involving multiple billboards and a variety of other tactics," accuracy in Media president Adam Guillette said.He said that the truck was deployed to make people aware about the "hateful antisemites" in our society. 
Meanwhile, four of the original 34 student organizations associated with the contentious statement have already withdrawn their support amid the backlash. Additionally, board members of other groups have resigned to disassociate themselves from the letter. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Ron DeSantis, the Republican presidential candidate and Florida Governor, stated that he would revoke the student visas of foreign nationals in the United States and repatriate them to their home countries if they openly expressed support for terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel, according to a Fox news report.During a campaign event in Iowa last Friday, the presidential candidate discussed his intentions to address concerns related to foreign nationals in the US who may have affiliations with Hamas. This comes as numerous pro-Palestinian student groups at various American institutions have issued statements and organized demonstrations in response to recent events, particularly the significant escalation of conflict justifying and even endorsing Hamas.DeSantis said, "You see students demonstrating in our country in favor of Hamas," DeSantis said. "Remember, some of them are foreigners." 
He further added that he will be "canceling your visa, and I'm sending you home" if he wins the presidency in 2024.Governor DeSantis has strongly condemned the attack by Hamas on Israel and has taken action to assist Floridians who were stranded in Israel to return home.In a recent announcement, the governor revealed that nearly 300 Floridians have safely returned to the Sunshine State on flights from Israel. This action was made possible through his executive order, which authorized logistical, rescue, and evacuation operations via Florida's Division of Emergency Management. These flights were carried out in collaboration with Project DYNAMO, a non-profit search and rescue organization, and there are plans for additional evacuation flights to Florida in the near future.Furthermore, the Florida Division of Emergency Management dispatched cargo planes to Israel, which contained essential supplies such as medical equipment, clothing items, hygiene products, and children's toys. Earlier, DeSantis had called the students supporting Hamas, a "total disgrace". This came in response to multiple student groups from various US academic institutions, including Harvard University, endorsing Hamas' actions against Israel through public statements and protests. However, many of these universities themselves condemned acts of terrorism.DeSantis has also said he does not support accepting refugees from Gaza who wish to evacuate the violence in the region.DeSantis has also spoken against US accepting Gaza refugees. He said at an event earlier, "I don't know what [President] Biden's gonna do, but we cannot accept people from Gaza into this country as refugees. If you look at how they behave, not all of them are Hamas, but they are all antisemitic. None of them believe in Israel's right to exist." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

West Asia conflict weighs on markets, sensex falls 483 pts

Mumbai: The Israel-Hamas conflict in West Asia impacted sentiment on Dalal Street on Monday with the sensex ending 483 points lower at 65,512, near the benchmark's five-week closing low mark. Financials and RIL led the slide while IT, FMCG and pharma partially cushioned the fall.
Most global markets remained steady but with a negative bias as investors preferred a wait-and-watch policy. Markets, from Nikkei in Japan to FTSE in the UK to the Dow Jones in the US, either ended marginally lower or were trading near the previous closing marks.
The escalation of the conflict in West Asia has rekindled pessimism in global markets, said Geojit Financial Services's Vinod Nair. In addition, "the rapid surge in oil prices presents a significant threat to the global market, which is already dealing with elevated inflation and interest rates". Although analysts are positive about quarterly earnings numbers by leading companies, "geopolitical tensions could potentially disrupt this optimistic outlook", Nair said.
The impact of the conflict on crude oil prices is expected to be temporary since "neither Israel nor Palestine is a major oil supplier and, so far, the conflict has not directly threatened any major oil production or supply facilities," Rahul Kalantri of Mehta Equities said in a note. However, market players fear that if the hostilities continue and major oil producing nations in the region take sides, that, along with the recent production cut moves announced by OPEC+ block, could push up crude oil prices. The day's selling in the stock market left investors poorer by nearly Rs 4 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 319.4 lakh crore.
In the near term, expect the markets to remain volatile amid geopolitical stress and inflationary pressure ahead of inflation data from the US, Europe and China later during the week, said Siddhartha Khemka, head, retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
In the forex market, the rupee closed nearly unchanged at 83.27 to the dollar, compared to 83.25 on Friday. However, forex traders were cautious about the geopolitical tensions and the hardening of US treasury bill yields. In the domestic government bond market, however, bearish trend persisted with yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt firming up to 7.38% from 7.34% on Friday.

Expert warns Iran's entry into Israel-Hamas war could compel Russia and China to intervene

Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, concerns are growing over the potential for the involvement of major world powers, namely the United States, Russia, and China. Professor Justin Bronk, a prominent military expert from London's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), has issued a stark warning regarding the situation, reported Mail Online.Professor Bronk has emphasized that if Iran were to launch an attack on Israel in retaliation for its incursion into Gaza, this could trigger a chain of events that might compel Russia and China to intervene. He pointed out that Iran, along with its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon, could provide a secondary front in the conflict. 
The United States has already issued warnings to Hezbollah and Iran, urging them to refrain from entering the war.Until now, Russia and China have shown restraint in their public statements regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict. However, should Iran become directly involved, Russia may feel obligated to support it, given the strategic relationship between the two nations.The situation in the region has become increasingly complex.

West Asia conflict weighs on markets, sensex falls 483 pts

MUMBAI: The Israel-Hamas conflict in West Asia impacted sentiment on Dalal Street on Monday with the sensex ending 483 points lower at 65,512, near the benchmark's five-week closing low mark. Financials and RIL led the slide while IT, FMCG and pharma partially cushioned the fall.Most global markets remained steady but with a negative bias as investors preferred a wait-and-watch policy. Markets, from Nikkei in Japan to FTSE in the UK to the Dow Jones in the US, either ended marginally lower or were trading near the previous closing marks.The escalation of the conflict in West Asia has rekindled pessimism in global markets, said Geojit Financial Services's Vinod Nair. 
In addition, "the rapid surge in oil prices presents a significant threat to the global market, which is already dealing with elevated inflation and interest rates". Although analysts are positive about quarterly earnings numbers by leading companies, "geopolitical tensions could potentially disrupt this optimistic outlook", Nair said.The impact of the conflict on crude oil prices is expected to be temporary since "neither Israel nor Palestine is a major oil supplier and, so far, the conflict has not directly threatened any major oil production or supply facilities," Rahul Kalantri of Mehta Equities said in a note. However, market players fear that if the hostilities continue and major oil producing nations in the region take sides, that, along with the recent production cut moves announced by OPEC+ block, could push up crude oil prices. The day's selling in the stock market left investors poorer by nearly Rs 4 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 319.4 lakh crore.In the near term, expect the markets to remain volatile amid geopolitical stress and inflationary pressure ahead of inflation data from the US, Europe and China later during the week, said Siddhartha Khemka, head, retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.In the forex market, the rupee closed nearly unchanged at 83.27 to the dollar, compared to 83.25 on Friday. However, forex traders were cautious about the geopolitical tensions and the hardening of US treasury bill yields. In the domestic government bond market, however, bearish trend persisted with yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt firming up to 7.38% from 7.34% on Friday. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

50 years of Yom Kippur war: How US aided Israel's military victory

The Yom Kippur War, also known as the October War or the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, was a conflict that took place in October 1973, when Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israel during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur.The United States played a significant role in supporting Israel. The conflict underscored the U.S. Cold War perspective in the Middle East, as President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger viewed it primarily through a Cold War lens. An airlift of U.S. weapons aided Israel, helping them ultimately win, and Kissinger facilitated disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt, sidelining the Soviets. 
Here's a brief about the role played by US is supporting Israel:Military Resupply: The United States airlifted military supplies to Israel during the conflict. This support included ammunition, tanks, aircraft, and other vital equipment, which helped Israel replenish its dwindling resources on the battlefield.Diplomatic Support: The U.S. provided diplomatic support to Israel in international forums, including the United Nations, and worked to ensure that Israel's interests were defended.Financial Assistance: The U.S. granted financial aid to Israel to help cover the costs of the war and its aftermath. This aid was essential in helping Israel recover economically and rebuild its military.Intelligence Sharing: The U.S. shared intelligence information with Israel, helping them to anticipate enemy movements and make informed decisions on the battlefield.Strategic Cooperation: The U.S. and Israel had developed a strong strategic relationship over the years, which also played a role in supporting Israel during the war. Israel had received military hardware and training from the U.S. in the years leading up to the conflict.The U.S.'s longstanding support for Israel, while portraying it as a beleaguered state, has shaped its Middle East policy, but Israel has also built ties with China and Russia. The aftermath of the Yom Kippur War set a pattern of Israel prioritizing its interests in peace agreements, while the Palestinian issue remained unresolved, perpetuating tensions in the region.While U.S. support was significant in Yom Kippur war, it's essential to acknowledge that Israel's own military capabilities, quick mobilization of reserves, and the determination of its soldiers were key factors in its victory in the Yom Kippur War. Additionally, there were diplomatic efforts, including a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations, that contributed to ending the conflict. The Yom Kippur War was a complex and multifaceted conflict with many factors at play, and attributing Israel's success solely to U.S. assistance would oversimplify the situation.

NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden again came under fire and this time for hosting the barbecue at the White House Sunday afternoon while Israel was struggling with terrorists. The US President held the BBQ after the Israeli government officially announced the war, which sparked criticism from the lawmakers across US. "While Hamas holds Americans hostage, Joe Biden is enjoying a picnic with a live band," Republican Missouri Senator Josh Hawley tweeted, accompanied by a screenshot of a White House Pool report. 
The pool report, emailed just after 6 pm Sunday evening, notes that a reporter could hear a "live band" in the White House, The New York Post reported."In the late afternoon and early evening, a live band could be heard coming from the area near the Rose Garden. Your pooler asked why a band was playing. From the White House: The President and First Lady are hosting a BBQ for White House Executive Residence Staff and their families," the pool reporter wrote. Over 1000 people in Israel have died since the attacks began on Saturday morning.Hamas has reportedly taken a large number of hostages amid the attacks, including women and children, while US officials have also announced that 9 American citizens have been killed and some are still missing.According to AP, the State Department said on Monday that 9 Americans were killed. Official word of Americans killed in the conflict came as Israel retaliated for the incursion, one of the bloodiest in its history, launching attacks on the Palestinian enclave of Gaza.Earlier an official said that the number was fluid and had ranged from between six to 12. It is not clear whether the missing had been taken hostage, were killed, or are in hiding.The State Department is in touch with families "and providing all appropriate consular assistance," said spokesman Matthew Miller.

Expert warns Iran's entry into Israel-Hamas war could compel Russia and China to intervene

Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, concerns are growing over the potential for the involvement of major world powers, namely the United States, Russia, and China. Professor Justin Bronk, a prominent military expert from London's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), has issued a stark warning regarding the situation, reported Mail Online.Professor Bronk has emphasized that if Iran were to launch an attack on Israel in retaliation for its incursion into Gaza, this could trigger a chain of events that might compel Russia and China to intervene. He pointed out that Iran, along with its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon, could provide a secondary front in the conflict. 
The United States has already issued warnings to Hezbollah and Iran, urging them to refrain from entering the war.Until now, Russia and China have shown restraint in their public statements regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict. However, should Iran become directly involved, Russia may feel obligated to support it, given the strategic relationship between the two nations.The situation in the region has become increasingly complex. Israel has launched airstrikes in southern Gaza, urging Palestinians to evacuate ahead of an anticipated ground invasion. These airstrikes have tragically resulted in the loss of dozens of lives.Additionally, violence along Israel's border with Lebanon has sparked concerns of a broader regional conflict. Diplomatic efforts have been underway to prevent further escalation, but the situation remains highly volatile.Notably, historian Niall Ferguson has drawn attention to the current events, drawing parallels with the turbulent period of the 1930s and raising the question of whether this crisis could potentially lead to a more extensive global conflict.As the Israel-Hamas conflict continues to evolve, the international community remains on edge, with the risk of a wider conflict involving major world powers looming on the horizon.

'Kidnapped from Israel' gains momentum as compassion and controversy intersects

NEW DELHI: Two Israeli artists visiting New York have taken the initiative to raise awareness for the more than 200 hostages taken by Hamas. Nitzan Mintz, 32, and the artist known as Dede Bandaid, 36, employed their street art expertise in a unique way after they received news of the recent Hamas attacks on Israel.According to USA Today, too far from the conflict to provide direct assistance, the couple designed red-and-black flyers with the word "kidnapped" prominently displayed above the photos and names of those abducted, spanning from children to the elderly. These eye-catching posters were intended to grab the public's attention and serve as a visual reminder of the ongoing crisis.The "Kidnapped from Israel" flyers have become emblematic symbols of the Hamas hostages. 
They have been plastered on walls, subways, and telephone poles not only in the US but also in various international cities. Translated into 30 languages, these posters have garnered attention from some notable celebrities, USA Today reported.The posters feature individuals of all ages, from a mother and her two daughters to a 9-month-old Israeli-Argentinian baby and a 40-year-old music festival-goer. Their striking images and personal stories serve as poignant reminders of the crisis.However, the widespread visibility of these flyers has occasionally shed light on the public's differing views concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its intricate history. The creators of the campaign, particularly Dede Bandaid, have witnessed many instances of their posters being torn down in New York, South Florida, London, and Melbourne, Australia.The posters serve as a form of guerrilla public street art, inspired by missing-persons posters commonly seen in the United States. The concept was born from brainstorming sessions in response to the attacks, USA today reported.According to USA Today, due to overwhelming demand for the flyers, the creators launched a dedicated webpage for easy access to downloadable versions. This campaign swiftly gained momentum, with people around the world taking up the cause, using tape and staple guns to spread the flyers in various cities, from San Francisco to New York, Europe, and South America. The posters have made appearances at pro-Israel demonstrations and on college campuses.Approximately two weeks into the campaign, the website now receives around 25,000 daily visitors. It has expanded to include video clips of kidnapped Israelis and testimonials from family members of the hostages. The posters have even been featured on billboards and digital TV trucks in cities like London and Berlin.Videos of individuals removing the flyers, particularly at New York University, have generated controversy and debates. In some cases, those caught tearing down the posters have faced consequences, such as a woman in Boston who was reportedly fired for her actions. A Miami dentist, Ahmed Elkoussa, faced criticism for removing posters and cited concerns about incitement. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

University of Pennsylvania faces backlash over its response to Hamas' attack on Israel; another donor pulls funding

NEW DELHI: The University of Pennsylvania continues to face backlash over its response to Hamas' terror attack on Israel from its donors, the New York Post reported.David Magerman, who helped build Renaissance Technologies, an American hedge fund based in New York, has also pulled his support. He said he is 'deeply ashamed' of being linked to the University, the report further added.Earlier, Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China, stopped sending donations to the University, citing the same reason.Magerman, slammed his alma mater's "misguided moral compass" and said he refused to give another penny to the University.In a letter to President Elizabeth Magill and board chair Scott Bok, he said, "Over the past month, I have been deeply embarrassed by my association with and support for the University of Pennsylvania."The letter was shared on X (previously known as Twitter), in which he further stated, "The leadership of the university has failed to demonstrate the values I expect from an institution that purports to educate young adults and prepare them for a lifetime of leadership and to be emissaries for good in the world."Magerman went on to hammer Magill and Bok for what he described as their "fierce support for the Hamas-affiliated speakers at the Palestine Writes Festival, followed by your equivocating statements about the heinous acts of barbarism perpetrated by the same Hamas you allowed these speakers to promote."This letter came after Apollo CEO Marc Rowan demanded the University's President Elizabeth Magill to resign from her post given her unwillingness to condemn the Hamas attacks. 
Rowan also urged alumni to "close their checkbooks" until the school's leadership changed."The University of Pennsylvania does not condemn as evil the butchers who beheaded babies and kidnapped and rape girls," Magerman wrote in his letter. "This University of Pennsylvania does not consider those actions to be evil and their perpetrators to be evil."He also said that "regardless of the economic and social value of a Penn or Wharton degree, there is no place for self-respecting Jewish people at an institution that supports evil" as he parted ways with equity billionaire Marc Rowan - who called for Magill and Bok to resign.Magerman argued in his letter that dismissal would be "wholly inadequate," claiming: "You have shown me who you are.""My only remaining hope is that all self-respecting Jews, and all moral citizens of the world, disassociate themselves from Penn," he concluded.Meanwhile, Magill said that she had no doubt where she stood in the conflict, as per The New York Post."I, and this university, are horrified by and condemn Hamas's terrorist assault on Israel and their violent atrocities against civilians. There is no justification - none - for these heinous attacks..."Bok also released a statement through the university "condemning the horrific atrocities and expressing solidarity with the Jewish community."

Israel-Hamas war: Meta changing how users can comment on Facebook, and more

In a reaction to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, social media giant Meta is temporarily changing users' default comment settings on Facebook. In a blog post, the company explained that it's making the change to "protect people in the region from potentially unwelcome or unwanted comments." Facebook's temporary comment settings: How will it workThis new change will only allow users' friends or "established followers" to comment on "newly created public Facebook posts". Typically, anyone can comment on publicly viewable Facebook posts by default. 
Apart from Israel, Meta didn't specify the other locations or how many Facebook accounts would be affected by the change. However, the company said that the changes will apply broadly to "people in the region."The company also added that Facebook users, regardless of their location, will have the ability to limit their comments. The popular social media platform will even notify users for whom Meta enables this setting by default. Additionally, the company also said that it's making it easier for Facebook users to bulk delete comments. Facebook has even "disabled the feature that normally displays the first one or two comments under posts in Feed."Why Facebook is making these changesAs tensions surrounding the conflict continue to spill over onto social media, these changes are meant to reduce harassment and potentially toxic comments. Meta also said it's rolling out its profile "lock" tool to Facebook users "in the region." This feature will help users hide some previously public parts of their profile and prevent non-friends from seeing a full-size version of their profile photos.Meta also noted that the company's content moderation practices have unfairly suppressed some accounts posting about the conflict. Users have also lately reported that they have been "shadowbanned" on Instagram for posting content about conditions in Gaza or calling attention to the effects of the ongoing conflict on Palestinians.

Meet Israeli mother-daughter duo freed by Hamas after 50 days

NEW DELHI: Two of the Israeli hostages released by Hamas were Sharon Avigdori and her 12-year-old daughter Noam Avigdori. The duo was abducted while visiting family in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7, when Hamas unleashed the bloodiest attack on Israel.Sharon and Noam were taken hostage along with ten members of their extended family. They also lost several members of their family on that day of the attack.On that day, tragedy struck the Israeli family as several members lost their lives. 
The Jewish family had assembled at the residence of 67-year-old Shoshan Haran in Kibbutz Be'eri during the Sukkot holiday. Among those present were her husband Avshalom, daughter Adi, Adi's husband Tal, and their two young children.According to reports, Sharon Avigdori, a special needs psychologist, is Avshalom's sister. She attended Haran's home for the festival with her daughter, Noam.Upon hearing the sirens on October 7, everyone rushed to their safe rooms. However, the Hamas militants were already at their doorsteps."We woke up early on that Saturday morning and heard there were missiles. We called them, we actually were able to reach Yuval’s mother Shoshan on the phone. She answered us whispering. We didn’t understand why she was whispering. She said they were all together in the panic room," Annalee Milstein, who is married to Shoshan and Avshalom’s son Yuval, said, PEOPLE reported."It’s half past six in the morning. A few minutes later we went into the internal app of the kibbutz and we started seeing people sending live messages and we understood it’s not just a regular missile shooting," Milstein added."We tried to call them [but] they didn’t answer us anymore and then we started texting them. We asked them what’s happening, who is there, if they are okay. They said they were all together in the panic room. They are very scared, they hear gunshots all over, they hear terrorists shouting. They [say they] are in deep trouble and they don’t know if they’ll survive it,” Milstein said.The release of hostages held in Gaza as part of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas brought a sigh of relief to their families. Many believed they were dead after being taken captive following the October 7 attack on Israel's southern territory.The reunions and even the mere news of their return brought tears, and disbelief to relatives and friends, many of whom had lost hope.Hamas since Friday, in exchange for 78 Palestinian prisoners, has released hostages in two batches held captive in embattled Gaza after a tense truce brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, halting a seven-week war that has seen incessant bombardment of the enclave.

Yemen's Houthis released video footage on Monday showing armed men dropping from a helicopter and seizing a cargo ship in the southern Red Sea.According to Reuters, The footage was released by the movement's TV channel Al Masirah a day after the ship was hijacked by the Iran-backed group, who said the ship was linked to Israel.Reportedly, the video shows masked men with arms drop from a helicopter to the deck of the ship. The video  shows the rebels seizing control of the vessel, and raising both the Yemeni and Palestinian flags on board. The Galaxy Leader vessel was sailing from Turkey and reportedly bound for India, when it was hijacked with 52 people onboard. 
Several reports have indicated the potential involvement of Yemen-based Houthi rebels, who previously vowed to target all ships linked to Israel or display its flag in the Red Sea.According to reports from Axios, the Israeli authorities admitted that the Galaxy Leader vessel, which is partly owned by an Israeli company, had been seized by rebels.However, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later contradicted assertions that the ship had Israeli origins.Several media sources have indicated that the ship is under the ownership of Israeli shipping businessman Rami Ungar. The nationality of the crew remains uncertain, with Israel asserting that no nationals are present on the vessel.The Galaxy Leader, flying the flag of the Bahamas, allegedly went unreported to ship tracking services for a span of 26 hours. The incident is believed to have occurred in the Red Sea, where the vessel was reportedly targeted by Houthi forces.Contradictory reports have emerged regarding the number of individuals on board, with Lebanon-based outlet Al Mayadeen stating 52 people and other sources suggesting a crew size of 22."The hijacking of the cargo ship by the Houthis near Yemen in the southern Red Sea is a very serious event on a global level. This is a ship that left Turkey on its way to India with an international civilian crew, without Israelis," Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari was quoted as saying.However, he maintained that the ship was not of Israeli origin. Last week, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi issued a threat to seize shipping in a fervent declaration."Our eyes are open to constantly monitor and search for any Israeli ship in the Red Sea," he said.

NEW DELHI: Republican Presidential candidate Nikki Haley said that the pro-Hamas protesters should be publically identified as most of the companies in the US would not like to hire someone who is inclined toward arms or with a terrorist organisation.Talking about the growing sympathy for the Hamas terror group in the US, the presidential candidate said that one can even expect from the UN but not from the colleges that they will demonstrate in support of them.While talking with the Fox News show, "Hannity," Haley questioned, "Are you telling me that these professors, these college students, are supporting a terrorist organization?"She further stated that Hamas had murdered around 33 Americans and taken at least 20 hostages while the members of the Palestinian governing party chanted "Death to America" and the like.Haley asked whether the Americans who are demonstrating in favor of Hamas or in agreement with Hamas' massacre of Israeli civilians therefore also want America to be destroyed."If they do, every one of them is dangerous to our country… because that's what Hamas preaches, is ‘death to America’. So when they get up there, and they hold those signs, or they get upset on why people won't hire them: it's because companies don't want to hire someone who wants to destroy our country," Haley told Fox News.She continued: "That's why I think every name needs to be … published. 
Every face needs to be published. And we need to call this out for the hate that it is."Haley said that the country has become more antisemitic in the wake of the Hamas invasion, as the Times of Israel reported signage above stores reading "Jews Not Allowed" while Erdogan has called Hamas "freedom fighters" and Israel a "war criminal."However, the foreign ministry in Ankara claimed the Turkish government has not been antisemitic, calling attacks on Erdogan "slander" and saying "Turkiye's (sic) track record on this issue is spotless, unlike many countries that support Israel unconditionally today," in a statement obtained by the Times of Israel.

Assam nurse refuses to leave Tel Aviv, vows wartime service

GUWAHATI: Nurses from northeast serving in Tel Aviv, the economic centre of Israel, are in no mood to return even as Hamas militants targeted the vibrant city on Thursday with a barrage of rockets. Thousands of kilometres away, in a calm northern Assam village - Goruduba - near Thelamora town in Sonitpur district, nurse Bharati Shivakoti's (30) husband Darpan Parajuli is going about his business in his private pharmacy. Since the beginning of the Israel-Palestine conflict, Darpan has been receiving about 10 to 12 phone calls from his wife everyday. 
But neither Bharati has an appeal for the government to evacuate her nor the family in Sonitpur is worried about the immediate consequences of the war. "We hear sirens only sometimes from our place when missiles are fired. There are bunkers where we can hide. But so far, our locality has not been hit by missiles," Bharati, working as a caregiver for senior citizens in Tel Aviv, said in a conversation with her husband.Bharati is a Nepali from Kanglatongbi, Imphal West in Manipur, and married in Assam. After clearing BSc, she pursued nursing in Delhi and grabbed the opportunity to work in Israel three years ago. Nurses from Manipur are most sought after by hospitals in Indian cities but better payment has attracted many of them abroad. While about 18,000 Indians are working as professionals in Israel, a major chunk of them are caregivers to the elderly. A caregiver in Israel is paid between Rs 1.25 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh per month, which is between Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 in India. "Areas in Tel Aviv where Bharati and many other Indian nurses are residing, still have not seen violence. Last time when she called me on Thursday, Bharati was quite confident that the Israeli government will shield them and Tel Aviv. She has no plan to return," Darpan told TOI on Thursday. He said Bharati feels that militants won't be able to penetrate deep into Tel Aviv, even as she went about her day on Thursday as well. Darpan said Bharati's elder sister, uncle and cousin brother are also in nursing sector there. Their daughter is in the hostel of a missionary school in Tezpur and is in touch with her mother."Neither Bharati nor her relatives wants to return as of now. Service to humanity has been their top priority," said Darpan. "Flight operations have been hampered between India and Israel. If the question of safety becomes a grave concern for Indians, we have faith in the Indian government that it will take the right decision at the right time," he added.

NEW DELHI: Kfar Aza, a community near the Gaza Strip, was massacred after a surprise attack by Hamas terrorist infiltrators in Israel on Saturday.In unimaginable cruelty, nearly 70 terrorists invaded the community, leaving behind casualties scattered across the area, including 40 babies and small children - some with their heads chopped off.According to a report in Israel-based i24 News, the smell of death was pervasive in Kfar Aza which has now been opened to the reporters to observe the extent of the destruction following the assault.Israel Defense Forces Major General Itai Veruv characterized the incident as more than a war, labeling it a "massacre".Remnants of families, including babies, mothers, and fathers, were found in their living spaces after the assault.Kfar Aza remains an active zone, with Israeli soldiers alert for potential threats, rockets overhead and distant sounds of mortars and artillery.Reserve soldiers have engaged in the ongoing task of removing bodies in the area though an exact count of victims is not yet available. Soldiers navigated through booby-trapped houses as terrorists' vehicles, potential hazards with rigged explosives, linger as a reminder of the recent events.The attack involved the use of guns, grenades, and knives against civilians in their homes. Kfar Aza, once a peaceful community, is now marked by soccer nets on lawns, abandoned strollers, and damaged sidewalks after houses were burned and residents were compelled to flee.Israel-Hamas conflict: What has happened so far?
Four days following the Hamas assault, the Israeli military declared "full restoration" of control over the border. According to Israel, 1,500 bodies of Hamas militants were discovered within Israeli territory and no Hamas fighters have breached Israel's borders since Monday night. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a military spokesperson, asserted that the Hamas operatives had "nowhere to hide in Gaza," saying that Israel "will reach them everywhere."The Israeli military revised the count of Hamas militants killed to 1,600 as the conflict intensified. The violence has resulted in a death toll exceeding 1,800 individuals, including 1,000 Israelis and nearly 830 Palestinians in Gaza. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Areas around the Israel embassy and those with Jewish establishments in the city have been placed on high alert after an embassy staffer was stabbed in Beijing on Friday. Police are cautious because there have been two attempts - in 2012 and 2021 - on the Israel's embassy and its diplomats in Delhi.In 2012, Tal Yehoshua Koren, wife of the Israeli defence attache and an embassy staffer, was seriously injured in a car blast in Chanakyapuri. In January 2021, a low intensity blast outside the Israeli embassy on APJ Abdul Kalam Road had sent shockwaves through the security apparatus because it had taken place during the Beating Retreat ceremony on Kartavya Path.Overall, security in Delhi was tightened from Thursday amid fear of violent protests against the Israeli retaliation to the Hamas attack. 
An intelligence input in this regard was conveyed on Thursday evening, following which the cops carried out extensive patrolling in sensitive areas like Jama Masjid, Seelampur, Jafrabad and Jamia Nagar. "Deployment was stepped up ahead of the Friday prayers and security was upped at Jewish establishments too," said a police officer.The officer added, "We have boosted the presence of uniformed officers at major gatherings and cultural sites to prioritise public safety, exercising an abundance of caution. To enhance security, we have advised religious centres to restrict access to their premises, ensure the functionality of security cameras and alarms, conduct perimeter sweeps and screen mail and packages."An input conveyed to the district police on Thursday night said that some organisations could stage a protest/demonstration in different places in the city from Friday onwards following the war between Israel and Hamas."The protesters may gather all over Delhi and owing to such large gatherings, the devotees are likely to spill over on to the adjoining roads and parks. There is also apprehension that some organisations may gather at the Chabad Houses/ Jewish Community Centres and other important Jewish establishments in Delhi," the input said. "Keeping in view the present scenario, adequate arrangements may be made by the local police, police control room and traffic police."State authorities in Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh and Goa have also been asked to ensure security to Israeli diplomats, staff and tourists, sources said. This comes after many countries, including the US, UK, France and Germany, have enhanced security around "potential Jewish targets" and "pro-Palestinian protesters" in view of the escalating situation in the aftermath of the call for "Global Day of Jihad" by former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.

NEW DELHI: In a distressing incident near the Gaza Strip, 25-year-old Israeli student Noa Argamani was abducted during a trance music festival that marked the conclusion of the Jewish holiday Sukkot, reported the New York Post. The incident unfolded when Hamas terrorists unleashed gunfire and launched rockets into the crowd causing panic and chaos.The harrowing scene was captured in a video released by Noa Argamani's family, which depicted the terrifying moments leading to her abduction. In the video, Argamani can be seen being forcibly taken away on a Palestinian gunman's motorcycle, all the while pleading, "Don't kill me!
 No, no, no."Meanwhile, her boyfriend, Avi Nathan, was also confronted and manhandled by the terrorists.The footage of this kidnapping quickly circulated on various social media platforms, raising concerns and outrage among the public.Subsequently, Avi Nathan's brother, Moshe Or, reported him as missing, prompting emergency response teams to intensify their efforts in locating the abducted couple. The emergence of the video further heightened the urgency of the situation, as authorities work diligently to secure the safe return of Noa Argamani and Avi Nathan.This incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing tensions in the region and the challenges faced by individuals living in proximity to conflict zones. Authorities and international organisations continue to monitor the situation closely and are actively engaged in efforts to resolve this distressing situation and ensure the well-being of the kidnapped individuals."We were worried and tried to call. His phone was unavailable and so was hers," Israel National News reported, as per the New York Post."I can't imagine what's going through her mind - screaming in panic, when some scumbags are holding her and not letting her go," said Or.Israel has suffered over 300 deaths and nearly 1,600 have been wounded in a sudden attack from Hamas in the worst onslaught the country has witnessed in five decades. As Israel battles Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to take "mighty vengeance" against the outfit. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'Putin's plan to profit from the Israel-Hamas war'

NEW DELHI: On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since the deadly Hamas attack on October 7. During the conversation, Putin briefed Netanyahu on discussions he had with leaders from the region and the Palestinian Authority.The Russian President also said he was ready to "coordinate efforts with all constructive partners to put an end to hostilities and stabilise the situation as quickly as possible".For some observers, Netanyahu must have been disappointed with 'dear friend' Putin's call. According to a report in the Economist, Netanyahu, who has visited Russia a dozen times in recent years, must have been surprised that it took Russia's president nine days to pick up the phone.As per the Economist, Russia's ever-growing relations with Iran were already causing discomfort in Israel. Now, both Russia and Iran are likely to be clear beneficiaries of the Israel-Hamas war."A wider war would probably bring two benefits to both Russia and Iran. 
The first would be a spike in oil and gas prices that would help both ailing economies and give Mr Putin extra money to fund his war in Ukraine. The second would be to disrupt America's plans for the Middle East," the Economist report said."As oil prices go up, this enables them to continue spending on arms production and it also helps them cover some budget deficits," Ann Marie Dailey, a policy researcher at Rand Corporation, told Bloomberg. "Russia absolutely gains an advantage from this in the short-term."Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that President Vladimir Putin's goals "will be reached sooner" if the US shifts its focus to the Israel conflict and slows down its arms supplies to Ukraine.According to two sources, who spoke to Bloomberg on condition of anonymity due to the delicate nature of the matter, Russia stands to benefit from the war between Israel and Hamas. The sources told Bloomberg that the conflict could divert US and European attention away from the war in Ukraine, even though Russia is worried about its escalation.However, if Hezbollah joins the Israel-Hamas war, it may complicate things for everyone. It may force the US to get directly involved in the war and then no one knows how the conflict will unfold. So, a limited Israel-Hamas war is surely likely to benefit Russia and Putin in the short term but a wider regional conflict could turn out to be a black swan event with uncertain outcomes.

After Biden, Rishi Sunak plans Israel visit amidst escalating conflict with Hamas: report

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to embark on a diplomatic mission to the Israel this week, as reported by Sky News. While Downing Street has not officially confirmed the visit, it is anticipated that Sunak will be making his way to the region following calls with world leaders concerning the Israel-Gaza conflict.The move comes amidst escalating tensions in the region, with concerns about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza mounting. The conflict began when Hamas launched a surprise assault on Israel on October 7, resulting in the deaths of at least 1,400 people and thousands more injured. 
In the subsequent days, Israel responded with retaliatory air strikes on Gaza, cutting off essential supplies, including fuel, water, food, and medical aid. The situation has been dire, especially for the over two million people living in the cramped territory.The international community has been closely monitoring the situation, with visits from world leaders such as Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden. President Biden is set to visit Israel and Jordan, meeting with regional leaders to address the ongoing conflict and prevent it from spiraling into a wider regional issue.While details of Sunak's itinerary are yet to be officially confirmed, it is reported that his discussions will focus on efforts to de-escalate the crisis and prevent further bloodshed in the region. Sunak has been in touch with leaders from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, emphasizing the importance of finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Furthermore, discussions are underway to secure the release of hostages and ensure the safe passage of humanitarian aid to alleviate the humanitarian suffering in Gaza.The British Prime Minister's support for Israel's right to defend itself against attacks by Hamas is balanced with a call for the protection of civilians. The death toll in Gaza has continued to rise, with the conflict taking an increasingly devastating toll on Palestinian civilians.In addition to calls for de-escalation and humanitarian support, there are unconfirmed reports that Prime Minister Sunak may extend his visit to include stops in Jordan and Egypt. The international community is closely watching these developments, hopeful that diplomatic efforts will lead to a more stable and peaceful situation in the region.Meanwhile, the tragic news emerged that one of the two British sisters who went missing during the Hamas attack, Yahel Sharabi, aged 13, has been killed, highlighting the human toll of this conflict. Prime Minister Sunak has vowed to support the protection of British nationals and take steps to assist those affected by the violence, both in the region and at home.

MUMBAI: Friday's Dhanteras mahurat heralds the five-day festival of Diwali, the biggest celebration of the Hindu almanac. Jewellers and diamantaires are optimistic of robust sales as the value of the yellow metal continues to appreciate with each passing year.Kanaya Kakad, skill development director of IBJA (India Bullion Jewellery Association) said, "At Dhanteras 2022, the price of gold was Rs 50,000 per 10 gm. This year it is Rs 60,000. Which other investment grows by Rs 10,000 in a single year?
 Given war and conflict in Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Palestine and China-Taiwan, rates are expected to rise further in coming months. Gold is the only stable investment in an uncertain world. Moreover, hallmarking has increased public confidence in its purity. Gold also provides ready cash at current rates whenever buyers decide to sell."The mood was upbeat at Om Jewellers along LT Road, Borivli. Chief operations manager Madhavi Phatak said, "Thursday's rate for 24 carat gold was Rs 6.085 per gm and 22 carat gold was Rs 5,520. This Diwali we have devised a range of lightweight jewellery as well as heavy bridal ornaments for the wedding season in December. The festive mood is palpable. A lot of Diwali shopping is under way in Borivli so we are confident of a good season. Both 'shagun' buyers and marriage parties will make purchases."The diamond industry echoes that sentiment. Colin Shah, founder and MD of Kama Jewelry, said, "The price for rounds and fancy diamonds showed a positive trend following a year of decline. The diamond industry is expected to vastly expand sales volumes given the upcoming festive and marriage season. CAIT estimates 30 lakh weddings in coming weeks. International gold rates have now dropped marginally, and this has come at an opportune time for the Indian buyer because Dhanteras-Diwali is here. So this is a good time to buy."Lab grown diamonds are the trend of the day, says Ashok Minawala of Danabhai Jewellers. "We have just launched our own brand and I am personally amazed by the robust response. In April we had expected gold rates to rise to Rs 65,000 by Diwali 2023. That has not occurred yet, but the day is not far. This year will be good -- there is nothing to keep us from faring well. People have already started shopping as they believe it is a good omen to buy new things for Dhanteras and Lakshmi Puja," he said.Ashok Gajera, proprietor of Laxmi Diamonds headquartered in Bharat Diamond Bourse, BKC, said, "The Indian economy has been growing from strength to strength, and this festive season is reflective of the fact that Indians' affinity for gold remains steadfast."Vipul Shah, charman of apex trade body Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), said, "The festive season has launched with a strong start. Retailers are reporting double-digit increase in demand. As we approach Diwali, this positive trend may gain momentum driven by about 35 lakh weddings in coming months. Plain gold and studded jewellery remains strong in the bridal segment. Gen Z including working women and self-purchasers prefer minimalist gold jewellery. Diamond jewellery also enjoys high demand."

Will Israel-Hamas conflict impact assembly elections?

The poll body has announced the schedule for Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram assembly elections.Polling for the states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana, and Mizoram will be conducted on various dates between November 7 and 30. The voting process will commence with all 40 assembly seats in Mizoram and the first phase of 20 seats in Chhattisgarh on November 7. Subsequently, the remaining 70 seats in Chhattisgarh will be contested on November 17, coinciding with the polling for all 230 seats in Madhya Pradesh. Rajasthan's 200 assembly seats will be up for voting on November 23, followed by the 119-member Telangana Assembly on November 30.The culmination of this electoral exercise will be the counting of votes for all five states on December 3, chief election commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar said at a press conference on Monday.This will be the last set of assembly elections ahead of the next year's Lok Sabha polls.The announcement of assembly poll dates comes amid intense fighting between Israeli security forces and Hamas militants in Israel's border areas. On Monday, Israel's military announced that its forces had gained "control of communities" in the southern region near Gaza, following a surprise attack by Hamas militants two days earlier.Israel has not released an official toll but its media said at least 700 people were killed in Saturday's attacks, children among them. 
Military spokesperson Daniel Hagari called it "the worst massacre of innocent civilians in Israel's history." Additionally, Palestinian militant groups have claimed to hold over 130 captives from the Israeli side.But can the Israel-Hamas conflict impact assembly elections in India? The conflict has already upended oil economics and geopolitics.Oil prices experienced a sharp increase following an unexpected attack by Hamas on Israel, introducing fresh instability to the Middle East. Since the conflict between Israel and the militant group Hamas escalated over the weekend, the death toll has surpassed 1,100. In response to the crisis, US futures surged by up to 5.4% in New York, briefly surpassing $87 a barrel.Oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Monday said that India was closely monitoring the Israel-Hamas conflict."India will approach this situation with maturity. The area where the conflict is unfolding holds significant importance in the global energy landscape. We will observe the developments closely," Puri said during a press conference in New Delhi.Puri further added, "We will navigate through this challenge. Such uncertainties only reinforce the need for transitioning to sustainable and cleaner fuel options."Increased oil prices often result in a rise in inflation and hinder growth in major importing countries such as India."The fallout in markets will likely be determined by whether conflict spreads to the rest of the Middle East region, with oil traders also shifting focus to Iran, which is both a major oil producer and supporter of Hamas," Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC securities, said.It's too early to draw definitive conclusions, and the outcome hinges on the evolving dynamics of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Whether it escalates to involve regional powers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran remains uncertain.At present, the upcoming assembly elections seem to revolve around state-specific matters and the intricacies of Indian politics. However, an extended Israel-Hamas conflict coupled with elevated oil prices causing persistent inflation might introduce an additional variable into the electoral equation.

Stuck in combat zone, Indian couple struggle for medicines

CHENNAI: Vijayakumar, 64, and his wife Usha Devi, 59, are in a rare mix of relief and tension. Relief because they are with their daughter; tension because they find themselves in a war zone. The couple from Thiruvananthapuram had travelled to Israel last month to spend time with their daughter Anagha, who is pursuing her PhD at Bar Ilan University, Tel Aviv, and are now stuck in a raging war after Palestinian militant groups unleashed aerial attacks on Israel on Saturday.Their neighbourhood was relatively peaceful, and Vijayakumar, who has high blood pressure and a prostate problem, stepped out with his wife and Anagha's classmate Manoj Shanmugasundaram on Monday to buy medicines. 
"We were at a bus stop when sirens went off," Vijayakumar told TOI over phone from a bomb shelter in Tel Aviv. They ran into an apartment complex, but the gates were closed. "There was nobody there and we waited in the corridor for a while before going back to the university where we were living with our daughter," said Usha.  The university gates were also closed, and the security personnel had moved into the bomb shelter. We called the security and waited outside. We could hear explosions. Those were some tense moments."The couple were supposed to return to India on Sunday. Since Air India cancelled its flights, they got stuck in Israel."Here the roads are almost empty. We have seen such attacks on television, this is the first time we are seeing it in real life. Our daughter is breaking down thinking about our safety," said Usha Rani.Vijayakumar said he is in dire need of medicines. "Unlike in India, here it's difficult to get medicines. When I called the Indian embassy here, the response was poor as they themselves are in bunkers. It would be great if some Indian association in Israel gets me medicines," said Vijayakumar.Eswaran Lakshmanan from Palani in Tamil Nadu, who is doing his post-doctoral fellowship in a university in Kiryat Ono in Tel Aviv, told TOI how he saw missiles from their balcony. "I have been here for the past four years. In 2021, there was a similar situation. But it came under control in a week. Now I am in a bomb shelter," he said.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

VARANASI: While celebrating Diwali, a group of Muslim women sang in praise of Lord Rama and performed aarti at Vishal Bharat Sansthan in Lamahi in Varanasi on Sunday.They sang, "Ayodhya hai humare jiyaratgah ka naam, Rahate hain wahan Imam-e-Hind Shri Ram", (Ayodhya is the name of our pilgrimage, where lives Imam of Hind Shri Ram)".The group leader and president of Muslim Mahila Foundation Nazneen Ansari believes in cultural and social amalgamation of Hindus and Muslims through such events. "Shri Ram is our ancestor. We can change our name and religion, but how we can change our ancestor," she wondered adding, "Singing in praise of Lord Ram not only bridges the gap between Hindus and Muslms, but also reflects the generosity of Islam."The darkness of unrighteousness vanishes with the light of Ram's name. 
There is a need to spread the name of Ram everywhere. Those who are away from Ram are forced to resort to violence. Palestine and Israel are shedding blood among themselves, she said, adding, both need to follow the path of Lord Ram, only then peace can come.Only "Ramrajya" can take the world towards peace. “We are Indians, hence it is our duty to believe in Indian culture and take it forward. We are Muslims but will never accept Arabic culture. Muslims will be respected only if they remain connected to their ancestors”, she said.Najma Parveen, a Muslim woman who did her PhD on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said that this effort of Muslim women is going to strengthen mutual relations and give the message of peace. "Lord Shri Ram is the only support who can remove hatred from anyone's heart. In times of violence and unrighteousness, only the name of Lord Ram can take one on the path of righteousness," she said.The event was attended by Archana Bharatvanshi, Razia Sultana, Shabana Begum, Shama Afroz, Reshma Qureshi, Razia, Jaliya Begum, Nagina Begum, Rabina, Shamshunnisha, Sonam, Mridula Jaiswal, Abha Bharatvanshi, and others.With the "aarti thaal", the women performed aarti of Lord Rama and recited Hanuman Chalisa and prayer to give a message of communal harmony. The tradition of Shri Rama aarti has been continuing since 2006 when the Sankat Mochan temple was rocked by a terrorist blast. Since then Nazneen and her group members have been performing aarti and reciting prayers on occasions of Hindu festivals like Ram Navami and Diwali. These women believe that the message from Kashi can play a vital role in strengthening communal harmony in the society. Nazneen also scripted "Shri Ram Aarti", "Shri Ram Prarthana", "Durga Chalisa" and translated "Hanuman Chalisa" and "Ramcharitmanas" into Urdu. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

PM Modi welcomes Israel-Hamas deal, G20 7-point agreement

NEW DELHI: With Israel and Hamas reaching a deal for the release of some hostages and prisoners as well as a four-day pause in fighting, PM Modi on Wednesday expressed hope that all hostages would be released soon and reiterated his condemnation of terrorism and civilian deaths.Addressing the virtual G20 summit, Modi underscored the significance of “timely and uninterrupted” humanitarian aid in Gaza, while also calling for efforts to ensure that the Israel-Hamas fighting didn’t turn into a wider regional conflict.Foreign minister S Jaishankar later said an overwhelming number of countries, but not all, spoke explicitly about the two-state solution and that there was no consensus on it.The Israel-Hamas issue, not surprisingly, dominated the proceedings at the virtual interaction, almost pushing Russia's war on Ukraine to the background.The Russia-Ukraine conflict did figure, but not as the main concern, and was, in fact, used by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was absent from the G20 Summit in Delhi in September, to push back at the West's criticism of his aggression against Kyiv.When European leaders called the Russian aggression in Ukraine “shocking”, Putin responded by saying military actions were always a tragedy for “specific people, specific families, and the country as a whole’’. Significantly, Putin also said “we must think about how to stop this tragedy”.Referring to the Israel-Hamas conflict, he said, “Isn’t the extermination of the civilian population in Palestine, in the Gaza Strip, shocking today?
 Isn’t it shocking that the secretary general of the United Nations said that Gaza has turned into a huge children’s cemetery.”In his opening remarks, Modi told the G20 leaders that new challenges had appeared in the past few months and lack of security and instability in the West Asia region was a cause of concern for all.“Our coming together symbolises that we are all sensitive to issues and standing together to resolve them. We believe that terrorism is unacceptable to all of us. The death of civilians, no matter where it takes place, is condemnable,’’ he said.“Despite the clouds of crisis looming, One Family (a theme of India’s presidency) has the power to together work for peace. From the human welfare perspective, we can raise our voice against terrorism and violence and in favour of humanity. India is ready to work hand-in-hand with others to fulfil these expectations of the world and humanity,’’ he added.Israel had earlier in the day announced that 50 hostages — women and children — will be released over four days, during which fighting will remain paused. It also said the release of every 10 additional hostages would result in one additional day of truce. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

5.5k km from war zone, Muslim students sing harmony song in Kol's Jewish schools

KOLKATA: At Jewish Girls' School on Park Street, around two dozen senior students - some attired in skirts, others in slacks - practice their moves ahead of the annual concert next month. The girls, of whom nine out of 10 are Muslims, dance merrily to the catchy tune of the Jewish folk song 'Hava Nagila'.At another school, Elias Meyer School & Talmud Torah, in Bowbazar, the boys - again, mostly Muslims - look forward to Jewish festivals like Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, as much as they do Eid-ul-Adha and Eid-ul-Fitr. It's a matter of sadness that Passover is no longer a holiday.Outside both schools, women in burqas and men in skullcaps wait to collect their wards after school. 
Yasmeen, who has come to pick up her daughter from the Park Street address, is a former student.These two schools in the heart of the city are perfect examples where hope and harmony triumphs over hate. "The idea of Muslim students in a Jewish school is not out of place here, in Kolkata. I was a student at Jewish Girls' around 25 years ago. Now, my daughter goes to the school. Though I hail from a conservative family, we have never had an issue about going to a school run by Jewish people," says Nasima, who lives nearby, on Elliot Road. The doors of the two Jewish schools in Kolkata were opened to other communities around the same time that Israel was formed, seven decades ago. "Since the 1960s, there have been no Jewish students at these schools. Though open to students of all faiths, Muslims make up over 90% of the 1,500 students at Jewish Girls' and 500-odd at Elias Meyer," says Brian Auckland, one of the members of the Jewish board that runs the two institutions.The dwindling Jewish community in Kolkata has less than 20 members now, all of them elderly.David Askhenazy, another board member, says that while the school still has Jewish traditions, including holiday on the Sabbath, there is no discrimination. "Like everyone, we pray for peace in Israel and Palestine. But we don't hold prayer meets in schools because we don't want to burden the students with anything beyond studies," he says. Jewish Girls' School principal Abeda Razeq, who studied here in the 1980s and '90s and since then a teacher, says the school is a beacon of interfaith cooperation. "We symbolise a harmonious co-existence the world deserves," she says. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Pune: Research think tank Pune International Centre has sought feedback from the students of the Gokhale Institute of Politics & Economics on securing the country’s economic growth by inviting research papers from postgraduate and doctoral students.
The selected papers will be presented to Chief of Army Staff General Manoj Pande in a conference. The Gokhale Institute has received 35 papers, from which six will be short-listed and three declared winners. 
The initiative of the think thank is part of the eighth Pune Dialogue on national security. The conference will be held on Monday and Tuesday.
The Union minister for petroleum and natural gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, is scheduled to speak at the conference along with economists, including chairperson of the high-level advisory group on trade Surjit Bhalla and vice-chancellor of Gokhale Institute Ajit Ranade. 
The Pune International Centre is planning to continue with the initiative of inviting papers from Gokhale Institute.
Earlier, the Pune International Centre had given its inputs to the government on several geo-political issues such as China-Pakistan economic corridor and situation in Afghanistan, highlighting the impact they will have on India.
While India is on the cusp of promoting itself as a global player, the country also faces several economic threats pertaining to supply of critical minerals and technology, Lt Gen Vinayak Patankar (retired), the trustee of the Pune International Centre said. 
The impact of geo-political tensions due to Russia-Ukraine and Palestine-Israel conflicts on oil imports would be relevant to India’s economic growth, he said.
“Soon after the Ukraine-Russia war, people started to understand the economic impact of the conflict. If it is hitting the European Union, it will also impact the USA and the overall global economy. India’s neighbour China on its part has thrown its lot with Russia. We need to be mindful of it,” Patankar said.

Kannur apparel firm not to accept new orders from Israel

Kochi: Maryan Apparel, which has been making uniforms for Israel's police and prison officials at its unit in Koothuparamba, Kannur, since 2015, has decided not to accept any new order from the West Asian nation until the conflict ends, due to "moral reasons".
Company's managing director Thomas Olickal said they felt it was not right to take new orders when a war was on. 
He, however, added the company had no political leanings on the subject, and they were ready to take Israel's orders again once the war was over. He also said all existing orders would be delivered promptly.
"We took the decision after seeing reports on the war, especially the one on the deaths of women and children at a hospital in Gaza which caused us severe pain. Although both sides are denying their roles in it, we thought it is better on our part not to have a direct or indirect connection with it. We are stopping the business agreement only till the war is over as it's a moral responsibility. We don't have any affinity towards either side. If Palestine gives us an order now, we won't take that either," he said.
The company was providing three coloured shirts dark navy, sky blue and light green to different sections of the Israeli police force apart from uniforms for prison personnel. It was also given an order for 12,000 pieces of stretchable olive-green pants for training purposes.
"All previous orders will be intact, and we will deliver them promptly. The production of fabric for their training uniforms is going on now. We will complete the work by November-December and deliver it as per their order," he said.
Olickal said that after the Hamas attack, Israeli authorities had informed them that they would need more quantity.
"We are not at all anti-Israel. We don't have any such politics. We have no problem in continuing to associate with Israeli authorities once the war is over. We have a very good relationship with them, and we believe they would accept our decision. We are only letting them know our sentiments," he said.

Three law students from Harvard and Columbia universities have lost their job offers from a leading US law firm, Davis Polk, after they signed statements about the Hamas-Israel conflict that the firm disagreed with.The email announcing the decision, signed by Neil Barr, said that the student statements were "simply contrary to our firm's values". According to an NBC report, Joseph Gerstel, a small-business lawyer, shared a screenshot of the email on LinkedIn on Tuesday."The views expressed in certain of the statements signed by law school student organizations in recent days are in direct contravention of our firm's value system. For this reason and to ensure we continue to maintain a supportive and inclusive work environment, the student leaders responsible for signing on to these statements are no longer welcome in our firm; and their offers of employment have thus been rescinded," the firm letter said.The email did not name the students or the statements they signed.As per a report in the Insider, a New York University law student also lost a job offer from Winston & Strawn, a leading law firm, over the statement on the Israel-Hamas conflict. The statement, which was sent to the NYU Student Bar Association, said that Israel was "entirely responsible" for the "massive death toll."The students are not the only ones who are facing backlash for their views on the war. 
Some tech leaders withdrew from a major industry event in Europe after the summit's CEO denounced Israel.Last week, several public statements emerged from university groups supporting Palestinians and blaming Israel for the recent Israel-Hamas conflict, which started after a surprise Hamas attack on Israel killed over 1,300 people. These statements have caused uproar on college campuses and in corporate America.On October 10, The Harvard Crimson, a student-run news outlet at the university, reported that more than 30 Harvard student groups signed a letter that said Israel was "entirely responsible" for "all unfolding violence" in the conflict.Since then, many CEOs, business leaders and a federal judge have reacted by severing ties with the university, demanding to know who signed the letter or saying they would not employ them.Some prominent donors have also ended their relationship with Harvard over the letter, including the Wexner Foundation - co-founded by Leslie Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret.

External affairs minister S Jaishankar calls for Global South self-reliance

NEW DELHI: While change is the natural order, there continues to be a resistance for a greater role for the Global South in shaping solutions for the key issues of our times, foreign minister S Jaishankar said addressing the second Global South summit India hosted on Friday.The minister said that the Global South needed to work towards self-reliance to mitigate vulnerabilities related to economic concentrations. "We need to not only democratise and diversify production, but build resilient and reliable supply chains and promote local solutions. Only then can the Global South secure its future," he said.The summit saw participation by close to 130 countries and deliberations on issues like development, finance, health, education and environment. 
There were talks also on the need to find ways to deal with terrorism. Apart from PM Narendra Modi, many other leaders in their intervention condemned the Hamas terror attacks on Israel and the killing of civilians, apart from calling for humanitarian aid to Palestine.Modi said that the participation by so many countries in the second Global South summit this year showed that the developing world was seeking autonomy and was ready to play a much bigger role in global affairs.The PM also inaugurated the Global South Centre of Excellence, which India had proposed earlier for research on issues related to the developing world. He also proposed an annual international conference to focus on the priorities of the Global South.The message from the summit is that Global South wants its voice in global governance, Modi said.Jaishankar said that India reaffirmed its commitment to the Global South through an extensive range of development projects in 78 countries and that these projects are demand driven, outcome oriented, transparent and sustainable."I assure you that this will only expand in its scale and scope in the times ahead. We will always welcome your views, suggestions and proposals in this context. As India embraces digital delivery, promotes green growth and ensures affordable health access, it will always have the Global South at the centre of its international partnerships."All of us are acutely aware of the growing stress on the international economy and global society. Longstanding structural inequities have been seriously aggravated by the devastation of the Covid pandemic. This has been made still worse by the fuel, food and fertiliser crises emanating from the Ukraine conflict and its responses. Resource challenges, financial constraints, disrupted trade and climate events have added to our burdens. As a result, growth prospects are as daunting as the SDG landscape is grim," he added.

Prime Minister Modi may attend World Climate Action Summit during COP28 in Dubai

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to attend the two-day World Climate Action Summit (WCAS), beginning December 1, during the 28th session of the UN climate conference (COP28) in Dubai and may pitch for the country's approach to deal with the critical environmental issues through Mission LiFE (lifestyle for environment) which got wider acceptance here at G20 leaders' summit in September.The UAE under its presidency of COP28 will host three high-level events focused on the global stocktake (GST), covering mitigation, adaptation, and the means of implementation of various climate actions at the Summit.Though the official announcement of Modi's visit is still awaited, sources said that the Prime Minister is most likely to be there for the Summit. Environment minister Bhupender Yadav is also expected to attend the COP28 and participate in key negotiations during its high-level segment.  The COP28, scheduled to be held during November 30-December 12, will conclude the first ever GST -- analysis of voluntary climate actions taken by over 195 countries as per their commitments under the Paris Agreement -- and may also adopt the mechanism to operationalise ‘loss and damage’ fund which is meant for supporting developing countries, primarily the least developed ones, impacted by climate change.Sharing the basic agenda of the WCAS on December 1-2, Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, COP28 president-designate and UAE special envoy for climate change, in his letter to all member countries, this month said, "These events are mandated to be chaired by the high-level committee and are intended to provide political guidance for the consideration of outputs phase of the GST. 
The high-level committee will issue a summary of the events on December 3, capturing key political messages delivered by heads of state and government."Though it is not yet clear who all among the heads of state/government may attend the Summit during COP28, it is expected that the US president Joe Biden, the UK prime minister Rishi Sunak and the French President Emmanuel Macron will be among the global leaders who attend the meet with Modi in Dubai to give a political momentum to the crucial climate summit.Their presence at a common platform in West Asia will be quite significant as the UN climate conference this year is going to be held at a time when the world is quite divided on the issue of Israel-Palestine war in Gaza.Sensing an urgency as the escalation of Israel's ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza will provide a grim backdrop to COP28, Al Jaber had last month urged countries to unite for the cause of climate, saying their responsibility is only greater in “such challenging times with tension and discord between countries and within countries”."There are too many things dividing our world at this moment. Now more than ever, we need to unite on climate and deliver a clear message of hope, solidarity, stability and prosperity,” said Al Jaber while delivering his opening remarks at pre-COP in Abu Dhabi (UAE) on October 30.

NEW DELHI: Popular Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie’s father Jon Voight has criticized his daughter for her comments against Israel amid the ongoing war. He took to social media platform ‘X’ on Saturday to express his "disappointment" with her daughter’s anti-Israel stance.In a video titled ‘truth and lies’, shared on X, with the American flag in the background, Voight said, "I am very disappointed that my daughter, like so many, has no understanding of God's honour, God's truths. This is about destroying the history of God's land - the Holy Land - the land of the Jews. 
This is justice for God's children of the holy land," he continued. "The Israeli army must protect thy soil, thy people. This is war. It's not going to be what the left thinks, it can't be civil now."Jolie had criticised the Israeli campaign in Gaza as "the deliberate bombing of a trapped population" and "murder", on her social media handles."What happened in Israel is an act of terror. But that cannot justify the innocent lives lost in bombing a civilian population in Gaza that has nowhere to go, no access to food or water, no possibility of evacuation, and not even the basic human right to cross a border to seek refuge," she had said.In one of her posts, Angelina stated that Gaza "fast becoming a mass grave" due to Israel's airstrikes. She also stated that "the world watches" as "millions of Palestinian civilians - children, women, and families - are being collectively punished".  Another post featured a photo that seemed to depict a recent Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip."This is the deliberate bombing of a trapped population who have nowhere to flee. Gaza has been an open-air prison for nearly two decades and is fast becoming a mass grave," she wrote. "By refusing to demand a humanitarian ceasefire and blocking the UN Security Council from imposing one on both parties, world leaders are complicit in these crimes," she added.Voight also wrote: "The Israeli army has to protect the land of Israel and its people, this is a war. It will not be as the left thinks it will be, it will not be cultural. Israel was attacked through inhumane terrorism, innocent children, mothers, fathers, and grandparents. And you, fools, say that Israel is the problem? You need to look at yourselves and ask: 'Who am I? What am I?”.Voight concluded the video by urging people to "recognise that Hamas" was "destroying their own people, not Israel”. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Gold sales have seen a significant surge during the festive season, despite the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Leading jewelers such as Malabar Gold & Diamonds, PNG Jewellers, and Senco Gold & Diamonds have reported an increase in sales of up to 30% during Dussehra-Navratri compared to the previous year, according to an ET report. This is despite a 5.5% increase in gold prices since the outbreak of the Israel-Palestine conflict.Silver prices have also been on the rise since the 'adhik maas' period (July-August) and this trend continues. 
Gold prices, which were at Rs 57,415 per 10 gm before the attacks by Hamas, have now reached Rs 60,612 in the past two weeks.Saurabh Gadgil, managing director of PNG Jewellers, stated that the upward trend in sales has been visible since the month of Shraadh and has intensified during Navratri. PNG Jewellers, which operates 42 stores in Maharashtra and Goa, expects a 30% increase in sales compared to the previous Dussehra. The demand for necklaces, bangles, and heavy wedding jewelry has been particularly high.Titan's jewelry division has also witnessed a 19% increase in sales from July to September, attributed to "healthy wedding and high-value studded purchases," among other factors. CaratLane, in which Titan has a 98.3% stake, reported a 45% surge in sales during the same period. Over 3.5 million weddings are anticipated between now and the end of March 2024.The anticipation of further price increases if the Gaza conflict spreads has also driven gold sales. Malabar Gold, headquartered in Kerala with a pan-India presence, reported an 18% increase in sales during Dussehra compared to the previous year. MP Ahammed, chairman of Malabar Gold, attributed this growth to strong consumer demand and steady retail expansion.In price-sensitive Eastern India, Senco has experienced a 10-15% growth in gold jewelry sales compared to the previous Dussehra. Sales of diamond jewelry have increased by 20%, according to Suvankar Sen, managing director of Senco.Bullion dealers have also noted a resurgence in investment and physical retail demand. Prithviraj Kothari, managing director of RiddiSiddhi Bullions, stated that the fundamental and technical landscape for gold has improved, with a long-term bullish view. Kothari expects prices to trade at least 10% higher from current levels by next year. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israel will cut all connections with Gaza after Hamas is ousted, says foreign minister Eli Cohen

NEW DELHI: Gaza's post-war future looks bleak as Israel is planning to "cut all connections" with the Strip after Hamas is ousted. In a briefing to reporters, Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen said there would be “no trade connections, and no connection for the passage of people and workers".Before the war, thousands of Palestinian workers from Gaza entered Israel every day, while Gazan residents needing treatment in Israeli hospitals also were allowed to enter the country. Israel has also supplied water and electricity to the Hamas-run territory for many years.In order to make up the shortfall in the labour market, Cohen said he has signed two agreements with foreign countries, including Sri Lanka, to bring thousands of foreign workers to Israel in the immediate future, and that similar agreements with other countries would follow quickly.A 2022 UN report estimated Gaza Strip's unemployment rate to be 45%, and 80% of the population depends on international aid for survival. 
The main trade partners of the Gaza Strip are Israel and Egypt. If Israel follows through with its plan of cutting all ties with Gaza, then most residents of the Strip will be pushed into poverty, said experts.International pressure on Israel growingMeanwhile, international pressure on Israel to curb military operation in Gaza is increasing and the 'window of legitimacy' for the ongoing airstrikes and ground invasion is likely to start closing in another 2-3 weeks.Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen said diplomatic pressure had begun to increase, but did not specify whether such pressure included demands for a ceasefire or only greater action to aid civilians in the Strip.He said the “diplomatic window” for the IDF campaign in Gaza will likely remain open for another two or three weeks before the pressure becomes significant.Some countries have already made discreet requests for a ceasefire and such requests might be made more publicly in the coming weeks. Cohen, however, said Israel is determined to continue combat operations until it achieves its goals: to eliminate Hamas and save the 240 hostages it holds.The minister said that the holding of hostages by Hamas is lending international legitimacy to the war against the terror group, and generating greater global understanding of Israel’s insistence on continuing to fight.“The world accepts that Israel will not stop until it frees the captives,” he said.Cohen added that Israel was also working with European nations to create a “maritime humanitarian corridor” with Gaza to provide equipment and supplies to the territory, and that such a corridor might soon begin operation.Eight countries have so far curbed diplomatic ties with Israel over the ongoing conflict, including Bulgaria, Turkey, South Africa, Jordan, Colombia, Chile, Honduras, and Chad. Another 14 have been labelled as 'wavering states' and Israel is in close contact with all of them to ensure diplomatic ties remain strong, said Cohen For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Politics of appeasement doesn't see terror for what it is: Modi

VADODARA: Ahead of the assembly polls in five states, PM Modi on Tuesday sharpened his broadside against his political opponents, saying that the politics of appeasement and lethargic approach in punishing terrorists has been the biggest obstacle in India's journey of development."The last many decades in India are witness to the fact that appeasers never see terrorism and its monstrosity for what they were. Appeasers don't hesitate to stand by enemies of humanity. Politics of appeasement is biggest hurdle in India's development," the PM said at a gathering at the Statue of Unity in Kevadia on the birth anniversary of India's first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, commemorated as National Unity Day since Modi took office.Without naming the former Congress-led UPA government, Modi said people have still not forgotten those periods when they were apprehensive before going to crowded places. "There was a conspiracy to halt the country's progress by targeting festivals, markets, public places, and centres of economic activity."The PM accused the opponents of having conveniently neglected investigating terrorist activities. 
"People have seen the devastation wrecked by blasts and the lethargy of the then government in the name of investigation. This mentality of appeasement was so dangerous that it led them to save terrorists in courts. Such a mindset cannot benefit any community or country," he said, adding that people should not let the country relapse into a similar situation.Modi said in the last nine years, India's internal security faced numerous challenges from multiple fronts. "But unlike the past, the nefarious designs of the country's enemies were foiled due to the hard work of the security forces."Besides being aimed at the UPA era, which was marked by a relentless campaign by terrorists, Modi's remark appeared to be referring to the criticism of the government by Congress, Left and others in the opposition for abstaining from last week's vote in the UN General Assembly over a resolution that called for a pause in Israel's ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza.India skipped the vote since the resolution did not mention October 7 massacre of innocent civilians, elderly, women and babies by Hamas terrorists who also raped and abducted women and have been holding them as hostages to be used as "human shield".BJP attributed opposition's criticism to their subservience to "politics of vote bank" - BJP's short hand for "appeasement of Muslim hardliners".PM's remarks indicated the widening of a new faultline which opened up since the Israel-Hamas conflict. Opposition has accused the government of abdicating India's pro-Palestinian stance by not calling for a ceasefire, while BJP claime the opposition is scared of calling Hamas out for the brutality inflicted on Israelis for fear of annoying the "vote bank" , and referred to the absence of any mention of the Hamas' attack in the CWC resolution.Reps of erstwhile princely states felicitatedKesridevsinh Jhala, scion of Wankaner princely state and Rajya Sabha member, on Tuesday, said that the feat of Sardar Patel of integrating India from 562 princely states was also a tale of the sacrifice of the princely states. Jhala was speaking at the princely states’ felicitation event to mark the National Unity Day. The event in Ahmedabad saw felicitation of over 30 representatives of princely states from Gujarat and other parts in the presence of CM Bhupendra Patel, and former CMs Vijay Rupani and Shankersinh Vaghela.

Several staff members at the 92nd Street Y (92NY) in New York are resigning in the wake of the cultural hub's decision to abruptly cancel a scheduled reading by author Viet Thanh Nguyen, NPR reported. The cancellation has also placed the remainder of 92NY's poetry reading season, which was set to include appearances by prominent authors such as Emily Wilson, Roxane Gay, and Tracy K. Smith, "on pause," according to a spokesperson for 92NY.Viet Thanh Nguyen, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author known for works like "The Sympathizer," had been scheduled to appear at 92NY on Friday to promote his new memoir, "A Man of Two Faces." Earlier in the week, Nguyen had joined over 700 other writers in signing an open letter published in the London Review of Books, advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza.In response to the cancellation, a spokesperson for 92NY cited the organization's commitment to diverse viewpoints and stated, "As a Jewish organization, we believe the responsible course of action right now is to take some time to determine how best to use our platform and support the entire 92NY community, so we made the difficult decision to postpone the October 20th event."Rather than hosting the event at 92NY, Nguyen moved it to the McNally Jackson bookstore in Manhattan.Following the cancellation, the director of the poetry center, Sarah Chihaya, and the senior program coordinator, Sophie Herron, both resigned from their positions at 92NY.The 92nd Street Y's Unterberg Poetry Center has a storied history as a hub for literary events and readings, featuring renowned writers such as T.S. Eliot, Langston Hughes, Marianne Moore, and contemporary authors like Sandra Cisneros and Lorrie Moore.NPR reported that Viet Thanh Nguyen indicated that he had not been in direct communication with the board or any representatives from 92NY. 
On his Instagram account, he expressed, "I have no regrets about anything I have said or done in regards to Palestine, Israel, or the occupation and war." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'Moral cowardice': Jewish billionaire resigns from Columbia board over threats to Jews on campus

Henry Swieca, a Jewish billionaire and philanthropist, has resigned from the board of directors at Columbia University, citing the institution's failure to address what he perceives as a growing anti-Semitic sentiment on campus. Swieca, who is also an alumnus of the university, expressed his disappointment in a resignation letter that was made public, where he criticized the university for what he calls "moral cowardice" and for allowing an environment where Jewish and pro-Israel students feel threatened.Swieca's decision to step down is in response to a series of events that have unfolded on campus, including a violent attack on an Israeli student and numerous pro-Hamas demonstrations. The situation escalated following an attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, which led to a series of retaliatory strikes by Israel in Gaza. 
The unrest at Columbia has been marked by protests and confrontations, with over 100 professors at the university signing a letter in defense of pro-Palestinian students.In a letter dated October 30 and later shared on social media, Swieca expressed his dismay at what he calls the "moral cowardice" of the institution, which he feels has been compromised to the point of being "beyond repair." He was particularly disturbed by the university's response to pro-Hamas demonstrations on campus, which he described as "revolting," especially when such events included slogans calling for the destruction of Israel."To my deep regret, the reputation and integrity of Columbia University, and by extension Columbia Business School, have been significantly compromised by a moral cowardice that appears beyond repair," Swieca said in the letter.Quoting Abraham Lincoln, "To sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men," Swieca said the entire Columbia administration has failed to take a firm stance condemning Hamas."With blatantly anti-Jewish student groups and professors allowed to operate with complete impunity, it sends a clear and distressing message that Jews are not just unwelcome, but also unsafe on campus," the Jewish billionaire added.Swieca said that the tolerance shown towards anti-Jewish student groups and professors has sent a distressing message that Jewish members of the university community are not only unwelcome but also unsafe.The resignation letter concludes with Swieca's deep concern for the direction in which Columbia University is heading. His departure from the board was met with support from Shai Davidai, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, who commended Swieca as a "brave and honorable member" of the board.The university has recently established an antisemitism task force to address the issues, but critics argue that this measure is insufficient and belated. Swieca, who is 66 and the founder of Talpion Fund Management, emphasized in his letter dated October 30 that the presence of anti-Jewish groups and professors on campus sends a distressing message that Jews are not only unwelcome but also unsafe at Columbia.In response to the ongoing concerns, a spokesperson for Columbia University said that the safety and security of all students and community members are a top priority, which has led to the formation of the task force on antisemitism and a doxing resource group to tackle the problem of doxing.

NEW DELHI: The FBI director, Christopher Wray, issued a warning about the increasing number of terrorist threats against the United States. His biggest concern is the potential for individuals acting alone to carry out attacks inspired by how Hamas operates. Speaking at the International Association of Chiefs of Police annual conference in San Diego, Wray urged law enforcement to be more cautious regarding the potential repercussions of the ongoing Israeli-Hamas war. 
According to an FBI transcript, he said, "History has been witness to antisemitic and other forms of violent extremism for far too long. We remain committed to continuing confronting those threats"."In this heightened environment, there's no question we're seeing an increase in reported threats, and we've got to be on the lookout, especially for lone actors who may take inspiration from recent events to commit violence of their own," he added.Wray's warning followed a declaration by former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal, who designated October 13 as a "Day of Jihad."The FBI director refrained from disclosing any specific domestic threats originating directly from the conflict but instead issued a general warning. He also urged law enforcement officials to maintain their efforts in sharing intelligence and working together. Wray emphasized the importance of a two-way information exchange, stating, ""I'd also ask you to continue sharing any intelligence or observations you may have. On our end, we're committed to doing the same, so that together, we can safeguard our communities."The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 1,300 Israeli and 2,400 Palestinian deaths. The US State Department reports at least 29 American casualties and 15 are unaccounted for, including some who are believed to be held as hostages by Hamas. In response to the initial attack by Hamas at its border, Israel has launched extensive military strikes in the Gaza Strip. As part of its preparations for a potential ground invasion in the area, Israel has urged hundreds of thousands of residents in and around Gaza City to evacuate the region.Iran has issued a warning that it might intervene if Israel carries out a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. In response, US officials have attempted to discourage Tehran from interfering in the conflict, especially through its proxy groups like Hezbollah, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the US. The Biden administration has consistently expressed its strong support for Israel in its efforts to combat the terrorists responsible for attacking its citizens. US President Joe Biden stated last week that the United States will ensure that Israel has the necessary resources to protect its people, defend itself, and respond to these attacks. He emphasized that there can be no justification or excuse for terrorism. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on December 1 attend the World Climate Action Summit (WCAS) during the 28th session of the UN climate conference (COP28) in Dubai where he is expected to pitch for all the core issues, including tripling of renewable energy capacity globally by 2030, scaling up climate finance from billions to trillions of dollars and Mission LiFE (lifestyle for environment), that got traction at G20 leaders' summit here under India's presidency in September.Sources said that Modi would also visit India's pavilion which has been set up on the India’s G20 presidency's theme — 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam': One Earth,One Family, One Future -- at COP28 venue. The pavilion will showcase the country's efforts to instill a sense of unanimity for addressing the global challenge of climate change.The UAE under its presidency of COP28 will host three high-level events focused on the global stocktake (GST), covering mitigation, adaptation, and the means of implementation of various climate actions at the Summit which may give a political momentum to the annual climate conference at a time when the world is quite divided on the issue of Israel-Palestine war in Gaza.The COP28, scheduled to be held during November 30-December 12, will conclude the first ever GST -- analysis of voluntary climate actions taken by over 195 countries as per their commitments under the Paris Agreement -- and may also adopt the mechanism to operationalise ‘loss and damage’ funds. 
The fund is meant for supporting developing countries, primarily the least developed ones, impacted by climate change. Issue of curtailing fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) use will also figure prominently at the conference even as its immediate 'phase out' has not been on radar despite growing demands for it.Environment minister Bhupender Yadav is also expected to attend the COP28 and lead a team of India's negotiators during key parleys at its high-level segment.Besides Mission LiFE and enhancing the renewable energy capacity, the other issues which may find prominence in Modi's address at the Summit include matters concerning global biofuels alliance and substantially increasing climate finance flow to help global South. The Mission LiFE, launched jointly by Modi and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in October last year in Gujarat, is India-led global mass movement to nudge individual and community action to protect and preserve the environment. It promotes an environmentally conscious lifestyle that focuses on ‘mindful and deliberate utilisation’ of resources instead of its ‘mindless and wasteful consumption’.

On October 7, Palestinian militant groups led by Hamas, began a militant invasion of Israel from the Gaza Strip as part of the Gaza-Israel conflict. Israel has since launched a counter-offensive and the region has been under constant rain of warheads for five days, with a rising death toll. As part of the Israeli response, the country has mobilised its defence force and here are five military vehicles that the personnel have at their disposal. 
From the American made Humvee to the Israeli developed 'Wolf' armoured vehicle, these utility vehicles hold an important role in driving the country's counter offensive.1. AIL Storm:The AIL Storm is based on the well-known Jeep Wrangler 4x4, it has been licensed from Chrysler by Israel and manufactured as an off-road vehicle for the Israeli Security Forces. The AIL Storm has been under production since 1991 and serves several military roles including that of an armoured infantry mobility vehicle. Currently, 700 units of the AIL Storm are under service.2. MDT David:The MDT David is a light armoured vehicle developed by Israel, this one also looks familiar as it has been based on the well known Land Rover Defender 4x4. The armoured SUV has been built for the Israeli Security Forces by MDT Armor Corporation and is capable of defending against low intensity conflict from assault rifles, it is blast protected and can also protect against Improvised Explosive Devices (IMDs) to a certain extent. The Israeli defence forces currently have 400 of MDT David SUVs in their fleet.3. The HMMWV or Humvee:American-made High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) or more popularly known as the Humvee reinforces the Israeli defence as well. The country currently has 2,000 Humvees under service.4. Plasan SandCat:The Plasan SandCat is another light armoured vehicle developed for the Israel Defence Forces. Just like others on the list, the SandCat is also based on an American truck, more specifically the well known Ford F-Series chassis. It was first introduced in 2005 and has since evolved. IDF currently has 700 SandCats in its fleet and they serve in various roles of combat and patrolling.5. 'Wolf' armoured vehicle:Among the light armoured vehicles mentioned above, Israel also developed the 'Wolf' armoured personnel carrier for the IDF. It is heavily armoured and produced by Carmor company. It is capable of defending against assault rifles, mines and IMDs. The Wolf is based on the chassis of the Ford F550 truck and gets 6.0-litre V8 petrol engine, producing 325 hp. Currently there are 300 Wolf armoured vehicles under service in Israel.

50 years of Yom Kippur war: How US aided Israel's military victory

The Yom Kippur War, also known as the October War or the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, was a conflict that took place in October 1973, when Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israel during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur.The United States played a significant role in supporting Israel. The conflict underscored the U.S. Cold War perspective in the Middle East, as President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger viewed it primarily through a Cold War lens. An airlift of U.S. weapons aided Israel, helping them ultimately win, and Kissinger facilitated disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt, sidelining the Soviets. 
Here's a brief about the role played by US is supporting Israel:Military Resupply: The United States airlifted military supplies to Israel during the conflict. This support included ammunition, tanks, aircraft, and other vital equipment, which helped Israel replenish its dwindling resources on the battlefield.Diplomatic Support: The U.S. provided diplomatic support to Israel in international forums, including the United Nations, and worked to ensure that Israel's interests were defended.Financial Assistance: The U.S. granted financial aid to Israel to help cover the costs of the war and its aftermath. This aid was essential in helping Israel recover economically and rebuild its military.Intelligence Sharing: The U.S. shared intelligence information with Israel, helping them to anticipate enemy movements and make informed decisions on the battlefield.Strategic Cooperation: The U.S. and Israel had developed a strong strategic relationship over the years, which also played a role in supporting Israel during the war. Israel had received military hardware and training from the U.S. in the years leading up to the conflict.The U.S.'s longstanding support for Israel, while portraying it as a beleaguered state, has shaped its Middle East policy, but Israel has also built ties with China and Russia. The aftermath of the Yom Kippur War set a pattern of Israel prioritizing its interests in peace agreements, while the Palestinian issue remained unresolved, perpetuating tensions in the region.While U.S. support was significant in Yom Kippur war, it's essential to acknowledge that Israel's own military capabilities, quick mobilization of reserves, and the determination of its soldiers were key factors in its victory in the Yom Kippur War. Additionally, there were diplomatic efforts, including a ceasefire brokered by the United Nations, that contributed to ending the conflict. The Yom Kippur War was a complex and multifaceted conflict with many factors at play, and attributing Israel's success solely to U.S. assistance would oversimplify the situation.

After Biden, Rishi Sunak plans Israel visit amidst escalating conflict with Hamas: report

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to embark on a diplomatic mission to the Israel this week, as reported by Sky News. While Downing Street has not officially confirmed the visit, it is anticipated that Sunak will be making his way to the region following calls with world leaders concerning the Israel-Gaza conflict.The move comes amidst escalating tensions in the region, with concerns about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza mounting. The conflict began when Hamas launched a surprise assault on Israel on October 7, resulting in the deaths of at least 1,400 people and thousands more injured. 
In the subsequent days, Israel responded with retaliatory air strikes on Gaza, cutting off essential supplies, including fuel, water, food, and medical aid. The situation has been dire, especially for the over two million people living in the cramped territory.The international community has been closely monitoring the situation, with visits from world leaders such as Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden. President Biden is set to visit Israel and Jordan, meeting with regional leaders to address the ongoing conflict and prevent it from spiraling into a wider regional issue.While details of Sunak's itinerary are yet to be officially confirmed, it is reported that his discussions will focus on efforts to de-escalate the crisis and prevent further bloodshed in the region. Sunak has been in touch with leaders from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, emphasizing the importance of finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Furthermore, discussions are underway to secure the release of hostages and ensure the safe passage of humanitarian aid to alleviate the humanitarian suffering in Gaza.The British Prime Minister's support for Israel's right to defend itself against attacks by Hamas is balanced with a call for the protection of civilians. The death toll in Gaza has continued to rise, with the conflict taking an increasingly devastating toll on Palestinian civilians.In addition to calls for de-escalation and humanitarian support, there are unconfirmed reports that Prime Minister Sunak may extend his visit to include stops in Jordan and Egypt. The international community is closely watching these developments, hopeful that diplomatic efforts will lead to a more stable and peaceful situation in the region.Meanwhile, the tragic news emerged that one of the two British sisters who went missing during the Hamas attack, Yahel Sharabi, aged 13, has been killed, highlighting the human toll of this conflict. Prime Minister Sunak has vowed to support the protection of British nationals and take steps to assist those affected by the violence, both in the region and at home.

Government must focus on reforms to lower cost of doing business: Ex-CEA

MARRAKECH: India's executive director to the International Monetary Fund Krishnamurthy Subramanian has said that the government needs to focus on pushing forward with land, labour, logistics and other reforms to lower the cost of doing business, while suggesting that state governments must be disincentivised from providing freebies."While people will not be averse to freebies, today's aspirational youth wants economic development and empowerment. What's happening in Karnataka suggests that things are not looking great from the perspective of capital investment. The example of Gujarat is something all states can learn from. 
Uttar Pradesh is also showing good progress. On the economic and political side, you need to make people understand that freebies will not be good for them in the long run and disincentivise freebies," the former chief economic adviser told TOI.He said some of the steps announced during Covid, such as new labour codes, also need to be pursued, as he expected the Indian economy to maintain its growth momentum, driven by domestic demand."Last year, even the 7% projection was revised to 7.2% and when the final revisions come, growth is likely to be closer to 7.5%. The reason why growth rates are getting revised upwards is because our consumption and IIP data are older and not reflecting some of the positive trends... Given the reforms that have been implemented, India will grow at high rates... The impact of many of the reforms that have been done during Covid and beyond, will be felt with lag," Subramanian said, adding that the Indian economy is expected to expand around 6.5% during the current fiscal year.While there are concerns over the impact of the conflict in West Asia, the economist said that it is early to predict. "Unlike the Ukraine war where Russia and Ukraine were big suppliers of crude oil, wheat and sunflower oil, in the situation in West Asia right now, neither Palestine or Israel are exporters of basic things like crude oil or food. So supply side impact will be moderate," he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

ROURKELA: Arpita Panda is familiar with drills necessary to escape a missile attack, but the PhD student from Odisha, who is doing research in biochemistry at Ariel University in West Bank, does not know where to hide if there is a terrorist attack. Even though she is far away from the Gaza Strip, that is being bombarded by Israel, and from the sensitive southern and northern border areas of Israel, Arpita is worried. She is among 30 students from Odisha who are stuck in Israel and the West Bank amid Israel's war with Hamas. 
Students who TOI spoke to said they are very scared even as Indian embassies in Israel and Palestine have advised them to stay indoors."When the war started, I became very afraid. I don't know how to deal with terrorist infiltration," said Arpita who lives in an apartment on the university campus. "My parents and relatives were panicking at home. But the Israeli government and university are prompt about updates on the war. They gave us detailed guidelines, did an online drill and provided a psychologist to talk to us and keep us calm," said Arpita. "Right now, our area is peaceful but we have heard how students near the border areas have been rushing to bunkers amid blaring of sirens," she said. Arpita said essential supplies have not been hit. "The Indian embassy is in touch with us. We have been told to stock up food. I have seven days' ration. Right now, we have continuous water and electricity power," she said. Arpita is pinning her hopes on the Indian government rescuing its citizens. Back home in Bhubaneswar, Arpita's father has very little to do but pray. "There is calm in West Bank but still we are very much in panic," said Ratnakar Panda. "We are praying that she comes home at the earliest."In Jerusalem, life had been smooth for Puri's Satyaranjan Biswal, a fourth year PhD scholar at Hebrew University. But the surprise dawn attack by Hamas on Israel has turned his plans upside down. Biswal said the war and bloodshed have hit him psychologically. "Suddenly, my life has become uncertain. Around 30 Odia students and numerous Indians are living in fear," he said. Biswal said Jerusalem may have a semblance of stability but still there is a war. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

CHENNAI: Vijayakumar, 64, and his wife Usha Devi, 59, are in a rare mix of relief and tension. Relief because they are with their daughter; tension because they find themselves in a war zone. The couple from Thiruvananthapuram had travelled to Israel last month to spend time with their daughter Anagha, who is pursuing her PhD at Bar Ilan University, Tel Aviv and are now stuck in raging war after Palestinian militant groups unleashed aerial attacks on Israel on Saturday.Their neighbourhood was relatively peaceful, and Vijayakumar, who has high blood pressure and a prostate problem, stepped out with his wife and Anagha's classmate Manoj Shanmugasundaram on Monday to buy medicines. 
"We were at a bus stop when sirens went off," Vijayakumar told TOI over phone from a bomb shelter in Tel Aviv. They ran into an apartment complex, but the gates were closed. "There was nobody there and we waited in the corridor for a while before going back to the University where we were living with our daughter," said Usha. "The university gates were also closed, and the security personnel had moved into the bomb shelter. We called the security and waited outside. We could hear explosions. Those were some tense moments."The couple were supposed to return to India on Sunday. Since Air India cancelled its flights, they got stuck in Israel. "Here the roads are empty. We have seen such attacks on television, this is the first time we are seeing it in real life. Our daughter is breaking down thinking about our safety," said Usha Rani.Vijayakumar said he is in dire need of medicines. "Unlike in India, here it's difficult to get medicines. When I called the Indian embassy here, the response was poor as they themselves are in bunkers. It would be great if some Indian association in Israel gets me medicines," said Vijayakumar. Manoj Shanmugasundaram, who shares the shelter space with Anagha's family, said the neighbourhood was silent till Sunday, the attacks started on Monday. "We were all shaken by what has been happening since then," he said.Eswaran Lakshmanan from Palani in Tamil Nadu, who is doing his post-doctoral fellowship in a university in Kiryat Ono in Tel Aviv, told TOI how he saw missiles from their balcony. "I have been here for the past four years. In 2021, there was a similar situation. But it came under control in a week. Now I am in a bomb shelter," he said. "We felt vibrations of explosions. Our Israeli professors call us and check about our condition regularly. My parents want me to return, but I am just assessing the situation," he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Son of Hamas founder appeals to US for aid in easing Gaza crisis

The son of a prominent Hamas founder has appealed to the U.S. government to exert diplomatic pressure on Egypt to open its borders, allowing the people of Gaza to escape the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, reported Fox News.Mosab Hassan Yousef, who had previously been incarcerated in an Israeli prison and later sought refuge in the United States, emphasized the urgent need for Egypt to provide a safe route for Gaza's civilians during an appearance on "FOX & Friends."Yousef stated on Tuesday, "We must find a way to pressure the Egyptian government to facilitate the departure of Gazans. Whether they leave permanently or temporarily, we don't need Gaza anymore. It has become a refugee camp that was supposed to have been dismantled 70 years ago, but hope was sustained by the United Nations and Arab nations."He continued, "This is the root of our current crisis. We have a war, and civilians are caught in the wrong place. 
Instead of the United Nations blaming everyone and declaring a humanitarian crisis, they should allow civilians to evacuate. Egypt must open its borders."Yousef, who had worked as a spy for Israel's Mossad after defecting from Hamas, argued that the United States could influence Egypt due to the military aid it provides to the country. He explained that allowing civilians to leave the Gaza Strip would enable Israel to effectively counter and eliminate Hamas."The United States must exert significant pressure on the Egyptian government to open the border," he urged. "The United States allocates almost $1.3 billion in military aid to Egypt each year from taxpayer money. They have the capacity to apply pressure. Israel cannot pressure Egypt, but I believe the United States can. Let all Palestinians in the Gaza Strip evacuate immediately so that Israel can address the situation appropriately and eliminate this ruthless organization."President Biden had pledged support for Israel amid growing calls for a ceasefire, requesting billions of dollars in aid from Congress for both Israel and Gaza's civilians as they grapple with a deepening humanitarian crisis in the Hamas-controlled area.Biden announced during his trip to Israel, "I will request an unparalleled support package for Israel's defense from the United States Congress. We will ensure that the Iron Dome remains fully supplied to safeguard Israeli skies and save lives. We will also deploy U.S. military assets to the region, including positioning the USS Ford carrier strike group in the eastern Mediterranean, with the USS Eisenhower en route, to deter further Israeli aggression and prevent the escalation of this conflict."He added, "I'm here to assure you that the terrorists will not prevail. Freedom will prevail. So let me conclude where I began: Israel, you are not alone. The United States stands with you."The funding proposal encompasses $61.4 billion for Ukraine, $14.3 billion for Israel (with $10.6 billion earmarked for military assistance), $13.6 billion for border security (including measures to combat the flow of fentanyl), and substantial investments in Indo-Pacific security assistance, totaling around $7.4 billion. Additionally, there is $9 billion designated for humanitarian aid in Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza.Israel's funding will be directed towards strengthening its air and missile defense systems, including the Iron Dome, and the development of the Iron Beam, a high-energy laser weapon used in air defense.When Lawrence Jones asked Yousef if Israel could succeed without assistance from the United States, he responded, "Certainly not. Whether we like it or not, the United States is a part of this conflict because if we don't show strength, we could be next in line. In fact, Hamas, Iran, and Russia are targeting the United States through Israel. So we all recognize this issue."He further elaborated, "In fact, I would like to see a stronger U.S. presence, not necessarily military action. There is a significant difference between being present and being prepared. If you dare to launch a missile from Iran or Hezbollah, we will respond decisively. This deterrent is not about engaging in conflict; it's about preventing a regional war and even a global conflict." For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Why India took a side in the Israel-Hamas war

PM Narendra Modi was briefed by his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on the ongoing situation as his country carries out retaliatory strikes against Hamas. India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, Modi said on Tuesday. War continuesIsraeli warplanes have pounded the Gaza Strip after its Hamas militant rulers launched an unprecedented weekend attack on Israel.So far, at least 700 are dead and thousands wounded in Gaza, according to health officials cited by news agencies - a punishing response to the militant group's attack that has killed over 900 Israelis. 
More than 150 Israeli civilians and soldiers have been taken captive.A 'bond'Israel's Consulate General to Mumbai Kobbi Shoshani has said that when leaders like PM Modi support Israel, it gives the country a lot of power. He stressed on the "strong bond, friendship and support" Israel receives from India and underscored the continuous fight against terrorism as he expressed Israel's commitment to assist foreigners and Indians in leaving the region safely if needed.Israel's ambassador to India Naor Gilon had said on Saturday that India's support is significant to Israel for two reasons. First, India's importance in global politics. Second, India's own long fight against terrorism.To be sure, India so far has refrained from condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and resisted all pressures from the West on the matter.A change in policyModi's support for Israel in the ongoing war is a major deviation from a decades old cautious diplomatic policy concerning the Middle East. India did not take Israel's side in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, 1956 Suez crisis, the Six-Day war with Palestine in 1967, the 1973 Yom Kippur War and the 2006 Lebanon war.After 2014, India-Israel relationship seems to have begun taking a friendly turn. In 2015 and 2016, India abstained from a UN vote on whether Israel should be brought before the International Criminal Court for its alleged war crimes during the 2014 Gaza crisis. In 2017, Modi became the first Indian PM to ever visit Israel.WhyCurrently, India-Israel relations cover a broad spectrum ranging from defence to tourism.Some political observers also highlight similarities in political ideologies of the ruling BJP in India with Netanyahu's right-wing Likud and its alliance with ultranationalist groups as a bonding factor.

Israel President reveals 'Warrior's Guide: Jihadi Version' booklet 'recovered' from Hamas terrorist

NEW DELHI: Israel President Isaac Herzog revealed a booklet which he claimed was found on the body of a Hamas terrorist and contained detailed tactics on how to carry out the kidnapping.In an interview with CNN, the Israeli President showed the booklet titled -- "The Warrior's Guide: Jihadi Version"."This booklet is an operating manual, how to enter citizens' yards, kibbutz, city, moshav, how to break in there. And first - and what do you do when you find the citizens? You torture them. 
This is the booklet that says exactly how to torture them, how to kidnap them," Herzog told CNN.In an eight-page instructional guide, kidnappers are advised to employ captives as human shields in the event of an attack, without regard to their religion, race, or gender. The guide suggests that hostages should be eliminated when deemed necessary, particularly if there are signs of resistance among them. Terrorists are also encouraged to document their actions in real time.Notably, many terrorists equipped themselves with GoPro cameras to record their activities on the October 7 attack.The manual also outlines various tactics to establish control over captured territory, including suicide bombings, car bombings, ambushes, and sniper attacks. It provides instructions for seizing the identification documents of captives and recording their personal information.Additionally, the manual includes a detailed chart illustrating the hierarchical structure of the Israel Defense Force (IDF), along with comprehensive information about their armaments and electronic assets."It's simply an ideology from ISIS that calls for Israel to be wiped off the face of the earth, and therefore Hamas must be wiped off the face of the earth," Herzog said."The story is not Israel versus the Palestinians or Judaism versus Islam. The story is about where humanity should stand, are we with the good or the evil. The campaign we are waging now, as a nation rising like a lion, is against evil, and we will uproot evil so that it will be better for the whole region and the world," he added.Meanwhile, the Israeli military raised the figure to 199 people confirmed to have been abducted by Hamas to the Gaza Strip in the militants' cross-border attacks which sparked a devastating war.Israel declared war on the Islamist group a day after waves of its fighters broke through the heavily fortified border on October 7, shooting, stabbing and burning to death more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.Israel then unleashed a relentless bombing campaign on Gaza that has flattened neighbourhoods and left at least 2,670 people dead in the territory, mainly civilians.

Israel-Hamas: PM Modi condemns civilian deaths, asks Global South to band together

PM Narendra Modi strongly condemned civilian deaths in the Israel-Hamas conflict, while recalling India’s denunciation of the October 7 Hamas terror attacks, as he said the conflict in West Asia had given rise to new challenges and underscored India’s emphasis on restraint, dialogue and diplomacy.Addressing the second Voice of Global South Summit, Modi urged the developing countries to speak in one voice for greater global good.Modi’s remarks on the conflict, in a virtual summit of the leaders of the developing world, are another balancing act by India at a time many of them remain worried about Israel’s actions in Gaza, which were triggered by the Hamas terrorist strikes, and the reluctance of the West to enforce a ceasefire. The Global South had last month voted mostly in favour of the UN General Assembly resolution that sought, among other things, a "humanitarian truce’’.Citing G20 outcomes under its presidency, like inclusion of the African Union, consensus on multilateral development banks reforms and sustainable finance for developing countries, the PM said it was important to work for One Earth, One Family and One Future – the theme of India’s presidency – on the basis of 5 Cs – consultation, cooperation, communication, creativity and capacity building."Sabka Saath and Sabka Vikas are important for global prosperity. But we are seeing that developments in West Asia are giving rise to new challenges," said Modi, in his opening remarks in the heads of state/ government session. 
"India had condemned the horrific October 7 terror attacks. We have emphasised on restraint and also dialogue and diplomacy. We strongly condemn the deaths of civilians in the Israel-Hamas conflict," added Modi, as he recalled his conversation with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and India’s humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza.Unlike many Global South countries, India had abstained from voting on the truce resolution in the General Assembly because it didn't condemn the Hamas attacks. It has sought to balance out though by repeatedly calling for adherence to international humanitarian law, expressing concern over mounting civilian casualties, sending humanitarian aid to Gaza and by reiterating its support to negotiations for a 2-state solution.The PM also said that Voice of Global South was the most unique platform in the changing world. "Global South has always existed geographically but it’s only now that it is getting a voice too. This has been possible because of our joint efforts. We are more than a 100 different countries but we have the same interests and priorities," said Modi. "I cannot forget that historic moment, when the African Union (AU) was inducted into G20 as a permanent member with India's efforts," he added. The inclusion of AU in G20 was described by foreign minister S Jaishankar, in his remarks in the foreign ministers’ session, as perhaps the most satisfying outcome of India’s presidency. The PM also called for using new technology responsibly and in a manner that it doesn’t increase the divide between the North and the South. "After taking over the G20 presidency last year, we felt the need to take responsibility for lending a voice to Global South countries. Our priority was to turn G20 into a more inclusive and human-centric organisation. Our focus was development of the people, for the people and by the people. This is also why we hosted the first Global South summit in January this year. It helped us achieve consensus on issues related to the Global South in the New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration," said Modi.

Three law students from Harvard and Columbia universities have lost their job offers from a leading US law firm, Davis Polk, after they signed statements about the Hamas-Israel conflict that the firm disagreed with.The email announcing the decision, signed by Neil Barr, said that the student statements were "simply contrary to our firm's values". According to an NBC report, Joseph Gerstel, a small-business lawyer, shared a screenshot of the email on LinkedIn on Tuesday."The views expressed in certain of the statements signed by law school student organizations in recent days are in direct contravention of our firm's value system. For this reason and to ensure we continue to maintain a supportive and inclusive work environment, the student leaders responsible for signing on to these statements are no longer welcome in our firm; and their offers of employment have thus been rescinded," the firm letter said.The email did not name the students or the statements they signed.As per a report in the Insider, a New York University law student also lost a job offer from Winston & Strawn, a leading law firm, over the statement on the Israel-Hamas conflict. The statement, which was sent to the NYU Student Bar Association, said that Israel was "entirely responsible" for the "massive death toll."The students are not the only ones who are facing backlash for their views on the war. 
Some tech leaders withdrew from a major industry event in Europe after the summit's CEO denounced Israel.Last week, several public statements emerged from university groups supporting Palestinians and blaming Israel for the recent Israel-Hamas conflict, which started after a surprise Hamas attack on Israel killed over 1,300 people. These statements have caused uproar on college campuses and in corporate America.On October 10, The Harvard Crimson, a student-run news outlet at the university, reported that more than 30 Harvard student groups signed a letter that said Israel was "entirely responsible" for "all unfolding violence" in the conflict.Since then, many CEOs, business leaders and a federal judge have reacted by severing ties with the university, demanding to know who signed the letter or saying they would not employ them.Some prominent donors have also ended their relationship with Harvard over the letter, including the Wexner Foundation - co-founded by Leslie Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret.

AGARTALA: Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Kongkal Sangma urged the indigenous communities of Northeast India to join hands leaving aside all differences to ensure a constitutional solution for the tribals of the region while addressing a mammoth rally at Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (ADC) headquarter Khumlung organized by principal opposition party of the state TIPRA Motha on Saturday.Sangma along with a group of MLAs from Meghalaya has joined the rally to express solidarity and extend support to the fight for greater Tipraland and constitutional solution for the indigenous communities of the state, have been persuaded by Motha and its key leader Tripura royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarman."Despite minor differences among the tribal communities of Northeast, our identity is similar to the rest of the country. Although we are identified as a Northeastern community by Delhi, our issues are not dealt with together. As a result, indigenous people of the region have been facing multiple problems and the time has come to become united and raise voice for our rights," Sangma said.Appreciating the 'Thansa" (unity) move of Pradyot Kishore Debbarman, he said efforts have been made to unite all the indigenous people and communities of eight states of the region beyond narrow political interest and power game to spread the voice loudly for the development and ensuring the rights of the people of Northeast and added, "We shall move together to Delhi for our people."Addressing the gathering Pradyot expressed dissatisfaction towards media for not ventilating the issues and challenges of the indigenous communities of Northeast properly rather than giving more space to fight in Israel, Palestine, Pakistan, and the small issues of the so-called mainland. 
He alleged that not only the politicians but the people of Northeast have been marginalized by all other institutions and as a result, the sufferings of the people remain.The atrocities and crisis of Manipur are not reflected in the media properly, Pradyot alleged.He, however, criticized a section of tribal leaders saying that some leaders keep on changing the parties when not get tickets, or sell to other big parties for money, post, or position forgetting the commitment to their people."This time if anybody switches over compromising the interest of the communities, Tiprasa (tribal) will burn down their houses and property," Pradyot threatened adding that power is temporary but rights are permanent for the future. The leaders must remember they are free to choose the party but not compromise beyond the community interest; otherwise, the next generations of tribal will be marginalized and betrayed, he warned and added, "We are poor but not badgers." ADC administration is under TIPRA Motha's rule but frequently Chief Executive Member begs money from the state government. The people are dying 30 -km away from Agartala due to lack of treatment. We shall not allow this to continue anymore," Pradyot stated. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Biden says Hamas terror attack was aimed at thwarting India-Middle East-Europe economic corridor

WASHINGTON: Hamas launched a terror attack on Israel to torpedo the India-Middle East- Europe economic corridor formalised recently at the G20 summit, US President Joe Biden suggested on Wednesday, amid calls for New Delhi to designate Hamas a terrorist group. “I'm convinced one of the reasons Hamas attacked when they did, and I have no proof of this, just my instinct tells me, is because of the progress we were making towards regional integration for Israel, and regional integration overall. We can't leave that work behind,” Biden said at a White House joint press conference with visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. 
The ambitious multi-country corridor, which envisages linking India with Europe via UAE, Saudi Arabia and Israel through a rail network, is not only seen as a counter to China's Belt and Road Initiative, but also draws Middle-East antagonists into an economic clinch to the benefit of all. Several experts have surmised that Islamic extremist groups, backed notably by Iran, want to disrupt this in order to preserve unity among the so-called Muslim ummah. UAE and Saudi Arabia have moved in recent years to improve, in not normalize ties with Israel, ending decades of its isolation in the Islamic world.This is the second time in less than a week that Biden has mentioned the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) as a possible reason for the terrorist attack by Hamas. He doubled down on the theory on Wednesday even as he walked a fine line between muscular support for Israel and backing a two-state solution that will give Palestinians an independent state. The position puts New Delhi and Washington on the same page. "Israel has the right and, I would add, responsibility to respond to the slaughter of their people. And we will ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself against these terrorists. That’s a guarantee," Biden said, adding that this "does not lessen the need for (Israel) to operate and align with the laws of war." "It also means that when this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next. And in our view, it has to be a two-state solution," Biden said. Biden's remarks came even as Russia and China on one side and US on the other vetoed each others resolutions in the UN Security Council on the crisis. Key differences in the text included a specific mention in the US-backed proposal of States’ inherent right to self defence, and a call in the Russian-led one for the immediate cancellation by Israeli forces of the evacuation order for civilians to head into southern Gaza.Israel also renewed pressure on India to designate Hamas as a terrorist body. "I think that it's time to officially designate Hamas as a terror organisation in India. Most of the democracies, the EU, US, Canada, and Australia, I believe have already done this," Israel's ambassador to India Naor Gilon said in New Delhi, adding, "India is also a very important moral voice in the world and when it comes to terror, India... knows what they're talking about being victims for so many years of terrorism."

CHENNAI: Vijayakumar, 64, and his wife Usha Devi, 59, are in a rare mix of relief and tension. Relief because they are with their daughter; tension because they find themselves in a war zone. The couple from Thiruvananthapuram had travelled to Israel last month to spend time with their daughter Anagha, who is pursuing her PhD at Bar Ilan University, Tel Aviv and are now stuck in raging war after Palestinian militant groups unleashed aerial attacks on Israel on Saturday.Their neighbourhood was relatively peaceful, and Vijayakumar, who has high blood pressure and a prostate problem, stepped out with his wife and Anagha's classmate Manoj Shanmugasundaram on Monday to buy medicines. 
"We were at a bus stop when sirens went off," Vijayakumar told TOI over phone from a bomb shelter in Tel Aviv. They ran into an apartment complex, but the gates were closed. "There was nobody there and we waited in the corridor for a while before going back to the University where we were living with our daughter," said Usha. "The university gates were also closed, and the security personnel had moved into the bomb shelter. We called the security and waited outside. We could hear explosions. Those were some tense moments."The couple were supposed to return to India on Sunday. Since Air India cancelled its flights, they got stuck in Israel. "Here the roads are empty. We have seen such attacks on television, this is the first time we are seeing it in real life. Our daughter is breaking down thinking about our safety," said Usha Rani.Vijayakumar said he is in dire need of medicines. "Unlike in India, here it's difficult to get medicines. When I called the Indian embassy here, the response was poor as they themselves are in bunkers. It would be great if some Indian association in Israel gets me medicines," said Vijayakumar. Manoj Shanmugasundaram, who shares the shelter space with Anagha's family, said the neighbourhood was silent till Sunday, the attacks started on Monday. "We were all shaken by what has been happening since then," he said.Eswaran Lakshmanan from Palani in Tamil Nadu, who is doing his post-doctoral fellowship in a university in Kiryat Ono in Tel Aviv, told TOI how he saw missiles from their balcony. "I have been here for the past four years. In 2021, there was a similar situation. But it came under control in a week. Now I am in a bomb shelter," he said. "We felt vibrations of explosions. Our Israeli professors call us and check about our condition regularly. My parents want me to return, but I am just assessing the situation," he said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'Moral cowardice': Jewish billionaire resigns from Columbia board over threats to Jews on campus

Henry Swieca, a Jewish billionaire and philanthropist, has resigned from the board of directors at Columbia University, citing the institution's failure to address what he perceives as a growing anti-Semitic sentiment on campus. Swieca, who is also an alumnus of the university, expressed his disappointment in a resignation letter that was made public, where he criticized the university for what he calls "moral cowardice" and for allowing an environment where Jewish and pro-Israel students feel threatened.Swieca's decision to step down is in response to a series of events that have unfolded on campus, including a violent attack on an Israeli student and numerous pro-Hamas demonstrations. The situation escalated following an attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, which led to a series of retaliatory strikes by Israel in Gaza. 
The unrest at Columbia has been marked by protests and confrontations, with over 100 professors at the university signing a letter in defense of pro-Palestinian students.In a letter dated October 30 and later shared on social media, Swieca expressed his dismay at what he calls the "moral cowardice" of the institution, which he feels has been compromised to the point of being "beyond repair." He was particularly disturbed by the university's response to pro-Hamas demonstrations on campus, which he described as "revolting," especially when such events included slogans calling for the destruction of Israel."To my deep regret, the reputation and integrity of Columbia University, and by extension Columbia Business School, have been significantly compromised by a moral cowardice that appears beyond repair," Swieca said in the letter.Quoting Abraham Lincoln, "To sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men," Swieca said the entire Columbia administration has failed to take a firm stance condemning Hamas."With blatantly anti-Jewish student groups and professors allowed to operate with complete impunity, it sends a clear and distressing message that Jews are not just unwelcome, but also unsafe on campus," the Jewish billionaire added.Swieca said that the tolerance shown towards anti-Jewish student groups and professors has sent a distressing message that Jewish members of the university community are not only unwelcome but also unsafe.The resignation letter concludes with Swieca's deep concern for the direction in which Columbia University is heading. His departure from the board was met with support from Shai Davidai, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School, who commended Swieca as a "brave and honorable member" of the board.The university has recently established an antisemitism task force to address the issues, but critics argue that this measure is insufficient and belated. Swieca, who is 66 and the founder of Talpion Fund Management, emphasized in his letter dated October 30 that the presence of anti-Jewish groups and professors on campus sends a distressing message that Jews are not only unwelcome but also unsafe at Columbia.In response to the ongoing concerns, a spokesperson for Columbia University said that the safety and security of all students and community members are a top priority, which has led to the formation of the task force on antisemitism and a doxing resource group to tackle the problem of doxing.

Jordanian man's shocking plot to attack Jewish gathering in Houston unveiled

A Jordanian man was taken into custody in Houston last month on charges related to federal firearm possession, with alarming revelations emerging during the legal proceedings. A federal judge disclosed that the individual, Sohaib Abuayyash, had discussed "martyrdom" and was reportedly involved in a plot to target a Jewish gathering, according to a law enforcement source cited by CNN.Sohaib Abuayyash, aged 20, is currently in the United States on an expired nonimmigrant visa, and disturbing statements he made prompted concerns about his intentions. The federal court judge ordered his detention pending trial, citing that Abuayyash had "expressed support for harming individuals of specific religious beliefs" and had made reference to an undisclosed event within the Houston area associated with a particular religious group. 
However, specific details regarding the intended target, time, or location of the gathering remained unclear in court documents.The arrest occurs against the backdrop of heightened tensions and protests surrounding the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. The head of the FBI has expressed concerns about rising antisemitism levels in the United States, characterizing them as "historic."The investigation into Abuayyash began in August, prompted by law enforcement agents conducting "open-source research" that revealed videos of him firing multiple firearms, including AR-style rifles, on social media platforms. These findings led to a redacted probable cause affidavit filed on October 19 in the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas.As per the affidavit, Abuayyash had sought asylum in the US after his nonimmigrant visa expired in 2019. He was authorized to work in the country until August 2025 but was explicitly prohibited from possessing or using firearms and ammunition. The affidavit further noted that Abuayyash had been in contact with like-minded individuals, undergone physical training, and received weapons training in preparation for a potential attack.Although the affidavit did not provide extensive details about the investigation, US Magistrate Judge Christina A. Bryan's order of detention pending trial emphasized that Abuayyash had accessed specific and detailed content from radical organizations on the internet, which included instructions on constructing bombs and explosive devices. The judge also mentioned that Abuayyash had made statements supportive of violence against individuals of specific religious faiths, referencing a potential event in Houston involving a particular religious group.Given Abuayyash's active involvement in firearm training and his alleged plans to attack a Jewish gathering in Houston, the FBI decided to press the immediate charge of illegal firearm possession by a prohibited person. This allowed them to detain Abuayyash and pursue further investigations with the possibility of additional charges at a later date.In a statement to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, FBI Director Christopher Wray emphasized the elevated terrorism threat in 2023, particularly linked to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Wray expressed concerns about the potential for attacks against Americans within the United States, both by homegrown violent extremists inspired by foreign terrorist organizations and domestic extremists targeting Jewish or Muslim communities. He specifically cited the recent arrest of an individual in Houston who had demonstrated interest in bomb-making and voiced support for violence against Jewish communities. Christina Garza, a spokesperson for the FBI's Houston field office, confirmed Abuayyash as the individual referred to by the director in his statement. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israel-Hamas war: Son of Hamas founder warns that his father seeks to 'annihilate' the Jews' and establish Sharia law

NEW DELHI: Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of Hamas founder Sheikh Hassan Yousef, defected from the terrorist group and served as an Israeli spy for a long period of time. He has voiced concerns about his father's intentions and Hamas's goal to 'annihilate' Jewish people and establish sharia law worldwide, as per The Daily Mail. Yousef's father, Sheikh Hassan Yousef, was one of 60 Hamas leaders who were arrested last week in a raid in the West Bank.Known as 'Green Prince', Yousef served as an Israeli spy from 1997 to 2007. He provided valuable intelligence that helped prevent suicide bomb attacks and terrorist acts.In a series of interviews with some of the American media outlets, Yousef cautioned that his father and Hamas are not solely focused on acquiring territorial Palestine but are rather focused on an unending religious war.He said, "they are a religious movement, this is what everybody is afraid to say. If Hamas was a political movement, we could satisfy their political ambition. 
But Hamas is a religious movement that does not believe in political borders - they want to establish an Islamic state on the rubble of the state of Israel".He further revealed that their goal is to eradicate the Jewish people and the state of Israel. They want to kill anyone who supports Israel's existence, and subsequently establish an Islamic State.'But this is not the end because their ambition is global. They want to eventually establish an Islamic State, a global Islamic State,' he told CNN. He additionally mentioned that the group starts war with Israel whenever they need financial aid.Yousef also stated, "This war, Israel did not start. Hamas started this war. Hamas, blood for money, they start a war every few years when they want money they shed children's blood and this has to stop. This has to stop. It has to come to an end. Unfortunately the price is not going to be cheap"."I feel very sorry for Israel that they have to go into Gaza where there are booby traps all over the place...I don't know how many Israeli soldiers have to die in order to destroy Hamas," he added.Yousef appeared on Fox News as well where he asserted that Hamas is  'more dangerous' than ISIS. He said, "Look at the division and the global confusion because of Hamas. They brought us to our knees somehow by their brutality and their barbarism. Brutality is even understating Hamas' acts"."Hamas is a religious movement, and they are a raging religious movement against Israel. The mainstream media cannot say this because they are afraid to ignite a religious war," he added.Yousef continued to say, "And what I say, it already is. They want to annihilate the Jewish people because they are Jewish people, because they are a Jewish state.""We need to expose them for what they are - they are not a national movement. When they are a religious movement, they don't believe in political borders, are driven by dark hatred toward a race, towards a nation."Yousef asserted that Israel needs to take out Hamas' leadership along with overthrowing the terror group in Gaza. "They need to deal with the head of the snake in Doha, Beirut - wherever they are, cut the head of the snake and let the tail die. We can overthrow them," he added, For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

'Never seen anything worse': Brutal onslaught by Hamas leaves Israeli community shattered

NEW DELHI: Brutality unfolded in Kfar Aza as over 100 civilians lost their lives in the attack and death toll across the south of Israel surpassed 1,000 amidst 'surprise attack' by Hamas. According to the Times of Israel, grim scenes of burned homes, mutilated bodies and disregard for human life could be witnessed all around Kfar Aza.The assailants, according to Israeli army officer Omar Barak, ruthlessly stormed the Kibbutz, setting homes ablaze to force occupants out. Many of the citizens, as Barak noted, chose to succumb to the flames rather than fall victim to the Hamas terrorists.Hamas attackers had not only slaughtered civilians but in some cases decapitated the victims. 
The community, located just two kilometers from Gaza, had to bear the brunt of a ruthless onslaught by Hamas terrorists who crossed the border.Efforts by Israel Defence Force to reclaim control of Kfar Aza were marked by intense battles that lasted for two harrowing days. Expressing the emotional toll of witnessing the aftermath, Barak, said,"I had never seen anything worse. I broke down when I saw the bodies of two children assassinated,"Retired Israeli major general Itai Veruv echoed the sentiments, describing the scene as a "big massacre, a big disaster." Residents, although familiar with tensions and violence involving Palestinians, had chosen to live in proximity to the Gaza Strip. Some of the residents were driven by a commitment to maintain an Israeli presence near the enclave, even after the 2005 withdrawal of Israeli troops.Israeli forces faced approximately 70 well-equipped and skilled attackers, fighting wave after wave to reclaim control in Kfar Aza. Reflecting on his experience, Veruv remarked, "In 40 years of service I saw many difficult things, but never something like this."The kibbutz, home to about 400 people, witnessed the loss of more than 100 civilians with some estimates reaching 150. Over 5,000 rockets have been launched by Hamas, causing further deaths and injuries in southern and central areas. The conflict has escalated, with the death toll in Israel reaching 1,000 by Tuesday and over 500 people remaining hospitalized with life-threatening injuries. Gaza reported over 700 deaths in retaliatory Israeli strikes.The Israeli government has vowed to ensure that Hamas never poses a threat again with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likening the atrocities against Israeli civilians to the actions of ISIS.

Israeli Shekel at almost 8-year low: Bank of Israel to sell $30 bn of forex to stabilise shekel amidst war

Israeli Shekel in free fall! The Bank of Israel has announced its intention to sell up to $30 billion of foreign currency in the open market. This move marks the central bank's first-ever foreign exchange sale and is aimed at maintaining stability during the ongoing conflict with Palestinian militants in Gaza, according to a Reuters report.Following this announcement, the Israeli shekel experienced a significant decline of 2.7% against the US dollar, reaching a rate of 3.945. This level represents its lowest value since early 2016, the report said.Golan Benita, head of the Bank of Israel's markets department, explained the rationale behind this decision, citing the exceptional security situation. He noted concerns that the market could experience significant volatility without such intervention. 
"We are in an unprecedented security situation, and our estimate was that the market could get to a situation of divergence without the announcement of our intervention," he was quoted as saying.The shekel had already weakened by 10% in 2023 due to political instability. Given the expected duration of the conflict with Hamas in Gaza, further depreciation of the shekel was anticipated.Benita highlighted that before the local market opened, the exchange rate had surged to as much as 4.3 shekels per dollar overnight in Asia. Therefore, the bank aimed to reduce market uncertainty and potential overreactions, ensuring regular market activity.Benita emphasized that there are no current plans to exceed the $30 billion forex sale, citing the substantial level of reserves that provide room for economic support during emergencies.HSBC's Neil Churchill commented, "At the current juncture, the central bank's priority is only to ensure a normal functioning of markets."Additionally, the central bank announced its intent to provide liquidity through swap mechanisms in the market, with a commitment of up to $15 billion.The Bank of Israel affirmed its readiness to monitor developments across all markets and deploy available tools as necessary to address the evolving situation.Citi economists noted their expectation of a weaker shekel in the medium term but did not anticipate sustained periods of shekel weakness.Israeli stock and bond markets faced a 7% decline on the previous day, following a deadly incursion by Hamas gunmen from Gaza. However, on Monday, key Tel Aviv share indices rebounded, showing a 1% increase in afternoon trading, while government bond prices displayed mixed trends.Notably, Israel's dollar-denominated government bonds witnessed a sharp decline in early European trading, as investors responded to the unprecedented attack. Most bonds experienced drops ranging from 1.5 to 4 cents, with the 100-year bond maturing in 2120 facing one of its largest daily declines, falling to just 65 cents.Israel has amassed significant forex reserves, exceeding $200 billion, equivalent to nearly 40% of its GDP. This accumulation, which began in 2008, aimed to prevent the shekel from appreciating too sharply and affecting exporters, particularly in the tech sector.HSBC's Churchill highlighted Israel's robust position in emerging markets, noting that its reserves are substantial and meet various metrics comfortably.It's worth noting that the Bank of Israel's last intervention was in January 2022. Last month, Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron expressed that, despite the weaker shekel and resulting inflation, there was no immediate need for intervention due to the absence of market failures.In a display of market confidence, Israel sold 2 billion shekels ($508 million) of bonds locally on Monday, even in the midst of these challenging times.

India abstain as UNGA backs ceasefire, doesn’t condemn Hamas terror

After multiple failures to address the West Asia crisis in the Security Council, the UN adopted a resolution in the General Assembly, which called for immediate, durable and sustainable humanitarian truce, with backing from 120 countries. India abstained from voting on the resolution that didn’t condemn the October 7 Hamas terror attacks on Israel, with government sources saying the final text did not reflect all elements of India’s “steadfast and consistent“ position, including that there can be no equivocation on terrorism. While 45 countries abstained, 14 led by the US and Israel voted against the resolution that was supported by many European countries, including France, and all BRICS and SAARC partners of India. Canada had moved an amendment for an explicit condemnation of Hamas and release of hostages, but it was rejected as it couldn’t get 2/3rd support from the members present and voting.While India voted in favour of the amendment, it didn’t name Hamas in its explanation of vote in which it said that the terror attacks in Israel on October 7 were shocking and deserved condemnation, while calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages. 
Although non-binding, resolutions passed by the General Assembly are seen as an indication of the global mood. Looking to balance its position, the government reiterated its concern over the “astounding” loss of civilian lives, including those of women and children, saying the escalation of hostilities in the region will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis and that it’s necessary for “all parties to display the utmost responsibility”. India was among the few major countries like Japan, Germany and UK that didn’t back the resolution meant to facilitate distribution of humanitarian assistance in Gaza by ensuring a truce, even if only temporarily, despite having announced aid for the Palestinians. There were others like France, Spain and Belgium that voted in favour of the Canadian amendment for naming and condemning Hamas but didn’t allow its defeat to end their support for the resolution seeking “humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities”. France said nothing justified the killing of civilians. Justifying its decision to abstain, seen by many as betraying a pro-Israel tilt, India urged “the parties “ in its explanation of vote to “de-escalate, eschew violence and work towards creating conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations.” “Casualties in the ongoing conflict in Gaza are a telling, serious and continuing concern. Civilians, especially women and children are paying with their lives. This humanitarian crisis needs to be addressed. We welcome the international community’s de-escalation efforts and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. India too has contributed to this effort,” it said, while reiterating support for the 2-state solution. As it sought de-escalation, the government reiterated its strong condemnation of terrorism saying it’s a malignancy and knows no borders, nationality, or race. “The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts. Let us keep aside differences, unite and adopt a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism,” it said. In a carefully worded statement, and remarks that could be applied to both sides, the government also denounced violence, especially when it happens on a scale and intensity that’s an affront to basic human values. “Violence as a means to achieve political objectives damages indiscriminately, and does not pave the way for any durable solutions,” it said. With the resolution not naming Hamas or condemning its terror attack on Israel, the US had accused its Arab allies of empowering Hamas by tabling the same. The resolution had been proposed by Jordan in the General Assembly after 4 attempts to arrive at a consensus on the Gaza situation in the Security Council failed. Significantly, India’s vote was more in tandem with its Quad partners than those in most of the other major multilateral forums it has longstanding engagements with. India’s vote was at variance with all its SCO and BIMSTEC partners , apart from those BRICS and SAARC. In Quad, while the US voted against the resolution, Australia and Japan abstained.

'Felt like Holocaust': Terrified Israelis recount Hamas terror after surprise invasion

NEW DELHI: As Israel battles its broadest invasion in the past five decades, the citizens continue to hunker down in the bomb shelters amid blaring sirens and blazing gun fires.Since the onset of the escalation, numerous videos of assaults and atrocities by the Hamas terrorists have been making the rounds of social media. In one such video, an Israeli journalist couple narrated the ordeal the Jewish citizens have been reeling under. Hananya Naftali and his wife India Naftali, widely popular on social media, shared a video recalling how they woke up to the explosions of rockets ripping through Tel Aviv.The duo claimed that had been, off and on, taking refuge in a bomb shelter."We heard explosions above our heads. These were rockets meant to hit us, civilians," said Hananya."There is an all-time, unprecedented war that we are seeing right on," he said in a video, which he posted on X (formerly Twitter).'Resembles Holocaust'"I think I can speak for everyone in Israel that we have never seen such a situation with hostages, graphic images. 
The first thing that I thought of when I saw some of these images was the Holocaust. I saw images that I wish I could erase from my brain, images of bodies of Israelis butchered, piled up on each other, things that I thought I would never see," India Naftali told an Israeli news channel, i24News."My husband is holding the door of the bomb shelter," said a woman named Doreen told Israel's Channel 12, as per NYT. Panic pounded even those in bomb shelters as they said a "spray of bullets" was being shot at the shelter's windows."Now they're shooting sprays of bullets at the bomb shelter's window. Sprays. And my three children are here with me," she added.'Don't have words'"I feel so incredibly violated,"  68-year-old Adele Raemer, told news agency AP, from a safe room in the southern kibbutz of Nir Am after discovering that Palestinian militants had smashed her windows while trying to break into her house. "This is so tough for us, I don't even have the words," she said.An Israeli told the NYT they knew one day the terrorists would come inside."This was always the nightmare. We told ourselves that one day, the terrorists will come inside here," said Jehan Berman, a 42-year-old in the small community of Avshalom near Gaza. It took eight hours, he said, for the Israeli military to arrive and dispel Hamas fighters.'Hardest day of my life'"We are too scared to go out (from the shelter) even for a second to get water or food or use the bathroom because we know they are still fighting out there," said Janet Cwaigenbaum, a 57-year-old in the southern kibbutz of Nir Yitzhak told news agency AP."I've lived here for so long that I know what to do within 15 seconds of hearing an alarm. But today was different. It was the hardest day of my life," she added.The sudden attacks by Hamas terrorists in the southern and central region of the Jewish state, which came after the end of Sukkot, a weeklong festival for Jews to commemorate the harvest season, have led to unprecedented escalation between the Israeli administration and the terror outfit.After the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel was "at war" and vowed to take "mighty vengeance" against Hamas.Israeli death toll from the Hamas attack, on the second day, has reached around 500-600.

Biden says Hamas terror attack was aimed at thwarting India-Middle East-Europe economic corridor

WASHINGTON: Hamas launched a terror attack on Israel to torpedo the India-Middle East- Europe economic corridor formalised recently at the G20 summit, US President Joe Biden suggested on Wednesday, amid calls for New Delhi to designate Hamas a terrorist group. “I'm convinced one of the reasons Hamas attacked when they did, and I have no proof of this, just my instinct tells me, is because of the progress we were making towards regional integration for Israel, and regional integration overall. We can't leave that work behind,” Biden said at a White House joint press conference with visiting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. 
The ambitious multi-country corridor, which envisages linking India with Europe via UAE, Saudi Arabia and Israel through a rail network, is not only seen as a counter to China's Belt and Road Initiative, but also draws Middle-East antagonists into an economic clinch to the benefit of all. Several experts have surmised that Islamic extremist groups, backed notably by Iran, want to disrupt this in order to preserve unity among the so-called Muslim ummah. UAE and Saudi Arabia have moved in recent years to improve, in not normalize ties with Israel, ending decades of its isolation in the Islamic world.This is the second time in less than a week that Biden has mentioned the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) as a possible reason for the terrorist attack by Hamas. He doubled down on the theory on Wednesday even as he walked a fine line between muscular support for Israel and backing a two-state solution that will give Palestinians an independent state. The position puts New Delhi and Washington on the same page. "Israel has the right and, I would add, responsibility to respond to the slaughter of their people. And we will ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself against these terrorists. That’s a guarantee," Biden said, adding that this "does not lessen the need for (Israel) to operate and align with the laws of war." "It also means that when this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next. And in our view, it has to be a two-state solution," Biden said. Biden's remarks came even as Russia and China on one side and US on the other vetoed each others resolutions in the UN Security Council on the crisis. Key differences in the text included a specific mention in the US-backed proposal of States’ inherent right to self defence, and a call in the Russian-led one for the immediate cancellation by Israeli forces of the evacuation order for civilians to head into southern Gaza.Israel also renewed pressure on India to designate Hamas as a terrorist body. "I think that it's time to officially designate Hamas as a terror organisation in India. Most of the democracies, the EU, US, Canada, and Australia, I believe have already done this," Israel's ambassador to India Naor Gilon said in New Delhi, adding, "India is also a very important moral voice in the world and when it comes to terror, India... knows what they're talking about being victims for so many years of terrorism."

Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma urges united voice for constitutional solution of indigenous people of Northeast India

AGARTALA: Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Kongkal Sangma urged the indigenous communities of Northeast India to join hands leaving aside all differences to ensure a constitutional solution for the tribals of the region while addressing a mammoth rally at Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (ADC) headquarter Khumlung organized by principal opposition party of the state TIPRA Motha on Saturday.Sangma along with a group of MLAs from Meghalaya has joined the rally to express solidarity and extend support to the fight for greater Tipraland and constitutional solution for the indigenous communities of the state, have been persuaded by Motha and its key leader Tripura royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarman."Despite minor differences among the tribal communities of Northeast, our identity is similar to the rest of the country. Although we are identified as a Northeastern community by Delhi, our issues are not dealt with together. As a result, indigenous people of the region have been facing multiple problems and the time has come to become united and raise voice for our rights," Sangma said.Appreciating the 'Thansa" (unity) move of Pradyot Kishore Debbarman, he said efforts have been made to unite all the indigenous people and communities of eight states of the region beyond narrow political interest and power game to spread the voice loudly for the development and ensuring the rights of the people of Northeast and added, "We shall move together to Delhi for our people."Addressing the gathering Pradyot expressed dissatisfaction towards media for not ventilating the issues and challenges of the indigenous communities of Northeast properly rather than giving more space to fight in Israel, Palestine, Pakistan, and the small issues of the so-called mainland. 
He alleged that not only the politicians but the people of Northeast have been marginalized by all other institutions and as a result, the sufferings of the people remain.The atrocities and crisis of Manipur are not reflected in the media properly, Pradyot alleged.He, however, criticized a section of tribal leaders saying that some leaders keep on changing the parties when not get tickets, or sell to other big parties for money, post, or position forgetting the commitment to their people."This time if anybody switches over compromising the interest of the communities, Tiprasa (tribal) will burn down their houses and property," Pradyot threatened adding that power is temporary but rights are permanent for the future. The leaders must remember they are free to choose the party but not compromise beyond the community interest; otherwise, the next generations of tribal will be marginalized and betrayed, he warned and added, "We are poor but not badgers." ADC administration is under TIPRA Motha's rule but frequently Chief Executive Member begs money from the state government. The people are dying 30 -km away from Agartala due to lack of treatment. We shall not allow this to continue anymore," Pradyot stated. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

How this Israeli kibbutz fought back and won against Hamas militant

NEW DELHI: On October 7, Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza, launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking about 200 hostages. It was the most violent assault on Israel in decades.Hamas fighters broke through the Gaza-Israel barrier and invaded several Israeli towns, kibbutzim and military bases in the south. They also attacked thousands of people at a music festival near the border. They used rockets, grenades, guns and explosives to kill and capture civilians and soldiers.In many places, they broke through security fences around Israeli villages near Gaza, killing residents, setting fire to houses with families inside and taking hostages.However, on that day, Mefalsim, an Israeli Kibbutz, became a place where the plans of the Hamas attackers went awry, according to a Wall Street Journal(WSJ) report. 
Over two dozen Hamas fighters from Gaza had arrived with orders to overpower the small security force and corral hostages into the community dining hall. Armed with a detailed map of the kibbutz and a classified attack plan labeled "top secret," they aimed to execute their mission, but their efforts were thwarted.As per the WSJ report, Moshe Kaplan was the security chief of Mefalsim, a kibbutz of 1,000 people in southern Israel. On October 7, at 6:56am, he sent a text message to his volunteer security team, warning them of an attack."They're shooting from the gate!" he wrote after his car was shot at by militants as he passed the main entrance. The attackers then used explosives to open another gate and entered the kibbutz.Kaplan went home to get his helmet, vest and M16 rifle, and then drove to another gate on the northwest side. He saw armed men inside the security fence that surrounded the community."Terrorists in the kibbutz! Terrorists in the kibbutz!" he shouted in another text message, asking his men to come quickly. He heard gunshots in the background. He had trained 12 men for this scenario, an unexpected attack from Gaza. But none of them showed up after 19 minutes, the WSJ report says.Kaplan got out of his car and fired at the assailants from behind a metal trash bin. One of them threw a grenade at him. Luckily for him and Mefalsim, it didn't go off.Kaplan's volunteers came out of their homes with helmets, vests and M16 rifles over their T-shirts. They were outnumbered and fought alone or in pairs. They used walkie-talkies and WhatsApp texts to communicate and help each other.They thought they had to resist until the Israeli army came. At first, they expected the soldiers to arrive soon. But as time went by, and the battle got worse, they realized they were on their own."Where are the tanks?" Yarden Reskin, a 38-year-old landscape architect and security volunteer, asked on his walkie-talkie as bullets flew by. "It became very, very apparent that they weren't coming," he said later.Outside Mefalsim's main gate, bodies and burned cars of people who ran away from the music festival were found later.Scared families at the kibbutz, a 200-acre community with farms and trees, hid in home shelters. Some watched news of attacks in nearby towns on phones and TVs. They heard loud gunfire outside.When Israeli soldiers arrived, they meticulously searched every house in Mefalsim, hunting for any remaining attackers who might be hiding. According to a local resident, the bodies of eight militants were discovered. Two more were fatally shot after being found in a cow shed, while another was captured. The remaining assailants were driven away.Remarkably, none of the residents of Mefalsim were killed or taken hostage, thanks to the courageous efforts of a group of about a dozen residents, many of whom were former Israeli soldiers. These individuals had spent years preparing to defend the kibbutz, and their readiness proved crucial, the WSJ report said."Mefalsim also got lucky," the WSJ report emphasized. Following the attack, residents left the kibbutz, with many relocating to a beachfront hotel north of Tel Aviv. Currently, Mefalsim has been designated a military zone and is off-limits. Despite the challenges, most residents express their determination to return and rebuild their home."There is a sense of unease in the fact that we survived while others did not," Kaplan, the security chief, told the WSJ.

'Wherever they are': Israel PM Netanyahu orders Mossad to target Hamas leaders across world

Israel has announced that the anticipated four-day ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza will be postponed, now set to commence no earlier than Friday. This development delays a significant agreement aimed at pausing the ongoing conflict with Hamas.Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel's national security adviser, confirmed the progress in negotiations regarding the release of at least 50 hostages held by Hamas, but clarified that this would not occur on Thursday as initially planned."The contacts on the release of our hostages are advancing and continuing constantly," Hanegbi said. "The start of the release will take place according to the original agreement between the sides, and not before Friday."Furthermore, another Israeli official indicated that the ceasefire, initially expected to begin on Thursday, would also be delayed. This postponement is a significant setback for the families eagerly awaiting the return of their loved ones and for the over two million residents of Gaza hoping for a respite from 47 days of conflict and hardship.Under the intricate deal, Israel and Hamas had agreed to a four-day truce, which included the release of at least 50 hostages captured during the deadly attacks by the Palestinian militant group on October 7.During a press conference in Tel Aviv, alongside war cabinet members, Prime Minister Netanyahu on Wednesday declared that he had directed Israel's Mossad intelligence agency to pursue Hamas leaders “wherever they are”.Netanyahu's statement followed a report by Kan news, suggesting that Ismail Haniyeh and Khaled Mashaal, Hamas leaders, were “euphoric” over the war and expect to continue ruling Gaza after it ends, a Times of Israel report said.Responding to inquiries about whether the ceasefire would extend to actions against Hamas leaders, particularly those abroad, Netanyahu clarified that there was "no such obligation."Netanyahu emphasized that the ceasefire would be used to prepare for the continuation of the war, ensuring the protection of forces and ongoing intelligence gathering. 
He reiterated Israel's objectives: the removal of Hamas, the return of all hostages, and the establishment of a non-threatening governance in Gaza. He also acknowledged the significant cost of victory, citing the loss of 70 soldiers in the past month.Mossad chief David Barnea, along with Gen Nitzan Alon, reportedly met with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani to finalize the deal's details. The names of the hostages to be released will not be disclosed beforehand to prevent false hope among families.The significance of this visit lies in Barnea's role as the primary negotiator representing Israel. His journey to Qatar underscores the ongoing efforts to resolve outstanding issues in the agreement, particularly the practical aspects of its implementation and determining the precise timing for the ceasefire to commence.MossadThe Mossad, officially known as the Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations, is the national intelligence agency of Israel, one of the key players in the global intelligence community. Established on December 13, 1949, it has evolved into a highly effective and reputed agency, known for its daring covert operations, counterterrorism, and intelligence gathering.Mandate and MissionMossad's primary mandate is to ensure Israel's national security. This includes intelligence gathering related to external threats, conducting covert operations, and counterterrorism. Unlike other intelligence agencies that focus on military intelligence, Mossad is more oriented towards foreign intelligence gathering and strategic operations.Organizational StructureThe agency is headed by a Director, appointed by the Prime Minister, with the current director being David Barnea. The organization is divided into several branches, each specializing in different aspects of intelligence work, such as political espionage, counterterrorism, and cyber intelligence.Notable operationsMossad is renowned for several high-profile operations. One of the most famous is the capture of Adolf Eichmann, a key architect of the Holocaust, in Argentina in 1960, leading to his trial and execution in Israel. Another notable operation was the Entebbe rescue in 1976, where Mossad agents played a crucial role in rescuing hostages from a hijacked Air France plane in Uganda.Controversies and criticismThe agency has been involved in various controversies, including assassinations and alleged violations of international law. Its methods and operations are often shrouded in secrecy, leading to criticism and ethical debates. However, supporters argue that such actions are necessary for the security of Israel in a volatile geopolitical landscape.Technological prowess and cyber intelligenceIn recent years, Mossad has significantly invested in cyber intelligence, becoming a leader in cyber warfare. This shift reflects the changing nature of global threats and the increasing importance of digital intelligence in national security.Global presence and cooperationMossad operates globally, often working in collaboration with other intelligence agencies, including the CIA and MI6. This cooperation is crucial in combating international terrorism and dealing with threats that transcend national borders. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: India has sought to balance its support to Israel on the issue of Hamas terrorism by expressing concern over mounting civilian casualties, underlining the significance of international humanitarian law and reiterating its long-standing support for a sovereign, independent and viable Palestine state. In his talks with President Mahmoud Abbas, PM Modi had told him that Indian will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestine. India's aid has come not a moment too soon as the Arab world, the West and even neighbours like Bangladesh and Pakistan line up humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians.India has otherwise supported Palestine through its contributions to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). India is a member of its advisory commission since 2020. "India increased its annual contribution to UNRWA from $1.2 million to $5 million in 2018. Since 2002, India has contributed a total of $36.5 million to UNRWA till 2022- 23," said an official. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Trump would trounce Biden if presidential polls were held today: Survey

NEW DELHI: If the 2024 US presidential elections were to be held today, former president Donald Trump would trounce Joe Biden by winning nearly 300 electoral votes, well past the 270 majority mark, according to a survey of six battleground states by The New York Times and Siena College.The results show Biden losing to Trump by margins of four to 10 percentage points among registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Biden is ahead only in Wisconsin, by two percentage points, the poll found. A previous NYT/Siena poll published in August had showed the two party frontrunners neck and neck with 43% support each.Biden had won all the six states during the 2020 presidential elections.Voters turning against BidenThe poll found that voters have deep concerns over the President's age and are dissatisfied over his handling of the economy and a host of other issuesThe survey is sure to give the Democratic National Convention a headache, with voters in the swing states stating they trust Trump over Biden on the economy by a 22-point margin, 59% to 37%. Biden also polled weaker than alternative Democrats, even vice president Kamala Harris.For Biden, who turns 81 later this month, being the oldest president in American history stands out as a glaring liability. An overwhelming 71% said he was “too old” to be an effective president — an opinion shared across every demographic, including 54% of Biden’s own supporters.In contrast, only 19% of supporters of Trump, who is 77, viewed him as too old, and 39% of the electorate overall.Large shift from 2020Surprisingly, Trump and Biden are roughly tied among voters under 30 — a large shift from 2020 when young voters came out in droves to support Biden.The survey also reveals the extent to which the multiracial and multigenerational coalition that elected Biden is fraying. 
Demographic groups that backed Biden by landslide margins in 2020 are now far more closely contested, as two-thirds of the electorate sees the country moving in the wrong direction, according to a report by The New York Times.Biden's lead among Hispanic voters is down to single digits and his advantage in urban areas is half of Trump’s edge in rural regions. While women still favour Biden, men prefer Trump by twice as large a margin, reversing the gender advantage that had fueled so many Democratic gains in recent years.The NYT report further said that black voters — long a bulwark for Democrats and for Biden — are now registering 22% support in these states for Trump, a level unseen in presidential politics for a Republican in modern times.Voters preferred Trump over Biden on immigration by 12 points, on national security by 12 points and on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by 11 points. 'Predictions change'In a report by Axios, Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for Biden's re-election, said the latest survey's findings should be taken with a pinch of salt. "Predictions more than a year out tend to look a little different a year later. Don't take our word for it: Gallup predicted an eight point loss for President Obama only for him to win a year later."The Times and Siena polled about 600 registered voters in each of the six states. Trump held the largest lead in Nevada, where 52% of respondents preferred him, to only 41% for Biden. The poll was conducted between October 22 and November 3.Neither Biden nor Trump is expected to face much of a primary challenge. Trump has dominated Republican polls to such a degree that he hasn’t even bothered to show up for debates, despite facing dozens of criminal charges in four different cases.

Agra: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind president Mahmood Asad Madani has condemned the ongoing conflict in Israel and Palestine, especially the attacks on civilians in Israel and bombardment of heavily-populated residential areas in Gaza. 
He also appealed for an "immediate cessation of the war declared by Israel and urgent mediation." In a statement released from Deoband on Monday, the Jamiat, which has its following across the country, called for immediate intervention by the international community, including the UN Security Council and the Arab League.
Highlighting the "root cause of the conflict, namely the occupation of Palestinian territories by Israel", Madani said "Jamiat stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine who have endured 75 years of Israeli oppression and violence. They are like prisoners in their own homeland..." Madani pointed to the "unwavered support for the Palestinian cause" by Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. "The PM of India should play a larger role and use his influence for peace and an immediate end to the loss of civilian lives," he added.

Thiruvananthapuram: The CPM stands with Palestinians fighting for their own country, party state secretary M V Govindan said here on Sunday. As countries world over condemn Israel that is engaged in a genocide in Palestine, the CPM will organise events across the state in support of Palestine, he said.
Govindan told reporters that the IUML had expressed support for the CPM rally on November 11 but was not taking part in it due to technical difficulties as being part of the Congress-led front. “We all understand that the technical difficulty is the opposition raised by the Congress party. The programme, however, has their support. They made it clear in yesterday’s press meet that they support the cause,” he said. TNN

After multiple failures to address the West Asia crisis in the Security Council, the UN adopted a resolution in the General Assembly, which called for immediate, durable and sustainable humanitarian truce, with backing from 120 countries. India abstained from voting on the resolution that didn’t condemn the October 7 Hamas terror attacks on Israel, with government sources saying the final text did not reflect all elements of India’s “steadfast and consistent“ position, including that there can be no equivocation on terrorism. While 45 countries abstained, 14 led by the US and Israel voted against the resolution that was supported by many European countries, including France, and all BRICS and SAARC partners of India. Canada had moved an amendment for an explicit condemnation of Hamas and release of hostages, but it was rejected as it couldn’t get 2/3rd support from the members present and voting.While India voted in favour of the amendment, it didn’t name Hamas in its explanation of vote in which it said that the terror attacks in Israel on October 7 were shocking and deserved condemnation, while calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages. 
Although non-binding, resolutions passed by the General Assembly are seen as an indication of the global mood. Looking to balance its position, the government reiterated its concern over the “astounding” loss of civilian lives, including those of women and children, saying the escalation of hostilities in the region will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis and that it’s necessary for “all parties to display the utmost responsibility”. India was among the few major countries like Japan, Germany and UK that didn’t back the resolution meant to facilitate distribution of humanitarian assistance in Gaza by ensuring a truce, even if only temporarily, despite having announced aid for the Palestinians. There were others like France, Spain and Belgium that voted in favour of the Canadian amendment for naming and condemning Hamas but didn’t allow its defeat to end their support for the resolution seeking “humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities”. France said nothing justified the killing of civilians.Justifying its decision to abstain, seen by many as betraying a pro-Israel tilt, India urged “the parties “ in its explanation of vote to “de-escalate, eschew violence and work towards creating conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations.” “Casualties in the ongoing conflict in Gaza are a telling, serious and continuing concern. Civilians, especially women and children are paying with their lives. This humanitarian crisis needs to be addressed. We welcome the international community’s de-escalation efforts and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. India too has contributed to this effort,” it said, while reiterating support for the 2-state solution. As it sought de-escalation, the government reiterated its strong condemnation of terrorism saying it’s a malignancy and knows no borders, nationality, or race. “The world should not buy into any justification of terror acts. Let us keep aside differences, unite and adopt a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism,” it said. In a carefully worded statement, and remarks that could be applied to both sides, the government also denounced violence, especially when it happens on a scale and intensity that’s an affront to basic human values. “Violence as a means to achieve political objectives damages indiscriminately, and does not pave the way for any durable solutions,” it said. With the resolution not naming Hamas or condemning its terror attack on Israel, the US had accused its Arab allies of empowering Hamas by tabling the same. The resolution had been proposed by Jordan in the General Assembly after 4 attempts to arrive at a consensus on the Gaza situation in the Security Council failed. Significantly, India’s vote was more in tandem with its Quad partners than those in most of the other major multilateral forums it has longstanding engagements with. India’s vote was at variance with all its SCO and BIMSTEC partners , apart from those BRICS and SAARC. In Quad, while the US voted against the resolution, Australia and Japan abstained.

US president Biden condemns 'sheer evil' of Hamas attacks, says Americans among hostages in Israel

WASHINGTON: In a powerful and emotional address from the White House on Tuesday, President Joe Biden condemned the recent attacks by Hamas on the United States' ally, Israel. The President labeled these acts as "sheer evil" and pledged the readiness of the United States to deploy additional military assets to the region to support Israel.During his televised speech, President Biden described the horrifying actions carried out by the Palestinian militant group, including the murder of entire families, sexual assaults on women, and distressing reports of infants losing their lives. His voice somber and determined, Biden emphasized, "There are moments in this life when pure unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world. This is an act of sheer evil."President Biden also confirmed that at least 14 Americans had lost their lives in the attacks, and some had been taken hostage by Hamas. 
The militant group had issued threats to harm these hostages unless Israel warned civilians about impending attacks on Gaza.A staunch supporter of Israel for many years, President Biden reiterated the United States' unwavering commitment to stand by Israel's side. He declared, "We will support Israel today, tomorrow, as we always have."In a clear message to long-standing adversary Iran, which backs Hamas, Biden sternly warned Israel's adversaries with a single word: "Don't."Before delivering his remarks, President Biden held a prolonged conversation with Vice President Kamala Harris and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss their support for Israel.Taking to social media, Biden shared a picture of his meeting with Harris and top US military, intelligence, and diplomatic officials in the secure White House Situation Room. He wrote, "We connected with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss coordination to support Israel, deter hostile actors, and protect innocent people."Key figures in the US government, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and CIA chief William Burns, were present during this meeting. Additionally, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and top military officer Charles "CQ" Brown joined via video from a NATO meeting in Brussels.The US State Department announced Secretary Blinken's upcoming visit to Israel on Thursday to demonstrate "solidarity and support" during these challenging times.In response to the Hamas attacks, the United States has dispatched fresh military assistance to Israel. The US Navy has also ordered its largest aircraft carrier to move closer to Israel, along with other warships and fighter jets, in a display of support.President Biden made it clear that he was prepared to deploy "additional assets" if necessary to reinforce Washington's backing of its ally and increase its presence in the volatile region.However, the conflict has given rise to a hostage crisis for the United States, posing a complex challenge for President Biden. Hamas currently holds around 150 hostages, including children, the elderly, and young individuals. The group has issued threats to execute hostages each time Israel strikes a civilian target in Gaza without prior warning.National Security Council spokesman John Kirby emphasized the gravity of this threat, stating, "You can't take a threat like that lightly because of the barbarity that Hamas has already shown they're capable of."The United States has extended its offer of intelligence assistance and expertise in hostage recovery to Israel.President Biden's response to the crisis is under intense scrutiny both domestically, with the upcoming US presidential election, where Republicans accuse him of being lenient towards Iran, the sponsor of Hamas, and in the region, amid concerns of a potential broader conflict.In a joint statement issued on Monday, President Biden, along with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, and Britain, cautioned against any party exploiting the attacks on Israel for their advantage, emphasizing that "this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage."(Inputs from ) For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Bengaluru: Multiple unsigned posters reading, 'Jews have been murdering innocent souls', were put up at a bus stand on Residency Road on Tuesday. They remained in place on Wednesday too.
Bengaluru has seen multiple pro-Palestine protests in the past few weeks, but the posters, which are typed and printed, don't make any direct reference to the ongoing crisis involving Israel and Palestine. With no physical activity - protest or sloganeering - the posters are only symbolic.
Several activists have issued pro-Palestine statements in Bengaluru since the conflict began, condemning Israel. The city has also seen sudden protests on MG Road. Last week, police had detained a group of activists for gathering without permission. A day later, police booked a case of public nuisance.
