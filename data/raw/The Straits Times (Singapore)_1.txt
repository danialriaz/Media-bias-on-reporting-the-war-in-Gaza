Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories referred to UN court

Body


NEW YORK  The UN General Assembly on Friday asked the International Court of Justice to consider consequences for Israel over its occupation of Palestinian territories, a day after the Jewish state's most right-wing government ever took over. 
 The General Assembly voted 87-26 with 53 abstentions on the resolution, with Western nations split but virtually unanimous support in the Islamic world -- including Arab states that have normalised relations with Israel -- and backing from Russia and China.
 The resolution calls on the UN court in The Hague to determine the "legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination" as well as of its measures "aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status" of the holy city of Jerusalem. 
 Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour said the vote sent a signal to the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over its efforts to "accelerate colonial and racist policies", and hailed nations that were "undeterred by threats and pressure". 
 "We trust that regardless of your vote today, if you believe in international law and peace, you will uphold the opinion of the International Court of Justice when delivered," Mr Mansour said.
 Speaking ahead of the vote, Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan called the resolution "a moral stain on the UN". 
 "No international body can decide that the Jewish people are occupiers in their own homeland.
 "Any decision from a judicial body which receives its mandate from the morally bankrupt and politicised UN is completely illegitimate," he said. 
 The resolution also demands that Israel cease building settlements but General Assembly votes have no legal force -- unlike those in the Security Council where the US, an ally of Israel, has veto power.
 The US, Britain and Germany opposed the resolution, while France abstained. 
 "We do not feel that a referral to the International Court of Justice is helpful in bringing the parties back to dialogue," British diplomat Thomas Phipps said. 
 "It is the position of the UK that it is inappropriate without the consent of both parties to ask the court to give an advisory opinion in what is essentially a bilateral dispute."
 Among Western nations that backed the resolution was Portugal, whose representative acknowledged the "risk of overjudicialising international relations" but said the world court "underpins the international rules-based order which we seek to preserve". AFP

New Israeli govt must tread with care

Byline: , New Israeli govt must tread with care

Mr Benjamin Netanyahu's return as Israel's Prime Minister for the sixth time, this time leading a coalition with far-right parties, has caused some unease both at home and abroad. The new government's political agenda could exacerbate the conflict with the Palestinians and jeopardise the long proposed two-state solution, it is feared. The greatest point of worry is a provocative clause in the coalition agreement struck between Mr Netanyahu's Likud party and his ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox Jewish allies. It centres on a government commitment to advancing and developing settlements across Israel. Controversially, this includes the West Bank, where some 2.5 million Palestinians live alongside more than 500,000 Israelis who inhabit settlements considered illegal by the majority of the international community. There are also some 100 "outposts", which are small settlements built without government authorisation across the West Bank, which Mr Netanyahu has agreed to legalise retroactively. Such moves can destabilise the fragile peace in the Middle East. The tensions may easily ripple into South-east Asia, where the Palestinian cause has had resonance. 
 Also at risk is Mr Netanyahu's goal of expanding peace deals with Arab states, including Saudi Arabia. As part of the US-brokered Abraham Accords that he engineered in 2020, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco had established official ties with Israel motivated by shared concerns over regional rival Iran's growing nuclear ambitions, as well as the obvious synergies between Arab and Israeli economies. But progress could quickly unravel if the new government, under pressure from its coalition allies, overturns delicate prayer arrangements at the contested Al-Aqsa mosque. On the domestic front, some flashpoints are already visible. The government's positions on LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) rights, racism and the country's minority Arab population have sparked protests over fears that the Jewish homeland's secular political traditions could be undermined. However, Israel remains a democracy and a beacon of political hope in the region.
 That said, Israel's is yet another example of a global surge in far-right politics in recent years. Italy in October elected its most far-right government since Benito Mussolini. In Sweden, a party with neo-Nazi roots won a fifth of the votes, while rightist leaders have consolidated bases in Hungary and Poland. In Germany and France, exclusionary parties such as Alternative for Germany and the National Rally made substantial inroads into Parliament. The fracturing political consensus is hardly reassuring in a world rattled in 2022 by a war in Europe, spiking cross-strait tensions, an unprecedented number of missile launches by North Korea, and other chronic crises. May peaceful and productive forces resurface this year.

Zero tolerance against those who plan to join foreign conflicts: Shanmugam

Byline: Goh Yan Han, Zero tolerance against those who plan to join foreign conflicts: Shanmugam
Body


 The Republic has a clear zero-tolerance policy against individuals who are thinking of going abroad to fight for any cause, but it will also not barricade itself, Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam said on Wednesday.
 There are legitimate organisations and ways to support various causes that people believe in, "but armed violence is different, unacceptable", he said.
 "What we cannot do is to support terrorism, support armed conflict, plan to kill people."
 Individuals who want to carry out armed violence abroad will be arrested, he added, just like 38-year-old Ministry of Education teacher Mohamed Khairul Riduan Mohamed Sarip, whom the Internal Security Department (ISD) announced on Wednesday had been arrested and detained under the Internal Security Act in October 2022.
 Khairul had been influenced by radical videos online, including the teachings of foreign preachers who convinced him to engage in armed jihad. He had planned to travel to Gaza to join Hamas and its military wing and carry out armed combat against the Israel Defence Forces, said ISD.
 Speaking to media at the Ministry of Home Affairs headquarters in Novena, Mr Shanmugam said Singapore will take steps against such individuals when they are in the planning stage, unlike other countries who may only do so after their citizens are already involved or have committed attacks.
 Singapore also works closely with community partners and organisations to spread the message against terrorism, he added. 
 "I think that's one reason why you see far fewer people from Singapore getting involved with this compared with many other countries," he said. "But far fewer doesn't mean zero." 
 Asked about a terror threat report that said the easing of Covid-19-related movement restrictions could lead to a resurgence of terrorist activity in the region, Mr Shanmugam said the solution cannot be to turn Singapore into a fortress.
 People want to be able to go about their lives feeling secure, but without feeling like they are in a prison, with many restrictions. 
 This is why the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, and other Home Team agencies have the difficult task of balancing the ease of movement in and out of Singapore with maintaining safety and security, he said.
 "You cannot become a cantonment and a barricade because somebody from Singapore wants to go abroad to do bad things, or you're worried that somebody from abroad is going to come to Singapore and do bad things," said Mr Shanmugam.
  "We are an international business city; you want to be open for business." 
 A recent report by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) said the primary terrorist threat to Singapore still comes from self-radicalised individuals, but that there was evidence of terror groups renewing their outreach to Muslims in Singapore and the region as travel restrictions ease.
 "(There is) a lot of assessment of information, assessment of travellers, a lot of intelligence work to see who is coming in, what do we need to do to pick up some who may be potentially troublesome, and also who within Singapore may potentially engage in such activities," he said.
 Mr Shanmugam also made clear that the authorities did not detain Khairul for his support of Palestine, but because he planned to carry out armed violence.
 He said that there are many causes around the world, including Palestine, that Singaporeans can and do take views on and provide moral, financial and other means of support to advance them.
 "There are legitimate organisations that Singaporeans can partner to support these causes all around the world, including the cause of helping Palestinians," he said.
 Islamic educator Fathurrahman Dawoed said it is possible for anyone, including teachers, to become self-radicalised, which is why people must continually educate themselves, and their children, about the potential dangers of online radicalisation.
 Individuals have to ensure the source of information is reliable and not accept all information they find online at face value without referring to someone more knowledgeable, said the executive director of Andalus Corporation, which runs a chain of Islamic education centres.
 ISD said on Wednesday that Khairul's interest in the Israel-Palestine conflict began in 2007 after he viewed Facebook videos that purportedly showed Israeli acts of aggression against Palestinians, including women and children.
 His subsequent online research into the conflict entrenched his belief that the Israelis, particularly the Israel Defence Forces, were oppressing the Palestinians.
 He was further convinced of the need to engage in armed defence of the Palestinians after he watched videos by radical foreign preachers such as Ahmed Deedat and Zakir Naik, which discussed the concept of armed jihad in defence of Islam.
 Ahmed, who died in 2005, was barred from entering Singapore in 1982 after making inflammatory speeches here and inciting local Muslims to be militant against other groups. Zakir, his protege, has been barred from entering Singapore since 2014 for his segregationist and extremist teachings.
 Separately, ISD said on Wednesday that Restriction Orders (ROs) under the ISA against three Singaporeans were allowed to lapse upon expiry as they had shown good progress in their rehabilitation.
 One of them, Mohamed Rashid Zainal Abidin, 63, is a former Jemaah Islamiah member who was detained in May 2006 and released on an RO in May 2014. His RO was allowed to lapse in May 2022.
 Dian Faezah Ismail, 40, a self-radicalised individual who supported the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, was issued with an RO in August 2016. Her RO was allowed to lapse in August 2022.
 The last person is Razali Abas, 60, a self-radicalised individual who supported the use of armed violence against the perceived enemies of Islam who was issued with an RO in October 2018. His RO was allowed to lapse in October 2022.
 People with ROs are not allowed to change their residence or employment or travel out of Singapore without the approval of the director of ISD. They also cannot access the Internet or social media, issue public statements, or be a member of any organisation, association or group, among other restrictions, without the approval of the director of ISD.

Teacher arrested under ISA for planning to fight in Palestine

 A 38-year-old Ministry of Education (MOE) teacher has been detained for planning to travel to Palestine and engage in armed jihad.
 Mohamed Khairul Riduan Mohamed Sarip was arrested in October 2022 under the Internal Security Act, the Internal Security Department (ISD) said on Wednesday. He was influenced by radical videos online, including the teachings of foreign preachers.
 He is the first public servant to have been dealt with for terrorism-related offences, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said on Wednesday.
 "We have made clear our policy that if you think of going abroad to fight for any cause, we will arrest you and we have a zero-tolerance approach," he said. "We have arrested others who have similarly thought of going to fight."
 ISD said  that Khairul, who is a Singaporean, was ready to travel to Gaza, Palestine, to carry out armed violence. To avoid detection, he had planned to pretend he was rendering humanitarian aid.
 Khairul intended to join Hamas and its military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (AQB), and take part in armed combat against the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), it added.
 He was willing to abide by any instructions given by Hamas, including taking part in armed combat, kidnapping and even executing prisoners of war. He was confident of applying the weapons-handling skills and fieldcraft acquired during his national service, which he served from 2004 to 2006, to engage in armed combat, said ISD.
 "Khairul was certain that he would achieve martyrdom if he were to die while performing armed jihad," said ISD.
 He also attempted to learn Arabic to communicate with Hamas and AQB soldiers when in Gaza.
 ISD said Khairul also considered being a spokesman and international recruiter for Hamas, and was prepared to facilitate the travel of any individuals interested in joining the armed conflict.
 "He believed that it was his religious obligation to 'spread the truth' about the conflict, and intended to report on the situation in Gaza if he managed to travel there," said ISD. "He was convinced that providing first-hand updates of the conflict on social media would increase the credibility of his postings and encourage others to join Hamas." 
 ISD said that apart from supporting armed violence, Khairul had also tried, unsuccessfully, to influence his family members and children to adopt his segregationist and hardline religious beliefs.
 For example, he shared videos of lectures by radical Indian preacher Zakir Naik on his Facebook page, including one in which Zakir stated that Muslims should not wish Christians "Merry Christmas". He also forbade his children from celebrating birthdays.
 ISD said its investigations so far showed that Khairul had acted alone and there was no sign he tried to involve others in his plans to travel to Gaza to carry out armed violence. There is also no indication thus far that Khairul harboured any intention to carry out attacks in Singapore.
 Mr Shanmugam said that investigations have not turned up evidence that Khairul had tried to influence his students on his beliefs, such as towards armed violence or in support of Hamas.
 The Ministry of Education (MOE) said in response to queries that Khairul has not been teaching any classes since October 2022. 
 "This case reflects the ever-present dangers of radicalisation, including online radicalisation, which all of us must remain vigilant against," said the ministry. "MOE regards this case very seriously and will continue to work closely with ISD and the community to safeguard our schools and students against such threats."
 In response to queries from The Straits Times, an ISD spokesman said prior to Khairul, it had investigated other public servants for suspected radicalisation but none of them was serious enough to be dealt with under the ISA.
 "Some were assessed to be vulnerable or in nascent stages of radicalisation, and they were issued with warnings and sent for religious counselling," she said.
 Khairul had first considered travelling to Gaza in 2012 after coming across a poster on Facebook calling for volunteers for a humanitarian mission to Gaza. 
 ISD said Khairul had made preparations to travel to Gaza since 2012, with the aim of establishing contact with Hamas and AQB upon his arrival. He researched travel routes and flights to Gaza, and sought the advice of foreign individuals who were either based in or intended to travel to Gaza.  
 ISD said he was issued an Order of Detention under the Internal Security Act with effect from Nov 30, 2022. "Given his deeply entrenched radical beliefs and support for armed violence, Khairul poses an imminent threat and has been issued an Order of Detention," it said. 
 Firm action will be taken against any individual in Singapore who supports, promotes, undertakes or makes preparations to undertake armed violence, regardless of how they rationalise such violence, or where the violence takes place, ISD said on Wednesday. "This is particularly so if the person involved is a public servant," it said. 
 ISD said it has been working with other government agencies and community partners to reach out to different segments in the community to raise public awareness of the threat of terrorism and online radicalisation. 
 In particular, MOE has been a key partner since 2007 to reach out to educators, students and youth. 
 In view of the growing trend of youth radicalisation, such outreach efforts have been intensified in recent years, it added. Eight self-radicalised Singaporeans aged between 16 and 20 have been issued with Orders of Detention or Restriction Orders  under the ISA since 2015.
 In 2022, ISD organised at least 69 counter-terrorism or counter-radicalisation outreach events, both online and in-person, for more than 2,300 participants, including student leaders, educators and other school staff.

Israel strikes Gaza as tensions rise after West Bank clashes

Body


JERUSALEM  Israeli jets struck Gaza early on Friday in retaliation for two rockets fired by Palestinian militants, further escalating tensions after one of the worst days of violence in the occupied West Bank in years.
 The rockets fired from Gaza overnight set off alarms in Israeli communities near the border with the southern coastal strip controlled by the Islamist movement Hamas, but there were no reports of casualties. 
 The leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement in Gaza claimed responsibility for rockets fired from the enclave late on Thursday.
 "The Jerusalem Brigades' rocket unit responded," Mr Khaled Al-Batsh told a rally in Gaza on Friday.
 The cross-border fire came after an Israeli raid on a refugee camp in the West Bank on Thursday that killed at least nine Palestinians, including militant gunmen and at least two civilians, the highest single-day death toll in years.
 Another man died in a separate incident in al-Ramm outside Jerusalem, bringing the Palestinian death toll so far in 2023 to at least 30.
 The raid, the latest in a near-daily series of clashes in the West Bank over the past year, came days before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to visit Israel and the West Bank.
 Palestinian officials said Central Intelligence Agency director William Burns, who was visiting Israel and the West Bank on a trip arranged before the latest violence, would meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday. 
 No comment was immediately available from US officials in Jerusalem.  
 The months of violence, which surged after a spate of lethal attacks in Israel last year, have drawn fears that the conflict could spiral out of control, triggering a broader confrontation between Palestinians and Israel.
 The US State Department issued a statement on Thursday saying it was deeply concerned about the violence in the West Bank and urged both sides to de-escalate the conflict.
 The United Nations, Egypt and Qatar have also urged calm, Palestinian officials said.
 In Gaza, large rallies were planned for the afternoon following Friday prayers, as residents inured to years of exchanges of rockets and air strikes between Israel and Hamas feared further clashes. 
 "We didn't sleep the whole night, with the bombing and missiles," said 50-year-old Abdallah Al-Husary. "There is worry and there is fear, any minute a war can happen. With any clash in the West Bank, there can be war along the borders in Gaza."
 In the aftermath of Thursday's raid, the Palestinian Authority, which has limited governing powers in the West Bank, said it was suspending a security cooperation arrangement with Israel that is widely credited with helping to keep order in the territory and preventing attacks against Israel.
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who returned to power this year at the head of one of the most right-wing governments in Israel's history, said Israel was not looking to escalate the situation, although he ordered security forces to be on alert. 
 The Israeli Defence Forces said Friday's air strikes in Gaza targeted an underground rocket manufacturing site and a military base used by Hamas. REUTERS

Israeli army boosting forces in West Bank after synagogue shooting

JERUSALEM  Israel's military said it was boosting its forces in the occupied West Bank a day after a Palestinian gunman shot dead seven people on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and another shooting attack in the city on Saturday wounded two people. 
 The attacks come towards the end of a month of growing confrontation and follow an Israeli raid in the West Bank that killed nine Palestinians, including seven gunmen, and cross-border fire between Israel and Gaza that heightened fears of a spiral in bloodshed. 
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new Cabinet, which includes hardline nationalist parties that have called for stronger action against Palestinians, was due to meet later on Saturday. 
 Friday's attack outside a synagogue was the deadliest in the city area since 2008. The gunman, Khairi Alqam, was a 21-year-old Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, according to police. He struck in an area that Israel annexed to Jerusalem after the 1967 war. 
 Police said he had tried to flee by car but was pursued by officers and shot dead. Forty-two suspects, including members of the gunman's family, have been arrested.
 On Saturday, police said a 13-year-old boy from East Jerusalem opened fire and wounded two people before he was shot and wounded by passers-by.
 That incident took place around Silwan, a Palestinian neighbourhood in East Jerusalem that lies below the Old City walls and where Israeli settlers have stepped up their presence over the past few years.
 The attacks underlined the potential for an escalation in violence after months of clashes in the West Bank, culminating in a raid in Jenin on Thursday that killed at least nine Palestinians, the deadliest such raid in years.
 "Following an IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) situational assessment, it was decided to reinforce the Judea and Samaria (West Bank) Division with an additional battalion," the military said.
 On Friday night, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited the site of the attack, where he was greeted with a mixture of cheers and anger. "The government has to respond, God willing, this is what will happen," he said.
 Mr Netanyahu urged people not to take the law into their own hands but said measures had been decided.
 Friday's shooting, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, was condemned by the White House and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who urged "utmost restraint". It came days before a planned visit by United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel and the West Bank. 
 Jordan and Egypt, Arab countries that have signed peace treaties with Israel, condemned the shooting, as did the United Arab Emirates, one of several Arab states that normalised relations with Israel just over two years ago.
 Lebanon's Iran-backed group Hezbollah praised the attack, and a spokesman for the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas hailed it as "a response to the crime conducted by the occupation in Jenin and a natural response to the occupation's criminal actions". 
 The smaller militant group Islamic Jihad also praised the attack without claiming responsibility.
 Illustrating the simmering violence, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday that three Palestinians were taken to hospital after being shot by an Israeli settler in an incident near the northern West Bank city of Nablus.
 Police said the gunman in the Friday attack in Jerusalem arrived at 8.15pm and opened fire with a handgun, hitting a number of people before he was killed by police. 
 Mr Shimon Israel, 56, who lives nearby, said his family were starting their Sabbath dinner when they heard shooting and screaming. He opened the window and saw his neighbour running on the street to get the police.
 "I told him 'Eli, don't go there. Eli don't go.' He got married only a year ago. A good neighbour, like a brother. He ran. I saw him fall there," Mr Israel told Reuters. 
 "Natali, his wife, ran after him. She saw someone here and was trying to resuscitate him. The terrorist came and shot her from behind and got her too," he said.
 Earlier on Friday, militants in Gaza fired rockets at Israel, causing no casualties but drawing air strikes by Israeli jets, which struck targets in the blockaded coastal strip controlled by Hamas.
 Violence in the West Bank surged after a spate of lethal attacks in Israel in 2022. The latest season of violence began under the previous coalition government and has continued under Mr Netanyahu's right-wing administration, which includes parties that want to expand settlements in the West Bank. 
 Before Friday's shooting, at least 30 Palestinians -- militants and civilians -- had been killed in 2023 and the Palestinian Authority, which has limited governing powers in the West Bank, said it was suspending a security cooperation arrangement with Israel. REUTERS

Blinken kicks off Mid-East tour amid violence

Body


WASHINGTON  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived on Sunday in Egypt at the start of a Middle East trip on which he will look to notch down Israeli-Palestinian tensions after an eruption of violence. 
 Mr Blinken, who will travel on Monday and Tuesday to Jerusalem and Ramallah, had long planned the visit to see Israel's new right-wing government, but the trip takes on a new urgency after some of the worst violence in years.
 A Palestinian gunman on Friday killed seven people outside a synagogue in a settler neighbourhood of east Jerusalem, and another attack followed on Saturday.
 On Thursday, nine people were killed in an Israeli army raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank in one of the deadliest such operations in years. Israel said it was targeting Islamic Jihad militants and also hit the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip in response to rocket fire.
 Mr Blinken will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas and call "broadly for steps to be taken to de-escalate tensions", State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters as he condemned the "horrific" synagogue attack.
 The violence is also likely to figure in talks between Mr Blinken and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whose country's traditional role as a Middle East mediator has helped him remain a key US partner despite President Joe Biden's criticism of his human rights record.
 The United States, with its close relationship to Israel, has historically taken a lead on Middle East diplomacy. 
 But experts questioned whether Mr Blinken could achieve any breakthroughs.
 "The absolute best they can do is to keep things stable to avoid another May 2021," said Mr Aaron David Miller, a veteran US negotiator, referring to more than two weeks of fighting between Israel and Hamas that ended with an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire.
 Mr Ghaith Al-Omari, a former Palestinian official now at The Washington Institute, expected Mr Blinken to repeat traditional US positions. 
 "The trip itself is the message," he said. "Blinken will ask Abbas to do more but it is not clear what they can do," he said, referring to the Palestinians.
 Mr Blinken's visit is part of an effort by the Biden administration to engage quickly with Mr Netanyahu, who returned to office in late December leading the most right-wing government in Israel's history.
 Israel's longest-serving prime minister had a fraught relationship with the last Democratic president, Mr Barack Obama, as Mr Netanyahu openly sides with his Republican adversaries against US diplomacy with Iran.
 Mr Biden's national security adviser, Mr Jake Sullivan, visited earlier in January to discuss Iran after Mr Biden's efforts to restore a 2015 nuclear accord -- despised by Mr Netanyahu -- effectively died.
 "I've never seen such an intense flurry of high-level contacts under any administration as you're watching right now," said Mr Miller, now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
 The Biden team is looking "to avoid confrontation with Netanyahu," Mr Miller said, noting the strong support for the Israeli leader among Republicans, who now control the House of Representatives.
 Mr David Makovsky, also at the Washington Institute, said he also understood that CIA Director Bill Burns has been visiting the region. "It looks a little like flooding the zone," he said.
 Mr Netanyahu has hailed as a key achievement the normalisation of relations in 2020 with the United Arab Emirates, which has moved full speed ahead on developing ties despite public concerns over the new government's moves.
 Mr Blinken is expected on his trip to reiterate US support for a Palestinian state, a prospect that few expect to advance under the new Israeli government.
 The State Department said Mr Blinken would also call for the preservation of the status quo at the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound, which is holy both to Jews and Muslims. 
 Mr Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right ideologue who holds a security post in Mr Netanyahu's government, defiantly visited the site, which Jews call the Temple Mount, in early January.
 In Egypt, Mr Blinken is also expected to discuss regional issues such as Libya and Sudan, the State Department said. 
 Egypt remains one of the top recipients of US military assistance, but the cooperation faces scrutiny from parts of Mr Biden's Democratic Party due to Mr Sisi's rights record.
 Authorities released hundreds of political prisoners last year, but rights groups estimate some 60,000 remain in detention, with many facing harsh conditions and overcrowded cells. AFP

Singapore condemns 'abhorrent attack' outside Jerusalem synagogue

Singapore strongly condemns the "abhorrent attack" outside a synagogue in Jerusalem last Friday, which coincided with the International Holocaust Remembrance Day. 
 "We express our condolences to the families of the victims and wish the injured a swift recovery," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said on Sunday. 
 Seven people were killed last Friday evening when a 21-year-old Palestinian fired on passers-by near a synagogue in the settlement neighbourhood of Neve Yaakov, reported AFP. 
 The violence continued on Saturday, when a 13-year-old Palestinian boy shot and wounded an Israeli father and his son in Silwan, just outside the walled Old City of east Jerusalem.
 The violence in Jerusalem came after one of the deadliest Israeli army raids in the occupied West Bank in two decades. 
 Nine Palestinians were killed last Thursday in what Israel described as a "counter-terrorism" operation in the Jenin refugee camp.
 Israel said its forces were targeting Islamic Jihad operatives. Both Islamic Jihad and Hamas later fired rockets at Israeli territory, but most of them were intercepted by Israeli air defences, reported AFP. 
  "Singapore is deeply concerned about the escalation of violence in Jerusalem and the West Bank," MFA said. 
 "We mourn the loss of innocent lives and injuries to Palestinian civilians in Jenin on Jan 26, 2023."
 MFA also "urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint and de-escalate tensions to prevent further loss of civilian lives", as both Israelis and Palestinians "deserve to live in peace and security".
 The ministry added that there are "currently no reports of any Singaporeans affected by the attack in Jerusalem".
 Singaporeans in Israel are advised to exercise caution, monitor the local news and follow the instructions of local authorities. 
 Those who plan to travel to Israel are strongly encouraged to e-register with MFA on its website eregister.mfa.gov.sg

RAMALLAH, West Bank  Israeli forces killed a 17-year-old Palestinian on Tuesday during a raid in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said, with the army describing the youth as a gunman who had fired on troops. 
 Hamzeh al-Ashkar was shot in the face by soldiers who raided the northern city of Nablus around dawn, the ministry said.
 "He was armed and was firing on the (Israeli) forces," a military spokesman said when asked about the incident.
 The Den of Lions, a group of Nablus fighters with loose factional affiliations, said some of its members exchanged fire with Israeli forces who had "stormed a housing area".
 The group said the teenager who was killed was from the Askar refugee camp near Nablus, but did not claim him as a member.
 Also early on Tuesday, Israeli forces arrested at least 18 Palestinians in the northern West Bank town of Burqin near Jenin, the Palestinian Prisoners Club advocacy group said.
 The operations come during a time of heightened tensions that have drawn fears of a further escalation in violence.
 On Jan 27, a Palestinian gunman killed seven people near a synagogue in East Jerusalem, a day after an Israeli raid in the West Bank city of Jenin in which 10 Palestinians, including eight gunmen, were killed.
 The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 42 Palestinians, civilians and militants, have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers since Jan 1.
 Israel says the raids are a security measure targeting suspected militants. Palestinians consider the raids a form of collective punishment and say they are fighting against decades of Israeli occupation. 
 The violence has prompted calls for calm on both sides from the United States and international organisations, including the United Nations. REUTERS

Singapore among countries most admired by Indonesians: Survey

Body


JAKARTA  Singapore's economic success, safety and cleanliness have placed it among the top countries admired by Indonesians, along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey, according to a new study. But the US and Europe fared worse than Russia, while suspicions of China left it the least admired country. 
 The Indonesia National Survey Project by the ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute found that 89.1 per cent of 1,620 respondents said they respected Singapore, which came in third after Saudi Arabia at 95.7 per cent and Turkey at 90.1 per cent.
 When asked which country is important to Indonesia, Saudi Arabia also ranked highest, with 97.4 per cent of respondents choosing it. This was followed by Singapore at 90.8 per cent, and Turkey at 90.4 per cent. 
 Saudi Arabia's popularity stems primarily from it being the location of Islam's two holiest places, the Kaabah in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, said Dr Burhanuddin Muhtadi, a visiting fellow in ISEAS' Indonesia Studies Programme.
 "Every year, Muslims from all over the world visit this country on pilgrimage," said Dr Burhanuddin, one of the three academics who worked on the survey. Turkey's high ranking also stems from it being a majority-Muslim country. 
 Singapore's appeal to Indonesians lies in how safe, clean and economically successful it is, said PermataBank chief economist Josua Pardede, who added: "Indonesians have a positive perception of Singapore because it is considered a tourist destination (and) is the closest country in terms of distance. Singapore also offers a safer and cleaner urban landscape and law enforcement."
 "In terms of the state of the economy, Singapore is considered a developed country in Asean, which could be a benchmark for Indonesians."
 Singapore's bilateral trade with Indonesia was $59.1 billion in 2021, a 21 per cent increase from the year before. The total value of Singapore's investments in Indonesia was US$9.4 billion (S$12.5 billion) in 2021. Since 2014, Singapore has also occupied the top spot on the list of Indonesia's investors.
 The study, conducted face to face in July 2022, polled respondents across all 34 Indonesian provinces. It is published once every five years. 
 Besides Dr Burhanuddin, the other two researchers are Dr Siwage Dharma Negara and Dr Hui Yew-Foong, who both coordinate ISEAS' Indonesia Studies Programme.
 The study's authors noted that Russia was seen more positively than the United States and the European Union. According to the data, 86.8 per cent of the respondents said they admired Russia, compared with 81.8 per cent for the US and 86.5 per cent for the EU. 
 Dr Burhanuddin said that anti-American and anti-Western sentiments are among the reasons why Indonesians place Russia above the West. "These feelings are based on the perception that America and the West have treated Muslims unfairly," he said, highlighting foreign policy in the Middle East, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
 China was the least admired, with 78.2 per cent of respondents saying that they looked up to it.
 According to the study, 34.1 per cent of respondents said that they considered China's impact on Indonesia to be negative, while 27.1 per cent saw the impact as positive.
 "As China assumes its new-found status as a global economic powerhouse, Indonesians tend to remain suspicious of China's overtures," said Dr Hui.
 The study found that 60.3 per cent of respondents saw China's Belt and Road Initiative in a bad light. The multi-trillion-dollar investment scheme involves development and programmes in more than 100 countries to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route from Asia to Europe.
 Some Indonesians could perceive the initiative as a "financial debt trap for other countries", including Indonesia, leaving them heavily indebted to China. 
 "Domestically, Indonesians may be wary of competition from Chinese foreign workers, who make up almost half of all foreign labourers in Indonesia," added Dr Hui.

8-year-old dies of injuries in Jerusalem car attack

JERUSALEM An eight-year-old boy has died of his injuries from a car ramming attack on a bus stop in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem that also killed his brother, a hospital said on Saturday.
 It takes the total killed to three in the attack on Friday in Ramot, a Jewish settlement neighbourhood of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.
 "Eight-year-old Asher Menahem Paley, who was seriously injured in the Ramot attack, has died," Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek hospital said, in a statement.
 "He arrived in critical condition... many teams from the trauma unit, emergency, paediatric intensive care, paediatric surgery and neurosurgery fought for many hours for his life."
 The other victims were Paley's younger brother, Yaakov Yisrael Paley, aged six, and 20-year-old Alter Shlomo Lederman, a Jewish yeshiva student.
 Four others were injured in the attack, including the father of the two boys, who remains in hospital, and another son, aged 10, according to medics and Israeli media.
 Police said that at around 1.30pm on Friday, the driver of the car, a 31-year-old resident of Issawiya, a Palestinian neighbourhood of east Jerusalem, hit "at high speed... innocent people waiting at the bus stop".
 The suspected attacker was "neutralised on the spot".
 Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed it in a move not recognised by the international community.
 This year, in addition to the deaths from the attack on Friday, at least 43 Palestinians -- including attackers, militants and civilians -- have been killed.
 Nine Israeli civilians, including three children, and one Ukrainian have been killed over the same period, according to an AFP tally based on official statements.
 Friday's attack followed a week of violence in the West Bank.
 On Thursday, Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian near the city of Hebron, the Palestinian health ministry said, after what the army called a "stabbing attack".
 On Tuesday, troops shot dead a Palestinian teenager in the city of Nablus, the health ministry said, with the Israeli military saying he had fired on soldiers.
 A day earlier, Israeli forces killed five suspected Palestinian gunmen in a raid in Jericho, after a days-long search for suspects in a shooting at a restaurant.
 In late January, a shooter killed six Israelis and a Ukrainian outside a synagogue in east Jerusalem, a day after the deadliest Israeli army raid in years in the occupied West Bank claimed 10 lives. 
 The synagogue attack on the Jewish Sabbath was the deadliest targeting Israeli civilians in more than a decade. AFP

Thousands rally in Israel for sixth week against judicial reforms

TEL AVIV Tens of thousands of Israelis rallied in central Tel Aviv on Saturday for a sixth straight week against controversial legal reforms being pushed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government.
 "Democracy!" protesters chanted to the beat of drums in the coastal city.
 Netanyahu returned to power, following elections in November, at the head of a coalition with extreme-right and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties.
 The proposed judicial reforms would allow Israel's Parliament to overrule any Supreme Court decision with a simple majority of 61 lawmakers in the 120-seat body, as well as boost political control over the system through which judges are appointed.
 A first reading of the Bill is slated for Monday. Leaders of the protest movement have called for a strike on the same day.
 The protests have become a weekly fixture on Saturday evenings since Netanyahu's new government -- dubbed the most right-wing in Israeli history -- took office in late December.
 Defying predictions that Monday's planned strike would result in fewer protesters taking to the streets, last week's crowds appeared to be larger than in previous weeks.
 While there were no official figures on the turnout, Israeli media reported around 50,000 demonstrators, with the liberal daily Haaretz reporting up to 75,000.
 Rallies were also held in other large cities, including outside the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem and in the northern port city of Haifa, Israeli media reported. 
 Protesters also called for Netanyahu, who is fighting corruption charges in court, to resign.
 He denies the charges against him of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.
 "Netanyahu's trial is the reason for everything," said medical worker Neta Keren-Tal. "He is trying in every way to weaken the judiciary to escape his trial."
 For the first time since the start of the protests in early January, several dozen demonstrators also gathered in Efrat, an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank.
 In Tel Aviv, a minute's silence was held for the three victims killed in a car-ramming attack on Friday in Ramot, a Jewish settlement neighbourhood of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. On Saturday, a Palestinian was shot dead during a clash with Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank. The deaths add to spiralling violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict this year that has triggered mounting international concern. AFP

In Gaza, air strikes hit what the military described as an underground Hamas rocket foundry. The military called this a response to a cross-border rocket launch last Saturday.

Nikki Haley's presidential bid: 5 things about the Republican

Body


WASHINGTON - Ms Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the UN who entered the presidential race on Tuesday, has long been seen as a rising Republican star: Someone who broke the party's white, male mould and could walk fine political lines, rejecting some right-wing extremes without alienating too many base voters. That image is about to be put to the test.
 Here are five things to know about the 51-year-old, including bits of her political history that are likely to be raised in the coming campaign.
 1 
 From the moment she was elected governor in 2010, Ms Haley drew attention as a woman in a party dominated by men, a daughter of Indian immigrants in a party dominated by white people and a member of Generation X in a party dominated by boomers and the Silent Generation.
 She was the first woman and first person of colour to lead South Carolina --  and went on to become the first Indian American in a presidential Cabinet.
 She spoke openly about how her gender and ethnicity had shaped her. A notable moment came in 2015, when she explained her decision to call for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina Capitol after a massacre by a white supremacist at an African-American church in Charleston.
 She recalled how she had felt as a child when her father was racially profiled: Two police officers showed up at a produce stand and watched him until he paid. "That produce stand is still there, and every time I drive by it, I still feel that pain," she said. "I realised that that Confederate flag was the same pain that so many people were feeling."
 Yet she has used her platform and identity to argue that the United States is not systemically racist. America is not a racist country," she said at the Republican National Convention in 2020. "This is personal for me. I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants. They came to America and settled in a small Southern town. My father wore a turban. My mother wore a sari. I was a brown girl in a black-and-white world. We faced discrimination and hardship. But my parents never gave in to grievance and hate."
 2 
 Ms Haley was initially elected governor by a narrow margin for a state as staunchly Republican as South Carolina: 51 per cent to 47 per cent for her Democratic opponent. She more than tripled that margin  in 2014.
 In her first year in office, she signed a Bill cracking down on illegal immigration, including by establishing a new law enforcement unit and requiring police officers to check the immigration status of people they stopped or arrested if they suspected they might be in the country illegally.
 In 2014, she signed a Bill that redistributed education funding to districts with the highest poverty levels and provided money for reading coaches in schools. 
 3 
 In 2015, three weeks after a white man killed nine black parishioners at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, Ms Haley signed a Bill to remove the Confederate battle flag -- the emblem of the South's fight to preserve slavery -- from the South Carolina House. It was lowered the next day, and her national profile soared.
 "We are not going to allow this symbol to divide us any longer," she said. "The fact that people are choosing to use it as a sign of hate is something we cannot stand. The fact that it causes pain to so many is enough to move it from the Capitol grounds. It is, after all, a Capitol that belongs to all of us."
 4 
 After then President Donald Trump chose her as his ambassador to the United Nations, Ms Haley was confirmed overwhelmingly by the Senate, 96-4. She would serve for about two years before resigning at the end of 2018.
 At the UN, she was a face of the Trump administration's policies on Israel, North Korea, Russia and Syria. She accused the UN of "bullying" Israel for its treatment of Palestinians and called for the US to move its Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. She supported sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear programme and pushed  for the decertification of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran.
 But she was not always aligned with the president she served. In one tense episode, she said the Trump administration would impose sanctions on Russia over its support for a Syrian government that was using chemical weapons against civilians -- only for the White House to announce it would not do so, suggesting she had been confused. "I don't get confused," she responded tersely.
 5 
 Ms Haley denounced Mr Trump during the 2016 Republican primary race, describing him as "everything I taught my children not to do in kindergarten". 
 Then Mr Trump got elected, and Ms Haley changed her tune. She served in his administration while staying restrained in her comments --  saying that his election showed he had connected with American voters and that Republicans needed to adapt accordingly.
 And while she condemned his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and his incitement of the mob that attacked the Capitol,  she quickly pivoted to cast him as a victim once the House filed impeachment charges.
 In April 2021, she said she would not run for president in 2024 if Mr Trump did.
 Sometime between then and now, she changed her mind.  NYTIMES

Israel-Gaza border heats up after West Bank violence

GAZA  Gaza militants fired rockets and Israel carried out air strikes across the Israel-Gaza frontier on Thursday, a day after 11 Palestinians were killed during an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank, renewing concerns of broader escalation. 
 Mediation efforts were under way by Egypt and the United Nations to calm the situation, officials said.
 Israel's military said six rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip overnight, setting off air raid sirens in southern Israeli communities. Five rockets were intercepted by missile defences and the other fell in an open area. No injuries were reported.
 Palestinian militant faction Islamic Jihad stopped short of directly claiming responsibility for the rocket attack on Thursday, but said it had the right to defend against Israeli aggression.
 Israeli fighter jets later struck a weapons manufacturing site belonging to Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, said the Israeli military. No injuries were reported.
 The cross-border attacks followed an Israeli operation in the West Bank city of Nablus on Wednesday. Israeli troops killed 11 Palestinians, including at least four gunmen and four civilians, and wounded more than 100 people, Palestinian sources said. 
 UN Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland arrived in Gaza to meet Hamas leaders in an effort to calm the situation, a diplomatic source said.
 "I am continuing my engagement with all concerned parties to de-escalate the situation. I urge all sides to refrain from steps that could further enflame an already volatile situation," he said in a statement before the visit.
 A Palestinian official said leaders from Hamas and Islamic Jihad warned mediators, including Egypt, that the situation could slide into an "open confrontation" if there was no change.
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office declined to comment.
 It said in a separate statement that agreements had been reached with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads the pro-settler Religious Zionism party, that would grant him some civil powers in the West Bank, though it gave no details.
 In the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Palestinian groups went on strike as schools, universities and banks in all those places kept their doors closed.
 Mr Abdel-Latif Abdu, a vegetable seller in Gaza, shut his shop in support of residents of Nablus and the rest of the West Bank.
 "They (Israel) can't divide us. We are all one people and can't be divided," he said. 
 Nablus and nearby Jenin have been the focus of raids that Israel has intensified over the past year following a spate of lethal Palestinian street attacks in its cities.
 A total of 62 Palestinians, including gunmen and civilians, were killed in 2023, said the Palestinian Health Ministry. Ten Israelis and a Ukrainian tourist died in Palestinian attacks in the same period, according to Israel's Foreign Ministry. REUTERS

Jordan's King seeks US aid against border drug war

AMMAN Jordan's King Abdullah told United States Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday that a surge in West Bank violence threatened regional stability and asked for assistance to fight a growing drug war along its borders with Syria blamed on Iranian-backed militias, Jordanian officials said. 
 Mr Austin arrived in Jordan at the start of a Middle East tour that will also take him to Israel and Egypt in a show of support for its main regional allies against the growing threat posed by Iran, US officials said. 
 He wrote on Twitter before his departure that he would meet key leaders and "reaffirm the US commitment to regional stability and advancing the shared interests of our allies and partners".
 The King, whose country hosted the first Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Aqaba last week with the participation of top US and Egyptian officials, said efforts must be accelerated to bring about a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace deal based on a two-state solution.
 "There is a need for calm and to reduce escalation in Palestinian territories and stop any unilateral steps that undermine stability and abort chances of attaining peace," said a palace statement after the talks between the King and Mr Austin.
 In Israel, Mr Austin will also raise concerns about the violence in the West Bank that has alarmed Jordan and Arab leaders and discuss diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions ahead of Muslim and Jewish religious holidays, US officials said.
 The US Defence Department said ahead of the visit that discussions would focus on the growing threat Iran poses to regional stability, and on advancing multilateral security cooperation with integrated air and missile defences.
 "Those threats include Iran's arming, training and funding of violent proxy groups, aggression at sea, cyber threats, its ballistic missile programme and drone attacks," he added.
 The King discussed with Mr Austin Jordan's concerns over the growing entrenchment of Iranian-backed militias in southern Syria whom officials say have stepped up drug-smuggling operations through its borders to reach markets in the Gulf, a Jordanian official told Reuters.
 Amman wants more US military aid to bolster security on the border, where Washington has -- since the more than decade-long conflict began -- given around US$1 billion (S$1.34 billion) to establish border posts, Jordanian officials say.

The US is not an indispensable peacemaker

Byline: Trita Parsi, The US is not an indispensable peacemaker
Body


There was a time when all roads to peace went through Washington. From the 1978 Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt brokered by president Jimmy Carter, to the 1993 Oslo Accords signed on the White House lawn, to senator George Mitchell's Good Friday Agreement that ended the fighting in Northern Ireland in 1998, America was the indispensable nation for peacemaking. To Mr Paul Nitze, a long-time diplomat and Washington insider, "making evident its qualifications as an honest broker" was central to America's influence after the end of the Cold War.
 But over the years, as America's foreign policy became more militarised and as sustaining the so-called rules-based order increasingly meant that the United States put itself above all rules, America appears to have given up on the virtues of honest peacemaking.
 It deliberately chose a different path. America increasingly prides itself on not being an impartial mediator. It abhors neutrality. It strives to take sides in order to be "on the right side of history" since it views statecraft as a cosmic battle between good and evil rather than the pragmatic management of conflict where peace inevitably comes at the expense of some justice.
 This has perhaps been most evident in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but is now increasingly defining America's general posture. In 2000, when Dr Madeleine Albright defended the Clinton administration's refusal to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the excessive use of force against Palestinians, she cited the need for the United States to be seen as an "honest broker". But since then, the United States has vetoed 12 Security Council resolutions expressing criticisms of Israel -- so much for neutrality.
 America started to follow a different playbook. Today, its leaders mediate to help "our" side in a conflict advance our position rather than to establish a lasting peace. We do it to demonstrate the value of allying with the United States. While this trend is more than two decades long, it has reached full maturity now with great-power competition with China becoming the organising principle of US foreign policy. This rivalry is, in the words of Dr Colin Kahl, the Undersecretary of Defence for Policy, "not a competition of countries. It is a competition of coalitions". Following Dr Kahl's logic, we keep our coalition partners close by offering them -- in addition to military might -- our services as a "partial broker" to tilt the scales of diplomacy in their favour.
 Marvel movie logicIt is what you do when you see the world through the prism of a Marvel movie: Peace is born not out of compromise but out of total victory.
 But just as America has changed, so has the world. Elsewhere in the world, Marvel movie logic is seen for what it is: fairy tales where the simplicity of good versus evil leaves no space for compromise or coexistence. Few have the luxury of pretending to live in such fantasy worlds.
 So while America may have lost interest in peacemaking, the world has not. As the Ukraine crisis has shown, America has been immensely effective in mobilising the West but hopelessly clueless in inspiring the global south. While the Western nations wanted the United States to rally them to defend Ukraine, the global south was looking for leadership to bring peace to Ukraine -- of which the United States has offered little to none.
 But America not only has moved beyond peacemaking. It is also increasingly dismissive of other powers' efforts to mediate. Though the White House officially welcomed the Saudi-Iranian normalisation deal, it could not conceal its irritation at China's new-won role as a broker in the Middle East. And Beijing's earlier offer to mediate between Ukraine and Russia was quickly dismissed by Washington as a distraction, even though President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine welcomed it on the condition that Russian troops would withdraw from Ukrainian territory. As Dr Mark Hannah of the Eurasia Group Foundation recently pointed out, there is an inherent hypocrisy "in touting Ukraine's agency when it prosecutes war, but not when it pursues peace".
 Still, Mr Xi Jinping of China seems undeterred. He travelled to Moscow this week and also plans to speak directly to Mr Zelensky in what appears to be the preparation for an active mediation attempt to bring the war to an end.
 Shared responsibilityMr Xi succeeded in bringing Iran and Saudi Arabia together precisely because he was on neither's side. With stubborn discipline, Beijing maintained a neutral position on the two countries' squabbles and did not moralise their conflict or bother with whose side history would take. Nor did China bribe Iran and Saudi Arabia with security guarantees, arms deals or military bases, as all too often is our habit.
 Whether Mr Xi's formula will work to end Russia's war on Ukraine remains to be seen. But just as a more stable Middle East where the Saudis and Iranians are not at each other's throats benefits the United States, so too will any effort to get Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table.
 In a multipolar world, shared responsibility for security can be a virtue that reduces the burden on Americans without increasing threats to US interests. It is not security that we would give up, but the illusion that we are -- and have to be -- in control of developments far away. For too long, Americans have been told that if we do not dominate, the world will descend into chaos. In reality, as the Chinese mediation has shown, other powers are likely to step up to shoulder the burden of security and peacemaking.
 The greatest threat to America's own security and reputation is if it stands in the way of a world where others have a stake in peace, if it becomes a nation that does not just put diplomacy last but also dismisses those who seek to put diplomacy first.
 In tomorrow's world, we should not worry if some roads to peace go through Beijing, New Delhi or Brasilia. So long as all roads to war do not go through Washington. NYTIMES

Netanyahu agrees to delay reforms to judiciary

Byline: , Netanyahu agrees to delay reforms to judiciary

JERUSALEM  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late on Monday agreed to delay to April talks in Parliament over a controversial plan to overhaul the judiciary.
 A statement from the far-right party Jewish Power said the proposed law would be pushed to the next session of Parliament in order to "pass the reform through dialogue". Parliament will be in recess next week for the Passover holiday.
 Netanyahu's coalition plunged into chaos on Monday, after mass overnight protests over the sacking of his defence chief piled pressure on the government to halt its bitterly contested plans to overhaul the judiciary. 
 Netanyahu had been expected to make a televised statement on Monday morning announcing the plans he says are needed to restore balance to the system of government, but which critics see as a threat to democracy. Amid reports that his nationalist-religious coalition risked breaking apart, the statement was postponed while Netanyahu met heads of the parties. 
 Meanwhile, tens of thousands of protesters returned to the streets in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, many waving the blue and white Israeli flags that have become an emblem of the protests.
 "For the sake of the unity of the people of Israel, for the sake of responsibility, I call on you to stop the legislative process immediately," President Isaac Herzog said on Twitter. The warning by Mr Herzog, who is supposed to be above politics and whose function is largely ceremonial, underlined the alarm the divisions opened up by the proposals have caused. 
 It followed a dramatic night of protests in cities across Israel, with tens of thousands flooding the streets following Netanyahu's announcement that he had dismissed Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for opposing the plans.
 A day earlier, Mr Gallant had made a televised appeal for the government to halt its flagship overhaul of the judicial system, warning that the deep split it had opened up in Israeli society was affecting the military and threatening national security.
 With the army reinforcing units in the occupied West Bank after a year of unrelenting violence that has killed more than 250 Palestinian gunmen and civilians and over 40 Israelis, the removal of the defence minister fed accusations that the government was sacrificing the national interest for its own.
 During furious scenes in the Knesset early on Monday, opposition Members of Parliament attacked Mr Simcha Rothman, the committee chairman who has shepherded the Bill, with cries of "Shame! Shame!" and accusations comparing the Bill to militant Islamist groups that want the destruction of Israel. 
 "This is a hostile takeover of the State of Israel. No need for Hamas, no need for Hizbollah," one lawmaker was heard saying to Mr Rothman as the Constitution committee pressed on with a key part of the Bill which is due to be ratified this week. 
 "The law is balanced and good for Israel," Mr Rothman said.
 Three months after it took power as one of the most right-wing governments in the country's history, Mr Gallant's removal has plunged Netanyahu's national-religious coalition into crisis, during a deepening security emergency in the occupied West Bank.
 An opposition no-confidence motion was defeated, but in a sign of the tensions within the coalition, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who heads one of the hardline pro-settler parties in the coalition, called for the overhaul to go ahead. 
 "We must not stop the judiciary reform and must not surrender to anarchy," he tweeted.
 The shekel, which has seen big swings over recent weeks as the political turbulence played out, fell 0.7 per cent in early trading before recovering some ground as expectations grew that the legislation would be halted. 
 By late morning, shares in Tel Aviv were up around 2 per cent and the shekel had risen around 0.8 per cent.
 As opposition spread, the head of the Histadrut labour union, Mr Arnon Bar-David, called for a general strike if the proposals were not halted. 
 Take-offs from Ben Gurion airport were suspended, while Israel's main seaports and hospitals and medical services were set to strike. Branches of McDonald's were also closed as the protests extended across the economy. 
 "Bring back the country's sanity. If you don't announce in a news conference today that you changed your mind, we will go on strike," Mr Bar-David said. 
 The judicial overhaul, which would give the executive control over appointing judges to the Supreme Court and allow the government to override court rulings on the basis of a simple parliamentary majority, has drawn mass protests for weeks.
 While the government says the overhaul is needed to rein in activist judges and set a proper balance between the elected government and the judiciary, opponents see it as an undermining of legal checks and balances and a threat to Israel's democracy.
 Netanyahu, on trial for corruption charges that he denies, has so far vowed to continue with the project and a central part of the overhaul package, a Bill that would tighten political control over judicial appointments, is due to be ratified in Parliament this week.
 As well as drawing opposition from the business establishment, the project has caused alarm among Israel's allies. 
 The United States said that it was deeply concerned by Sunday's events and saw an urgent need for compromise, while repeating its calls to safeguard democratic values. REUTERS

Israel's reservists join protests, possibly turning political crisis into security crisis

The judicial overhaul plan of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, introduced in January, has thrown the country into its most severe domestic crisis since 1973. That crisis intensified on March 26, when Netanyahu fired the country's defence minister, who had -- less than 24 hours before -- called on the government to delay its plans to reform the judiciary.
 The plan has incited an unprecedented wave of controversy among Israelis, as hundreds of thousands of protesters have gathered for a 12th straight week across the country in opposition to the plan. Yet it is not simply the persistence and size of the protest that is evidence of the crisis. It is who is protesting.
 The demonstrations have brought together groups representing almost all sectors of Israeli society. But among protesters is a group of individuals rarely seen at anti-government protests over the country's almost 75-year history: Israeli Defence Forces reservists. They include former combat pilots, members of elite units and special forces, cyber-security forces and military intelligence, who announced they will not volunteer for reserve duty service if the legislation passes in the Knesset, Israel's Parliament.
 Further demonstrating the unprecedented aspect of the response by reservists: Among those protesting are members of Israeli Air Force Squadron 69. All but three of the 40 reservist pilots in the squadron announced that they would not conduct training exercises and would instead join anti-government protests, claiming they are not prepared to serve in what they say would be a "dictatorial regime".
 "We have no contract with a dictator. We would be happy to volunteer when the democracy is safeguarded," an open letter from the reservists said.
 The highly controversial judicial reform plan would significantly weaken the Israeli judiciary's oversight over the legislative and executive branches.
 The plan calls for near total control over future laws, constitutional amendments and judicial appointments to be concentrated in the hands of the governing coalition in the Knesset. Critics and protesters say the plan undermines the 75-year delicate balance between the three government branches, ends liberal democracy as they know it and pushes Israel towards autocratic rule.
 Despite the growing protests, Netanyahu has defiantly promised to push the reforms through the Knesset. As the country inches closer towards a constitutional showdown between the executive and legislative branches and the judicial branch, the presence of former members of elite military units in these protests is evidence that the crisis' implications extend far beyond the domestic political arena.
 Besides threatening to undermine the economy and deepen societal divides, it threatens to erode Israeli national security and provoke a constitutional crisis that could ensnare the military as well.
 'The people's army'Israel's military, known as the "IDF," has been described for decades as the "people's army". That is because young Israeli men and women, when they turn 18, are mandated by law to serve in the military. Men serve for two years and eight months and women for two years.
 Upon completion of their regular military service, men and women are assigned to the reserve forces. The reserves are designed to provide reinforcements during emergencies and maintain preparedness through routine training and security assignments. While the number of Israelis serving as reservists has decreased over the years due to cutbacks and people finding ways to be exempted, reserve military service has been an integral part of the national ethos and folklore.
 The threat to the government articulated by the protesting reservists is unprecedented. It represents a powerful step by former military and intelligence officials who pride themselves on their independence from politics and commitment to protocol.
 Nevertheless, the reservists' view is that there is an unwritten contract between those who serve and the state: They are willing to risk their lives to defend a liberal democratic Israel. But if Israel becomes a dictatorship, this contract is null and void.
 It is possible that other security services like the police or Shin Bet, the internal security service, will take similar actions to protest against the reforms. Depending on how long these protests last, the situation could unfold into an uncharted security crisis with high risks of domestic instability and, as Israeli President Isaac Herzog warned, civil strife.
 Defence of democracy -- or insubordination'Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant, addressing the situation on March 25, expressed deep concern that the heated political debate is infiltrating the rank and file of the IDF. And that, Mr Gallant said, may undermine and jeopardise Israel's security at a time when the country faces external threats from Iran, Palestinian terrorism and Lebanese Hizbollah.
 "The events taking place in Israeli society do not spare the Israel Defence Forces -- from all sides, feelings of anger, pain and disappointment arise, with an intensity I have never encountered before," Mr Gallant said.
 Mr Gallant called for an immediate halt in the judicial overhaul legislation process. Instead, he proposed a dialogue between the two sides in order to reach a broadly agreed reform.
 Now, he has been fired for his comments. As a veteran of the IDF, a former Israeli diplomat and a long-time analyst of Israel's security situation, I believe the crisis poses a profound question of where the line is between legal political activism in defence of democracy and insubordination.
 The bigger question is what will happen with the military if the legislation passes in the Knesset, but is then struck down by Israel's supreme court, the High Court of Justice. Should Netanyahu's government request that institutions like the IDF act in contradiction to decisions made by the High Court, it is unclear to which authority these institutions would adhere.
 For example: If the High Court rules that a Jewish outpost in the West Bank was built illegally and needs to be dismantled, yet the government orders the IDF not to do it, what will the IDF commanders on the ground do'
 This tension is starkly displayed by the reservists who are refusing to partake in their usual duties.
 In light of Mr Gallant's call to halt the legislation process, it is unclear whether the voting on the changes in the makeup of the Judges Selection Committee, scheduled for this week, will take place as planned.
 The reservists' active participation in the protests and their vocal opposition to the government's plan have clearly made an impact on the defence minister. But, at the same time, Mr Gallant came out strongly against insubordination. Undoubtedly, the coming days will be critical in determining the direction of Israeli democracy.

Keep sports and politics apart: Jokowi

JAKARTAIndonesia's President said on Tuesday that Israel's participation in football's Under-20 World Cup hosted by his country meant no change to its foreign policy, stressing amid domestic protests that sport and politics should not mix.
 Mr Joko Widodo confirmed he had sent Mr Erick Thohir, a Cabinet minister and former Inter Milan chairman who heads the country's football association (PSSI), to talk to world governing body Fifa, after the draw for the tournament was cancelled over opposition to Israel taking part.
 Jokowi, as the leader is popularly known, underlined Indonesia's support for Palestine and a two-state solution. He said Israel's qualification was secured in July 2022, long after his country won hosting rights.
 "I hereby guarantee Israel's participation has nothing to do with the consistency of our foreign policy position towards Palestine, because our support for Palestine is always strong and sturdy," he said in a livestreamed address. 
 "Do not mix matters of sports and politics."
 Indonesia has no formal diplomatic ties with Israel and protesters recently held marches in Jakarta demanding Israel be stopped from competing in the May 20 to June 11 event.
 Indonesia's population is predominantly Muslim and most practise a moderate version of Islam, though a rise in religious conservatism has crept into politics in recent years. 
 The PSSI on Sunday said the draw for the 24-team tournament, initially scheduled for Friday, had been cancelled after the Governor of the largely Hindu holiday island of Bali refused to host Israel's team.
 Mr Wayan Koster had urged the Ministry of Youth and Sports to "adopt a policy forbidding the Israeli team from competing in Bali" due to the conflict with the Palestinians, the media reported, citing his letter.
 His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Governor told the media on Monday he was following a "government stance". Israel's football association has been contacted for comment.
 Mr Widodo made no mention on Tuesday of what Mr Thohir would propose to Fifa.
 The cancellation raised fears the country might lose its hosting rights and plunge Indonesian football into isolation again. It was suspended from Fifa for a year until May 2016 due to government interference.
 Indonesia is also trying to rebuild its reputation after a stampede at a stadium in East Java in 2022 led to the deaths of 135 spectators, many crushed as they fled for exits after police fired tear gas into the crowd.
 Mr Muhadjir Effendy, the acting sports minister, on Tuesday told Parliament that a solution must be found and that hosting the tournament was crucial for Indonesian football. 
 "There are still possibilities," he said. "Fifa is very appreciative, understanding of what's happening in Indonesia.
 "We're trying some options, and the best one we're still hoping for is that the event still happens in Indonesia." REUTERS

Israel's democratic credentials face more tests ahead

Body


Israeli leaders like Mr Benjamin Netanyahu frequently trot out the specious claim that their country is the Middle East's only democracy. 
 And for decades, American politicians have reflexively amplified that claim without examination. Some, like former president Barack Obama, have gone further, to laud Israel as the region's only true democracy.
 Both assertions are easily disproved. The pedantic argument is that there are other democracies in the region, and two of them -- Turkey and Lebanon -- have been around longer than Israel has existed as a modern nation. 
 The more pertinent point may be that, notwithstanding Mr Obama's presidential plaudits, a state that reduces 20 per cent of its population to second-class status is not a true democracy.
 But events of the past few months have demonstrated that Israeli society, distinct from the Israeli state, has strong democratic credentials. 
 The massive rallies against Mr Netanyahu's plan to neuter the country's judicial system have been popular, peaceful and persistent. 
 And now it looks like they have been productive: In a prime-time address, Mr Netanyahu announced that he would pause his push for parliamentary approval of the legislation, saying: "I am not ready to divide the nation." 
 Mr Netanyahu's ultra-conservative coalition, elected in late December, has been seeking to rein in the Supreme Court, which has historically blocked right-wing goals, such as settlement-building in the occupied West Bank and exempting the ultra-Orthodox from military service. 
 The prime minister wants to make the judiciary more answerable to the executive, and is using his coalition's slender majority to ram through far-reaching legislation. 
 A law approved last week stipulates that only the Knesset and Cabinet can declare the prime minister unfit and remove him from office. (Mr Netanyahu, remember, is currently under trial for corruption.)
 Protests against these changes have swelled in recent weeks, drawing hundreds of thousands. Inevitably, the rallies have drawn comparisons with the Arab Spring protests of 2011, with the implication that Israelis are learning from, rather than setting an example for, others in the region.
 But democracy, as the Middle East has shown over and over again, is about more than elections and protests. It is also about institutions that push back against the autocratic ambitions of leaders. 
 Here, too, Israel has passed the tests: From civil society organisations to civil servants' unions, all manner of institutions have come out against Mr Netanyahu's plans. Israeli embassies and consulates were shut on Monday as the country's Foreign Service joined other government workers in a general strike. 
 Perhaps most remarkable of all, large sections of the military establishment have openly opposed the judicial "reforms".  
 This brings to mind the role played by the Tunisian military and civic bodies in sustaining the protests that brought down the dictatorship in 2011. 
 Israel's business community, less dependent on state patronage than its Arab counterparts, has been bolder in speaking out against any changes that weaken the independence of the country's judiciary. 
 Their argument that this would be bad for business has been echoed by international credit-rating organisations, which warn of a negative impact to the economy. 
 "Stronger fiscal and debt metrics may not be sufficient to offset weakening institutions if the content of the judicial reforms and the way they are passed point to such weakening," Moody's said in a report, adding that capital inflows to the technology sector, a critical part of the economy, could be especially vulnerable.
 Other tests will come -- of vigilance and stamina. 
 Even if the judicial overhaul is set aside for now, Mr Netanyahu will likely return to it, whether for reasons of self-preservation, to forestall judicial action on the corruption charges against him, or under pressure from the far-right elements of his governing coalition. 
 When that happens, the demonstrators and Israeli institutions will need to show that their ardour for an independent judiciary is undiminished. 
 But the ultimate test for any democracy is freedom for all citizens. Conspicuously absent from the demonstrations are the Palestinians, who have good reason to feel they have no dog in this particular fight. 
 Few of those Israeli individuals or institutions that are taking a stance against the judicial overhaul have protested against the injustices visited on the Palestinians.
 Until that changes, Israeli society will have no more claim to represent "true" democracy than the Israeli state. BLOOMBERG

LAUSANNE  Indonesia has been removed as host of the Under-20 World Cup, global governing body Fifa said on Wednesday.
 The decision to strip Indonesia of its right to stage the May 20-June 11 event was taken after its football federation (PSSI) said it had cancelled the draw, following the refusal of the governor of the largely Hindu island of Bali to host Israel's team.
 "Fifa has decided, due to the current circumstances, to remove Indonesia as the host of the Fifa U-20 World Cup 2023," said a statement from the governing body.
 "A new host will be announced as soon as possible, with the dates of the tournament currently remaining unchanged. Potential sanctions against the PSSI may also be decided at a later stage."
 Fifa added that the decision had been taken following a meeting between the world governing body's president Gianni Infantino and PSSI chairman Erick Thohir.
 PSSI officials did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. However, in a live interview with KompasTV less than 30 minutes before Fifa's announcement, PSSI executive committee member Arya Sinulingga said he was "very pessimistic" about the World Cup hosting issue.
 "If we make political requirements in sports, it'll always be like this. We will be exiled from the football ecosystem," he said.
 Earlier in March, protesters marched in the capital Jakarta waving Indonesian and Palestinian flags, and demanding Israel not be allowed to participate.
 Earlier this week, the PSSI said losing hosting rights would harm Indonesian football teams' chances of taking part in other Fifa tournaments, while the economic losses would amount to "trillions of rupiah".
 On Wednesday, the world football body said that it was committed to aiding the PSSI following a deadly stampede in October 2022 that led to the deaths of at least 125 spectators at a stadium in East Java.
 "Members of the Fifa team will continue to be present in Indonesia in the coming months and will provide the required assistance to the PSSI, under the leadership of president Thohir," Fifa said in the statement.
 "A new meeting between the Fifa president and the PSSI president for further discussions will be scheduled shortly."

Angry fans mourn ouster

JAKARTA  Indonesian players, fans and pundits reacted with anger and sadness on Thursday after Fifa stripped the host nation of the right to stage the Under-20 World Cup weeks before its kick off, following protests against Israel's participation.
 The humiliating incident came after two influential governors advocated banning Israel from the football competition.
 Indonesia and Israel do not have formal diplomatic relations, and support for the Palestinian cause in the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation runs high, fuelling local opposition to hosting the Israeli team.
 Fifa's decision to find a new host -- thereby striking out Indonesia's automatic qualifying spot -- puts the country's most popular sport back in the doldrums and facing another bout of isolation as it recovers from a 2022 stadium stampede that killed at least 125 people.
 Some of the nation's football prodigies took to social media with fury after losing the chance to play at what Fifa bills as the "tournament of tomorrow's superstars".
 "Energy, time, sweat and even blood we have put in but, in a moment, failed because of political reasons. Here's our big dream that you've destroyed," wrote 19-year-old striker Rabbani Tasnim.
 A video online showed players with heads bowed and their coach in tears after receiving the news late on Wednesday that Fifa would seek a new host.
 "We, the players, are now affected, not just us but all footballers," said 18-year-old striker Hokky Caraka.
 Head coach Shin Tae Yong said he was "heartbroken and tired" after preparing the team for more than three years for the showpiece.
 On Thursday morning, flower boards for the players popped up outside the Football Association's (PSSI) headquarters in Jakarta, including one that read "Do not give up on your dream".
 Indonesians also inundated the Instagram page of Central Java governor Ganjar Pranowo with negative comments after he opposed Israel's participation.
 Bali governor Wayan Koster had also joined the anti-Israel chorus and around a hundred conservative Muslim protesters held an anti-Israel rally in Jakarta in March.
 Mr Koster on Thursday cited the occupation of Palestinian lands and "threat and security" concerns for rejecting Israel's participation, comparing his call for a ban to Russia's exile from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
 The Democratic Party of Struggle, the powerful nationalist ruling party of President Joko Widodo and Mr Koster, in a statement expressed regret about the decision but said it had sought for Israel to play its games in "the nearest neighbouring country".
 But there was popular support for the tournament -- scheduled to be held from May 20 to June 11 -- to go ahead as planned with many viewing it as a source of national pride.
 Jakarta had pledged to guarantee Israel's participation despite its pro-Palestinian stance, but opposing voices became too loud for Fifa.
 "This is a very painful incident for the Indonesian people. Those who made the noise and made us fail... must be held accountable," said Akmal Marhali, an expert at football watchdog Save Our Soccer.
 Indonesian officials said losing the tournament could cost the country "trillions of rupiah".
 Fifa also threatened further sanctions for the protests and could exclude Indonesia from 2026 World Cup qualifiers that begin in October. 
 However, for Indonesia's fervent fans, it was the loss of their first-ever major football tournament that hurt the most.
 "I am very disappointed because it has been my dream to watch Indonesia hosting a global football event," said 40-year-old supporter Jarnawi.
 Pundit Justinus Lhaksana asked: "We are talking about youths who want to play football. They do not have any more interests. Why is this issue blindly mixed with political games'" 
 Fifa said the decision was taken following a meeting between its president Gianni Infantino and PSSI chairman Erick Thohir.
 "A new host will be announced as soon as possible... Potential sanctions against the PSSI may also be decided at a later stage," a statement read.
 President Widodo said he was "disappointed and sad" over the call, but added that it must be respected.
 "Don't waste your energy blaming one another. As a big nation, we have to look towards what's in front, not behind," he said, adding he had instructed Thohir to work on avoiding Fifa sanctions.  AFP, REUTERS

Loss of U-20 World Cup may not hurt Indonesian politicians in polls

JAKARTA  Mixing politics and sports has cost Indonesia the chance to host the Fifa Under-20 World Cup, putting the nation's reputation and credibility to hold future world-class sports competitions at risk, analysts say.
 Earlier in March, some conservative Muslims had protested against the participation of the Israeli national team, which had qualified for the first time to play in the youth football tournament that had been slated to take place from May 20 to June 1 in a number of Indonesian cities. 
 Indonesia, like many Muslim-majority nations, has never had diplomatic ties with Israel, and has long opposed its occupation of the Palestinian territory. 
 The protests gained traction, following support from Bali Governor I Wayan Koster and Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo, as well as other members of the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P). 
 Mr Koster reportedly sent a letter to the Youth and Sports Ministry to "adopt a policy forbidding the Israeli team from competing in Bali", which led Fifa to cancel the event.
 The objections appear odd, given that Bali is predominantly Hindu and PDI-P is widely seen as a liberal party which shuns sectarian politics.
 Officially, PDI-P stated that Israel's participation would compromise the party's ideological principles, rooted in the belief of party founder and former president Sukarno that Israel represents Western neocolonialism.
 The reason is more likely political, analysts say. 
 PDI-P is making calculated moves ahead of the general election in 2024. Analysts believe party chair Megawati Soekarnoputri wanted to test Mr Ganjar's loyalty, even as she faces growing pressure within the party and from its partners to endorse him as its choice of presidential candidate.
 "Loyalty is important for Megawati. Perhaps she still has reservations about whether Mr Ganjar will be truly loyal to the party. With his statement objecting to the World Cup, he is proving that he concurs with PDI-P's stance and continues to seek its guidance," political analyst Djayadi Hanan told The Straits Times.
 "If Ganjar does not object (to Israel playing in Indonesia), he might completely lose the chance to be nominated as presidential candidate," he said.
 Amid the controversy, world governing body of football Fifa on Wednesday ditched Indonesia as host "due to the current circumstances", without mentioning the Israel issue. 
 The revocation dealt a huge blow to the country's football fraternity that is still coming to terms with a violent stadium stampede in East Java last October that left 135 dead.
 Angry players and fans took to social media to air their frustrations. 
 Indonesia's U-20 national team striker Hokky Caraka said in a YouTube video: "You don't know how hard we worked, so please don't express your opinion recklessly, because we are the ones who suffer the consequences."
 Football analyst Anton Sanjoyo told The Straits Times: "These foul-mouthed politicians are simply making absurd statements. They stayed quiet about conflicts between Russia and Crimea, or China and Xinjiang, but made a big deal of this issue. Oh, just stop with the double standards."
 Mr Anton said the tournament had been a "windfall" for Indonesia to make history and showcase its young local talent and "come on to the radar" of international football clubs.
 "During such big matches, football scouts from various countries are always looking for young talent. Our young players have trained so hard. But now they might have lost the chance, thanks to stupid politics," he added.
 President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, said: "I know this decision has disappointed many people. I also feel that way, disappointed and sad. But let's not waste energy blaming each other."
 He said this a day after telling Indonesians not to mix politics with sports, while emphasising that Israel's participation would not lessen Jakarta's support for Palestinians.
 Football Association of Indonesia chair Erick Thohir was tasked by the President to persuade Fifa not to issue sanctions and close the door on Indonesia hosting other international events, but this could be a tall order.
 Sports commentator Weshley Hutagalung said Fifa had given Indonesia a second chance to hold the U-20 football event, even after the deadly stadium incident raised safety and security concerns.
 "My worry is that not only Fifa, but other world sporting organisers will also now think twice about considering Indonesia as host, particularly when there is Israel participation," he said. 
 "We have lost people's trust and confidence in us as a competent host that respects the values that sports are not bound by race or religion. What might be the most painful is that the international community may ostracise us altogether from sporting events," he added.
 Mr Ganjar faces a risk of losing the support of football fans and liberal voters who make up his base, but whether it will hurt his chances if he stands for election remains to be seen, analysts say.
 Football has little influence on how Indonesians vote at the ballot box, far less than the Israel-Palestine conflict, said Dr Djayadi.
 "If the Israel football team indeed comes to Indonesia and PDI-P is okay with it, this support can be utilised by the opponents of PDI-P against the party," he added.
 "Indonesian football is not a fundamental issue in electoral politics.
 "There could be negative sentiments towards the PDI-P, but they won't last long. The issue will be on the minds of the public for one month, 1 1/2  months, before they get busy with other things."
 Agreeing, Mr Weshley said: "Indonesians are forgetful and forgiving. We will just have to wait and see what other big issues may be stirred up closer to the election."

Cross-border fire in Gaza after Israeli police raid Al-Aqsa mosque

JERUSALEM  Israeli police entered Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound before dawn on Wednesday and clashed with worshippers, in what police said was a response to rioting that set off a furious reaction across the West Bank and cross-border strikes in Gaza. 
 The incident, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and on the eve of the Jewish Passover, came amid fears that tensions  in a year of escalating violence could be unleashed at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, where clashes in 2021 set off a 10-day war with Gaza.  
 Overnight, at least nine rockets were fired from Gaza, prompting air strikes from Israel, which struck what it said were Hamas training camps, setting off ground-shaking explosions. 
 Witnesses said Israeli tanks also shelled Hamas positions along the border fence in the southern part of the Gaza strip. 
 The Palestinian Red Crescent said 12 Palestinians sustained wounds from rubber-tipped bullets and beatings in clashes with Israeli police. It added that Israeli forces were preventing its medics from reaching the area.  
 "In the yard to the eastern part of the compound, the police fired tear gas and stun grenades. It was a scene that I can't describe," said Mr Fahmi Abbas, a worshipper at the mosque. "Then they stormed in and started beating everyone. They detained people and put the young men face down on the ground while they continued beating them." 
 Israeli police said in a statement that security units were forced to enter the compound after what it called masked agitators locked themselves inside the mosque with fireworks, sticks and stones. 
 "When the police entered, stones were thrown at them and fireworks were fired from inside the mosque by a large group of agitators," the statement said, adding that a police officer was wounded. 
 Thousands of worshippers have been spending the night in the mosque compound, amid fears of possible clashes with Jewish visitors to the site, which Jews revere as the Temple Mount.  
 Videos  on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed fireworks going off and police beating people inside the mosque.  
 Palestinian lawyer Firas al-Jibrini said police arrested about 500 people. 
 Jordan and Egypt, both involved in US-backed efforts to de-escalate tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, issued statements strongly condemning the incident, while Saudi Arabia, with whom Israel hopes to normalise ties, said Israel's "storming" of Al-Aqsa undermined peace efforts.  
 The Palestinian leadership condemned Israel's attacks on worshippers, which they described as a crime. 
 "We warn the occupation against crossing red lines at holy sites, which will lead to a big explosion," said Mr Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. 
 The Israeli military said a soldier was shot and wounded during clashes with Palestinians in the West Bank town of Beit Ummar.  
 Over the past year, Israeli forces have made thousands of arrests in the West Bank and killed more than 250 Palestinians, while more than 40 Israelis and three Ukrainians have died in Palestinian attacks.

Israel targets Hamas sites in Lebanon, Gaza after rocket attacks

Body


JERUSALEM/GAZA  Israel's military hit sites in Lebanon and Gaza early on Friday, in retaliation for rocket attacks it blamed on the Islamist group Hamas, as tensions following police raids on the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem this week threatened to spiral out of control. 
 Loud blasts rocked different areas of Gaza, as Israel said its jets hit targets including tunnels and weapons manufacturing sites of Hamas, which controls the blockaded southern coastal strip, as well as a heavy machine gun used for anti-aircraft fire.
 At about 4am (9am Singapore time), the military said it had also struck three Hamas infrastructure targets in southern Lebanon. Residents around the area of the Rashidiyeh refugee camp near the southern city of Tyre reported three loud blasts. 
 "We strongly condemn the blatant Zionist aggression against Lebanon in the vicinity of Tyre at dawn today," Hamas said.
 Two Lebanese security sources said the strike hit a small structure on farmland near the area from which the rockets had been launched earlier. 
 The strike appeared to have left a large crater in the farmland in the south, according to Reuters witnesses. 
 A member of Lebanon's Civil Defence at the scene on Friday morning said there were no casualties. 
 The strikes came in response to rocket attacks from Lebanon towards northern Israeli areas, which Israeli officials blamed on Hamas. 
 The military said 34 rockets were launched from Lebanon, of which 25 were intercepted by air defence systems, in the biggest such attack since 2006, when Israel fought a war with the heavily armed Hizbollah movement. 
 "Israel's response, tonight and later, will exact a significant price from our enemies," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, following a security Cabinet meeting. 
 As the Israeli jets struck in Gaza, salvoes of rockets were fired in response and sirens sounded in Israeli towns and cities in bordering areas. However, there were no reports of serious casualties and only one rocket hit a target, damaging a house in the southern town of Sderot.
 The cross-border strikes came amid an escalating confrontation over Israeli police raids at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which in 2023 coincides with the Jewish Passover holiday. 
 "We hold the Zionist occupation fully responsible for the grave escalation and the flagrant aggression against the Gaza Strip and for the consequences that will bring onto the region," Hamas said in a statement. 
 Although Israel blamed Hamas for Thursday's attack, which took place as Hamas head Ismail Haniyeh was visiting Lebanon, security experts said Hizbollah, the powerful Shi'ite group which helps Israel's main enemy Iran project its power across the region, must have given its permission. 
 "It's not Hizbollah shooting, but it's hard to believe that Hizbollah didn't know about it," Mr Tamir Hayman, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, said on Twitter.
 Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati issued a statement condemning any military operations from its territory that threatened stability, but there was no immediate comment from Hizbollah. 
 Earlier on Thursday, before the rockets were fired, senior Hizbollah official Hashem Safieddine said any infringement on Al-Aqsa "will inflame the entire region".
 Unifil, the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, said it had been in contact with the parties, and that both sides had said they did not seek war, but it added that the situation risked escalation and urged all parties to halt their actions. 
 An Israeli military spokesman said the Israeli operation was over for the moment. 
 "Nobody wants an escalation right now," he told reporters. "Quiet will be answered with quiet, at this stage I think, at least in the coming hours." 
 Palestinian factions in Lebanon, which have a presence in the refugee camps, have fired sporadically on Israel in the past. But the border has been largely quiet since the 2006 war with Hizbollah. 
 The US State Department condemned the launch of rockets from Lebanon and earlier strikes from Gaza and said Israel had the right to defend itself. 
 But it also expressed concern at the scenes in the Al-Aqsa mosque, where Israeli police were filmed beating worshippers during raids that officials said were to dislodge groups of young men who had barricaded themselves inside the mosque.
 The Al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem's Old City is Islam's third holiest site, where tens of thousands pray during Ramadan. 
 Known to Jews as Temple Mount, the location of the two biblical Jewish temples, it is also Judaism's most sacred site, although non-Muslims are not allowed to pray there.
 It has long been a flashpoint for tensions. Clashes there in 2021 helped to trigger a 10-day war between Israel and Gaza.
 There has been widespread anger among Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza over the police actions as well as condemnation from across the Arab world. 
 Late on Thursday, police said there were also disturbances in a number of Arab cities in Israel itself, including Umm el-Fahem, Sakhnin and Nazareth.
 The worsening security situation adds a further complication for Mr Netanyahu's religious-nationalist government, which has faced mass protests over its now-suspended plans to curb the powers of the Supreme Court.
 However, opposition leader Yair Lapid said the government could count on cross-party support and Mr Netanyahu said Israelis stood behind the security forces.
 "The internal debate in Israel will not prevent us from taking action against them wherever and whenever necessary. All of us, without exception, are united on this," Mr Netanyahu said. 
 In the aftermath of Thursday's rocket attack, television footage showed large plumes of smoke rising above the northern Israeli border town of Shlomi, with wrecked cars in the streets. Israel Airports Authority said it had closed the northern airports in Haifa and Rosh Pina.
 "I'm shaking, I'm in shock," Ms Liat Berkovitch Kravitz told Israel's Channel 12 news, speaking from a fortified room in her house in Shlomi. "I heard a boom; it was as if it exploded inside the room."
 The Israeli military said mortar shells were also fired across the border.
 Amid fears that the confrontation could spiral further, following a year of rising Israeli-Palestinian violence, the United Nations Security Council held a closed-door meeting to discuss the crisis. 
 "It's going to be important for everyone to do what they can to calm tensions," US Deputy UN Ambassador Robert Wood told reporters on the way to the meeting.
 Thursday's attack followed a number of rocket launches towards Israel from Gaza, most of which were intercepted. Israel responded to the launches with air strikes on sites linked to Hamas, which it holds responsible for any attacks from the blockaded coastal strip.
 Speaking from Gaza, Mr Mohammad Al-Braim, spokesman for the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees, praised the rocket strikes from Lebanon, which he linked to the Al-Aqsa incidents, but did not claim responsibility.
 He said "no Arab and no Muslim would keep silent while (Al-Aqsa) is being raided in such a savage and barbaric way without the enemy paying the price for its aggression". REUTERS

Tourist, 2 sisters killed in separate attacks in Israel

JERUSALEM  An Italian tourist was killed and five other tourists were wounded in a Tel Aviv car ramming attack on Friday that came hours after two Israeli sisters were killed in a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank. 
 The attacks, after a night of cross-border strikes in Gaza and Lebanon, added to heightened Israeli-Palestinian tensions following Israeli police raids in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque last week.
 The tensions threatened to spiral into a wider conflict overnight as Israel responded to a barrage of rockets by hitting targets linked to the Islamist group Hamas in Gaza and southern Lebanon, but the fighting entered a lull on Friday. 
 However, the two attacks underlined how volatile the situation remains after successive nights of trouble that have drawn worldwide alarm and calls for calm. 
 In the latest attack, a car ploughed into a group on a street near a popular bike and walking path on a Tel Aviv promenade. The driver was shot dead by a nearby police officer when he tried to pull a gun, police said. 
 An Israeli security source identified the assailant as an Israeli Arab from the town of Kafr Qassem.
 A Reuters video  showed a white car upside down on the grass in a park. Police cordoned off the area, which was brimming with emergency responders. 
 The Magen David Adom ambulance service said the victims were all foreign tourists. Italy's Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed that an Italian was killed and other Italians may have been among the wounded. 
 Earlier on Friday, two Israeli sisters, aged 20 and 16 with joint British nationality, were killed and their mother wounded in a shooting attack on their car near the Jewish settlement of Hamra in the Jordan Valley. 
 "Our enemies are putting us to the test again," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after visiting the site of the attack with Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. 
 As soldiers hunted for the gunman, Mr Netanyahu ordered border police reserves and additional military forces to be mobilised to confront the wave of attacks. 
 A US State Department spokesman said on Friday that the United States "strongly condemns today's terrorist attacks". "The horrific attacks today, in which three were killed and at least eight others wounded, affected citizens of Israel, Italy and the United Kingdom. The targeting of innocent civilians of any nationality is unconscionable." 
 No claim of responsibility was made for either of Friday's attacks, but Hamas, which controls the blockaded Gaza Strip, praised them and linked them to the tensions around Al-Aqsa mosque.
 Friday prayers passed without major incident and, apart from some stone-throwing, police said the situation had been quiet. 
 Twice last week, Israeli police raided the mosque, where hundreds of thousands of worshippers have been praying during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, to dislodge groups they said barricaded themselves with the aim of causing trouble.
 Footage of officers beating worshippers who confronted them aroused concern, even among Israel's allies, and prompted condemnation across the Arab world. 
 The site in Jerusalem's Old City, holy to both Muslims and Jews, who know it as Temple Mount, has been a longstanding flashpoint, notably over the issue of Jewish visitors defying a ban on non-Muslim prayer in the mosque compound. 
 Clashes there in 2021 helped set off a 10-day war between Israel and Hamas. The exchange of cross-border fire awakened memories of that conflict, but as the lull extended on Friday, neither side seemed keen to prolong the fighting. 
 "Nobody wants an escalation right now," an Israeli army spokesman said. "Quiet will be answered with quiet, at this stage I think, at least in the coming hours."
 One official with a Palestinian militant group told Reuters they were ready to keep the calm should Israel do the same, with the group having "made its point". 
 A Qatari official said Qatar was helping international efforts to de-escalate the situation.
 Even before the flare-up of the past few days, the West Bank has seen a surge of confrontations in the past several months, with frequent military raids and escalating settler violence amid a spate of attacks by Palestinians.
 Since the beginning of 2023, at least 18 Israelis and foreigners have been killed in attacks in Israel, around Jerusalem and in the West Bank. In the same period, Israeli forces have killed more than 80 Palestinians, most of them fighters in militant groups but some of them civilians. REUTERS

Israel calls up reservists after deadly attacks

JERUSALEM  Israel began calling up police and army reservists on Saturday after separate attacks killed three people, including an Italian tourist, in Tel Aviv and the occupied West Bank.
 Despite appeals for restraint, violence has surged since Israeli police clashed with Palestinians inside Jerusalem's flashpoint Al-Aqsa Mosque on Wednesday, with Israel bombarding Gaza and Lebanon in response to rocket fire by Palestinian militants.
 The unrest comes as the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan, Jewish Passover and Christian Easter coincide. It is the latest in escalating Israeli-Palestinian violence since the new government of veteran Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power last December, a coalition with extreme right and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties.
 The Italian was killed and seven other tourists wounded when an Israeli Arab ploughed a car into pedestrians on the Tel Aviv seafront on Friday evening. The car flipped over before the driver was shot dead, police and emergency services said.
 Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni named the dead tourist as 36-year-old Alessandro Parini.
 Police identified the driver as a 45-year-old from the Arab town of Kfar Kassem in central Israel.
 "The terrorist was neutralised," a spokesman told AFP. 
 Three of the injured were still in hospital on Saturday as passers-by left flowers and lit candles at the scene of the attack.
 Italian President Sergio Mattarella condemned a "despicable terrorist act". The Rome public prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into the attack.
 The United Nations' Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland tweeted: "There is no justification for acts of terrorism and they must be clearly condemned and rejected by all."
 Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, called the attack a "natural and legitimate response" to Israel's "aggression" in Al-Aqsa Mosque.
 Earlier on Friday, two British-Israeli sisters aged 16 and 20 were killed and their mother seriously wounded when their car was fired on in the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank.
 The army said it had launched a manhunt.
 After the Tel Aviv attack, Mr Netanyahu instructed the police to "mobilise all reserve border police units" and directed the army to "mobilise additional forces", his office said. 
 Police said four reserve battalions of border police would be deployed in city centres from Sunday.
 The Defence Ministry confirmed late on Saturday that it had mobilised soldiers to support the police and would tighten entry restrictions into Israel for Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, in particular workers.
 Earlier, an Israeli military post came under fire in a drive-by shooting in the northern West Bank town of Yabad, the army said, adding that soldiers returned fire and hit one person in the vehicle.
 Friday's attacks came after Israel launched air strikes and an artillery bombardment before dawn in response to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.
 It was the heaviest rocket fire from Lebanon since Israel fought a 34-day war with Iran-backed militant group Hizbollah in 2006, and the first time Israel has confirmed an attack on Lebanese territory since April 2022. 
 The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which patrols the area along the border, urged restraint, noting: "Both sides have said they do not want a war."
 On Friday evening, the army said it had shot down a drone that entered Israel's airspace from Lebanon. 
 Last Wednesday, Israeli riot police stormed the prayer hall of Al-Aqsa Mosque in a pre-dawn raid, aiming to dislodge "law-breaking youths and masked agitators" they said had barricaded themselves inside.
 Ramadan coincided with the Jewish Passover holiday in 2023, raising tensions with the tens of thousands of Palestinians who pray at Al-Aqsa during the Muslim fasting month.
 But on Sunday, Ramadan prayers and Jewish Passover visits at the mosque compound passed without incident.
 The upsurge of violence drew condemnation from the European Union and the United States. 
 A Qatari official said Doha was mediating between Israel and the Palestinians. 
 Qatar -- which has acted as a broker in previous understandings between Israel and Hamas -- "is working to de-escalate the situation on all sides", the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. AFP

Thousands join Israeli protests over judicial plans

TEL AVIV  Tens of thousands of Israelis joined protests on Saturday against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to tighten controls on the Supreme Court, despite heightened security worries after two deadly attacks a day earlier.
 The latest in a series of protests against the plans, which were paused in March in the face of a wave of strikes and mass demonstrations, comes as Israel faces a sharp rise in tensions on several fronts during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 
 A surge in violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was sparked by an Israeli police raid on Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem days ago. Israel has since struck targets in Gaza, Lebanon, and most recently, Syria in response to rocket fire mostly blamed on Palestinian militants.
 Israelis were also on edge after a car-ramming incident in Tel Aviv on Friday that killed an Italian man and wounded several other tourists, hours after a gun attack killed two Israeli sisters and wounded their mother near a settlement in the occupied West Bank. 
 Mr Netanyahu has mobilised border police reservists and ordered the army to reinforce security positions to head off possible trouble, amid calls for calm from the United Nations, the European Union and the United States.
 In central Tel Aviv, crowds waving the blue-and-white Israeli flags that have become a hallmark of the protests over the past three months gathered in a show of defiance against plans they see as an existential threat to Israeli democracy.
 The demonstration began with a prayer for the victims of the attacks a day earlier, but protesters said they would not be put off by security worries.
 "Security is one thing, but reform is another," said 26-year-old student Amitay Ginsberg. "We're still going to come here and say loud and clear that we will not let this reform pass."
 The proposals, which would give the government effective control over the appointment of Supreme Court judges and allow Parliament to overrule many decisions of the court, have caused one of the biggest domestic crises in Israel's recent history.
 Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, including army reservists, business leaders, members of Israel's technology industry and leading academics, have taken part in the protests, facing off against supporters of Mr Netanyahu's religious-nationalist coalition.
 The government side, which accuses activist judges of increasingly usurping the role of Parliament, says the overhaul is needed to restore a proper balance between the judiciary and elected politicians.
 Critics say it will remove some of the vital checks and balances underpinning a democratic state and hand unchecked power to the government. 
 Before the protests, police had urged people to leave roads clear to allow emergency services to move freely, following Friday's car-ramming on a popular shoreline promenade in Tel Aviv. REUTERS

S'pore deeply concerned over rising violence in Israel, Palestinian territories

Singapore condemns the rocket attacks on Israel and the separate attacks in Tel Aviv and Jordan Valley, which have resulted in civilian casualties. 
 "We remain deeply concerned about the escalation of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories," said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Monday. 
 It added: "We extend our deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and wish those injured a swift recovery." 
 MFA noted that there are currently no reports of Singaporeans affected by the attacks, and said Singaporeans in Israel should be on high alert and monitor the news closely. 
 "They should follow instructions from the local authorities and take the necessary precautions for their personal safety. Singaporeans travelling to Israel are strongly encouraged to e-register with MFA at eregister.mfa.gov.sg," it said.
 Dozens of rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel last Thursday, an attack the Israeli military blamed on Palestinian militants. 
 Hours later, Israel responded by striking Palestinian military targets in southern Lebanon and Gaza. 
 The exchange of fire came amid rising tensions over the storming of Al-Aqsa Mosque -- one of Islam's holiest sites -- in Jerusalem by Israeli troops last Wednesday and Thursday. 
 The troops fired stun grenades, attacked Palestinian worshippers and expelled them from the place as they gathered for Ramadan prayers. 
 Jews call the site Temple Mount, and it is Judaism's most sacred site.
 Last Friday, two British-Israeli sisters, aged 16 and 20, were killed in a shooting in the occupied West Bank. Their mother was seriously wounded. 
 The incident was described by the Israeli authorities as a "terror attack". 
 Later that evening, a group of tourists was hit by a vehicle in Tel Aviv. An Italian man died and seven others were injured. 
 MFA said Singapore urges all parties to exercise maximum restraint and de-escalate tension to prevent further loss of lives. 
 "All parties must respect the sanctity of religious sites such as Al-Aqsa Mosque to enable people to worship safely and in peace, particularly during the holy month of Ramadan."

Bali not rolling out welcome mat for Israeli athletes

BALI  An international beach sporting event may be the latest victim of Bali's hardline anti-Israel stance, after the governor of the Indonesian island made plain that he would not welcome Israeli teams.
 On Saturday, Bali's Governor Wayan Koster issued a statement saying teams representing Israel at the World Beach Games set to take place in August may not compete in the second instalment of the 14-event athletic competition.
 In March, international soccer body Fifa stripped Indonesia of its right to host the youth World Cup for male players under 20 that was to take place in May, owing to similar statements indicating that Israeli teams would not be welcome to compete on the island. 
 The Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC), which awarded the games to Indonesia in 2022, was expected to respond to the governor's statement soon, Ms Brighita Sesilya, spokesman for the Indonesian Olympic Committee, told The Straits Times. 
 "The president of the national Olympic committee of Indonesia, Raja Sapta Oktohari, will give an official statement after we get the letter from ANOC," Ms Brighita said.
 On Friday, Mr Raja met Mr Koster and the country's sports minister Dito Ariotedjo to iron out differences and ensure that the World Beach Games, which brings together 1,600 athletes from 130 countries, goes ahead.
 The triumvirate issued a statement that same day indicating that Mr Koster backed the games. The next day, the governor, who faces re-election in 2024, said his support hinged on the absence of any contingent from Israel.
 "My attitude remains consistent in rejecting the presence of Team Israel at the World Beach Games in Bali in 2023," the governor said in a written statement on Saturday.
 Mr Koster said his view was consistent with Indonesia's longstanding opposition to what it deems to be Israel's mistreatment of Palestinians.
 The World Beach Games in Bali "will run smoothly and successfully as long as they are held without the presence of the Israeli team, according to the agreement", the statement said. 
 Repeated efforts by ST to reach Mr Dito as well as Mr Raja for comment were unsuccessful.
 The 2023 World Beach Games will be the second iteration of the event, following its 2019 inaugural run in Qatar.
 The event is a rare opportunity for Indonesian athletes to compete with Olympic-calibre international athletes. Indonesian President Joko Widodo has stated publicly that he intends for his country to vie for the 2036 Summer Olympics. 
 Hosting sporting events makes a splash economically too, according to a report published in April by the University of Indonesia (UI).
 Ticket sales, hotel stays and money to spruce up stadiums and infrastructure in the six locations across Indonesia that were gearing up to host the Fifa youth tournament in May translated into a combined 4.4 trillion rupiah (S$395 million) fillip for those economies, which included those of Jakarta and Bali.
 Running from days to weeks, and appealing to audiences potentially in the tens of millions, sporting events pay dividends for the local authorities.
 The 2018 Asian Games opening ceremony in the Indonesian capital Jakarta drew a television audience of nearly 32 million. As many as 24 countries are expected to compete in May's Fifa youth World Cup.
 "Sporting events have a big multiplier effect, and they are a way of getting your city on the sporting map," Mr Yusuf Kurniawan, a UI researcher and co-author of the report, told ST.
 But with the exceptions of football and badminton, for all its 270 million-strong population, Indonesia punches well below its weight on the world sporting stage, having won a total of only eight gold Olympic medals -- all in badminton. 
 This makes it tough for the country to attract big sporting events.
 Indonesia's beach soccer team, which competed in Thailand in March, scarcely had a month to practise after the Football Association of Indonesia found funding to send a contingent. 
 The team lost all six of their matches, placing dead last in 16th place, three spots behind landlocked Afghanistan.
 "We don't get much support," Mr Ida Bayu Mahayasa, the team's coach, told ST. "We don't even have beach soccer leagues."

World champs Argentina to host U-20 World Cup

BUENOS AIRES Argentina will host the Under-20 World Cup from May 20-June 11, football's world governing body Fifa announced on Monday, after taking the tournament from Indonesia less than two months before kick-off.
 Having been awarded hosting rights, Argentina will also participate in Indonesia's place. The South Americans had failed to qualify on merit. 
 "Fifa is delighted to announce that this year's edition of the Fifa Under-20 World Cup will take place in Argentina, as the home of the world champions opens its doors to tomorrow's superstars..." Fifa president Gianni Infantino said in a statement.
 "I would like to thank the AFA (Argentine Football Association), its president Claudio Tapia, as well as the governmental authorities for their commitment to hosting this magnificent event at such short notice.
 "Having this year's edition taking place in a country that lives and breathes football will be a tremendous inspiration for the stars of tomorrow."
 Fifa withdrew hosting rights from Indonesia in March after protests against Israel's participation in the tournament. 
 Indonesia and Israel do not have formal diplomatic relations and support for the Palestinian cause in the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation runs high.
 Wayan Koster, the governor of Bali, had refused to host the Israelis, while protesters marched in the capital Jakarta waving Indonesian and Palestinian flags, demanding that Israel should not be allowed to participate.
 Fifa barred Indonesia from hosting the Under-20 World Cup as a result, which caused anger and dismay among fans and players in the football-mad country. Last week, Fifa also froze the development fund allocated for Indonesia's football association.
 The body added it "provisionally recommended a restriction on" the use of Fifa Forward funds for the South-east Asian country and would reconsider lifting the sanction only after reviewing Indonesia's plan to improve on Indonesian football.
 PSSI (Football Association of Indonesia) chief Erick Thohir said in a statement that the "administrative sanction" would impact PSSI's "operational needs" but did not give further details, reiterating President Joko Widodo's instruction for him to transform the sport, which includes renovating more than 20 stadiums.
 "Indonesia could avoid the severe penalty of being exiled from world soccer," he said. "This is more like a yellow card, not a red card."
 Argentina put itself forward as an alternative host after all the controversy, and Fifa made its decision after conducting an on-site inspection of facilities last week.
 The draw for the tournament will take place on Friday in Zurich.
 Hours before Monday's Fifa announcement, the Argentinian government expressed its full backing for the hosting bid by the AFA. 
 This despite the country facing deep economic woes, with tens of billions in International Monetary Fund debt and year-on-year inflation exceeding 100 per cent. 
 World champions Argentina have won the most Under-20 World Cups -- six in total. 
 The Argentinians are also seeking to jointly host the World Cup Finals in 2030 with Uruguay, Chile and Paraguay. AFP, REUTERS

Debate not whether the US or China is right, but what is right for Singapore

Good conversations often happen in transit, and one memorable chat took place on an MTR train ride in Hong Kong some 10 years ago.
 While headed back together into the city centre from a work event, a local journalist asked me: "Singapore is a largely Chinese society, so why doesn't it side with China more -- against countries like America'"
 It was a question asked in all earnestness and sincerity. The journalist, who was China-born and later moved to Hong Kong, was genuinely befuddled at how Singapore charts its own path in world affairs. I look Chinese, just like him. And so do most Singaporeans. So why do we not think and act "more like China"'
 Singapore -- the only country outside Greater China to have an ethnic Chinese majority -- appeared to him an anomaly for how it seemed to resist the pull of genealogical relations in the global arena.
 I answered the best I could. Singapore does have natural ties -- familial, language, cultural -- with China, which enhance mutual understanding, and it is a good friend of China's. 
 But its own interests must be paramount. I touched lightly on Singapore's sovereignty, its multiracial fabric, its geographical locale in South-east Asia.
 I got off the train at Admiralty station, certain that my acquaintance understood the intellectual arguments but less sure that they could overcome his emotional instinct that Singapore, with its ethnic Chinese majority, should be naturally more sympathetic to the motherland of their ancestors, whatever the merits of the case.
 In the years since, I have returned to that conversation often. It and some others that follow in a similar vein are a constant reminder of how questions of identity can remain fraught in Singapore -- and be even heightened in today's world. 
 A troubled global situationThat casual exchange a decade ago took place at a time when regional tensions over the South China Sea were escalating. Asean nations including Singapore, which is not a claimant to the disputed territories but has a vested interest in the free flow of maritime trade, called for a code of conduct to prevent and manage conflicts. There were also differences with China over whether it should deal with each Asean claimant individually or as a bloc.
 Today, there are yet more ructions across the globe. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Wednesday spent a substantial portion of his parliamentary speech during the debate on the President's Address sketching out the lay of the land.
 "The current global situation, both strategic and economic, is graver than we have experienced for a very long time," he said. He outlined three simultaneous crises: a war in Ukraine with no end in sight; the deepening hostility between the United States and China; and protectionism threatening the multilateral trading system -- the lifeblood of Singapore's economy. 
 These, he said, "will set in train a whole series of changes and shocks that will severely disrupt the world, our region, and surely Singapore". 
 Specifically, between the US and China, there is deep mutual suspicion and fundamental mistrust, said the Prime Minister. 
 Taiwan is a dangerous flashpoint, he noted. This Thursday -- April 27 -- marks three decades since the historic talks in Singapore between China and Taiwan that ended their deep freeze following the Chinese civil war. But the political chasm in the Taiwan Strait seems wider than ever. An alternative narrative is taking root in the West -- that the situation is not just about Taiwan, but a broader ideological issue of democracy versus autocracy. 
 "This is even though most countries, including most Western countries, have officially adopted one-China policies. This difference of views is very worrying," he said.
 And as actions and reactions play out, "the risks of a miscalculation or mishap are growing".
 Even if a direct conflict is avoided, "enduring enmity and bad relations between them will be very costly for both, and will mean big trouble for the rest of the world". 
 With countries taking sides, the free flow of trade and investments has become subject to quarrels. "Sometimes it is high-tech items like semiconductor chips or sophisticated machinery; sometimes it is agricultural products like bananas, barley or wine. They seek to inflict maximum political pain while blandly denying any hostile intent. It is a vicious cycle."
 For regular consumers, developments such as the US Congress' grilling of TikTok chief executive Chew Shou Zi and the Senate's move to ban the app reflect the widening ripples from the soured relationship. The latest flashpoint is Chinese fast fashion; the spotlight has now fallen on Singapore-based Chinese retailer Shein and online discount site Temu, for alleged data and business security risks, along with unfair market practices. 
 An insidious cankerWhat does all this mean for Singaporeans'
 Economy-wise, high inflation due to the Ukraine war will continue to eat at household budgets, while a fractured trade system will mean slower, uncertain growth, hurting businesses and workers. 
 These are painful challenges that politicians, policymakers and the public alike will have to grapple with, and for which there are no easy solutions.
 A more insidious canker will be the internal stresses that come from being yanked into the orbit of either superpower, with implications all round but especially for Singapore's foreign policy, national security and multiracial relations. 
 PM Lee said: "Tensions between China and the US will expose our population to emotional pulls, commercial pressures, and influence campaigns, from one side or the other, to take their point of view and support their cause." 
 Anecdotally, these run the gamut: from covert operations to privileged access for certain community and business leaders. There are also sustained efforts to shape the thinking of the populace -- whether as fresh content or selected news clips that support a certain framing -- most frequently, on social media and personal messaging platforms.
 The latter is often timed for effect: For instance, clips of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen being upbraided in December by an Irish politician for the European Union's hypocrisy in not condemning Israel's actions in Palestine as it did Russia's invasion of Ukraine quickly made the rounds in some quarters here during her visit to Beijing in April. She took a harder line on China, such as on its role in Ukraine and supposedly discriminatory business practices, than French President Emmanuel Macron, who was there at the same time. 
 In and of themselves, individual pieces of content may not be problematic or even inaccurate, but collectively, a certain narrative is being pushed out. 
 To some extent, China's influence campaign -- which is the more recent one -- is also an attempt to combat the prevailing Western-dominated perspective found in much of global media, popular culture and institutions. The most prominent of these in recent times are reportage on the developments leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as how China itself has at times been portrayed. 
 But the Chinese efforts are arguably more worrisome, especially in its potential ability to make headway with Chinese Singaporeans. 
 One misperception that China has about Singapore, writes veteran diplomat Tommy Koh in a 2016 article, is the "unreasonable expectations on the part of China towards Singapore. Many friends in China mistakenly perceive Singapore as a Chinese nation, describing us as 'kith and kin'". 
 This does not mean that all Chinese Singaporeans are susceptible to such an appeal, though a 2021 Pew survey found -- unsurprisingly -- that Chinese Singaporeans have a more favourable view of China than Malay and Indian Singaporeans.
 What is certain is that an avalanche of narratives on either side, when consumed exclusively, gives rise to binary thinking, when the world is anything but black and white. 
 And thus, too often, the arguments that emerge among Singaporeans -- over drinks, around dining tables, on WhatsApp group chats -- are often over whether China or the US is the virtuous party in their fight. 
 Rarely do people speak of what is right for Singapore. 
 And if Singaporeans do not understand their own country's position well, that is when its centre will not hold and the nation will be dangerously vulnerable to being pulled in all directions by external players. 
 What does it mean for Singapore's foreign policy to pursue an independent course? What does it mean when it says it wants to be friends with all major powers? Is Singapore a US ally, for giving the Americans -- as well as visiting forces from other countries -- military access to its air and naval bases? Or is it a Chinese ally, as its top foreign investor, its major partner in government-to-government projects in China, and a supporter of the Belt and Road Initiative'
 The truth is, as Prof Koh wrote, Singapore enjoys warm relations with both Washington and Beijing. And it must be in its interest that it does all of the above. 
 The danger is when we view our own actions through the lenses of players other than our own.

Self-radicalised Singaporean who planned to attack Jews released on restriction order

Body


 A self-radicalised Singaporean detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) in 2021 for planning a knife attack on Jews was released on a restriction order in March 2023, said the Internal Security Department (ISD) on Wednesday. 
 Amirull Ali, who was a 20-year-old full-time national serviceman in the Singapore Armed Forces when he was arrested in February 2021, had planned to target three Jewish men at the Maghain Aboth Synagogue in Waterloo Street.
 Amirull had also made plans to travel to Gaza to join the military wing of Palestine's ruling faction Hamas -- called the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades -- in its fight against Israel.
 He was detained in March 2021 under the ISA. 
 "Amirull has responded well to his rehabilitation, with the extensive support of the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG), as well as his family, who visited him weekly during his detention and was a source of constant encouragement," said ISD. 
 "Given the good progress he has made in his rehabilitation, Amirull was released on a restriction order in March 2023." 
 People under a restriction order must abide by several conditions and restrictions. 
 For example, the person may not change his or her residence or employment, or travel out of Singapore without official approval. He or she also cannot access the Internet or social media, or issue public statements or join organisations without the authorities' approval.
 As part of rehabilitation efforts, an RRG counsellor met him monthly, according to ISD.
 "The counsellor helped Amirull to improve his religious knowledge, and to embrace a pro-social understanding of Islamic principles," said the agency in a press statement.
 It added: "As a result, Amirull has renounced his radical beliefs in armed jihad and the use of violence. He now sees jihad as caring for his parents, improving himself and contributing to society.
 "He also understands the importance of living harmoniously with people of other races and religions in Singapore, and to verify any religious information that he is unsure about with locally accredited religious teachers and scholars."
 Besides religious counselling, Amirull also worked with ISD case officers and a psychologist. 
 "Through the interactions, he has come to understand that while one may sympathise with the plight of people caught in the crosshairs of a conflict such as that between Israel and Palestine, we should never resort to or advocate violence as a solution," said ISD. 
 It added that psychological counselling sessions also helped Amirull strengthen his critical thinking and emotion regulation skills, which will reduce his vulnerability to radical influences. 
 "His inability to critically evaluate information which he came across on the Israel-Palestine conflict, and his tendency to overreact emotionally to the plight of oppressed Muslims, had contributed to his radicalisation in the first place," said the agency. 
 While in detention, Amirull was given access to educational and self-improvement materials such as videos and articles and accompanying worksheets, following which he discussed what he learnt with the psychologist. 
 An RRG volunteer also provided him with weekly English lessons, as Amirull plans to pursue further studies at a post-secondary institution. 
 "ISD will continue to work with RRG and the Inter-Agency Aftercare Group to ease his reintegration into society," said the agency.

Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Israel agree on Gaza truce

GAZA/JERUSALEM  A truce between Israel and the militant Islamic Jihad group officially came into effect late on Saturday night, with an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire agreement meant to end the worst episode of cross-border fire since a 10-day war in 2021. 
 As fighting tapered off, streets in Gaza which had largely been deserted filled with Palestinians. 
 Some people cheered and honked car horns, while others headed to the homes of people killed in the fighting to show their respect.
 "In the light of the agreement of the Palestinian and the Israeli side, Egypt announces a ceasefire between the Palestinian and the Israeli side has been reached," a text of the agreement seen by Reuters read. 
 "The two sides will abide by the ceasefire which will include an end to targeting civilians, house demolition, an end to targeting individuals immediately when the ceasefire goes into effect," it said. 
 Israel's national security adviser thanked Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for Cairo's efforts, a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. 
 "Quiet will be met with quiet and if Israel will be attacked or threatened, it shall continue to do what it must in order to defend itself," said the statement.
 Islamic Jihad also confirmed the agreement. "We declare our acceptance of the Egyptian announcement, and we will abide by it as long as the occupation (Israel) abides by it," said the group's spokesman Dawoud Shehab.
 White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre welcomed the ceasefire on Saturday night, joining the Israeli government in acknowledging Mr Sisi's and Egypt's mediation efforts, and thanking Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. 
 Even as the truce was being finalised, the two sides kept up firing, with air raid sirens sounding as far as Tel Aviv's suburbs and Israel's military announcing it had hit Islamic Jihad targets in response to rocket fire.
 Though happy about news of the truce, some Gaza residents, weary of repeated flare-ups, feared that another round of fighting would erupt before long. 
 "We want the truce to be based on principles, not like in the past when after a calm (truce), people died," said resident Munir Marouf, 43. 
 Israel launched the latest round of air strikes in the early hours last Tuesday, announcing that it was targeting Islamic Jihad commanders who had planned attacks in Israel. In response, the Iranian-backed group fired more than 1,000 rockets, sending Israelis fleeing into bomb shelters. 
 During the five days of the campaign, Israel killed six senior Islamic Jihad commanders and destroyed a number of military installations. 
 At least 10 civilians, including women and children, were also killed in Gaza during the fighting and two people -- an Israeli woman and a Palestinian labourer -- were killed by Palestinian rocket fire in Israel. 
 Islamic Jihad spurns coexistence with Israel and preaches its destruction. Top ministers of Israel's religious nationalist government rule out any state sought by Palestinians in territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. REUTERS

DUBAI -- Nas Daily creator Nuseir Yassin has split up with his partner Alyne Tamir, better known online as Dear Alyne, after six years together. 
 The 31-year-old Palestinian- Israeli content creator, who has garnered millions of followers on social media with his one-minute daily videos, broke the news on Monday with an emotional video shared across Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.
 Together with his 32-year-old American-Israeli ex-girlfriend, he spoke about the reasons for the break-up in what he said was the longest video he had ever posted, at 13 minutes.
 "At some point, I stopped taking her on dates. I focused all my energy on the videos and my company, assuming the relationship was fine. But it wasn't fine," he said.
 He added that they "couldn't agree on many fundamental things", including whether to have kids or where to live.
 They moved to Singapore in 2019, but later relocated to Dubai.
 For her part, Tamir said, addressing Yassin: "I was not having my bids for attention responded to. I feel like you were going into your own world. And I was getting pushed out of that world."
 She said she did not feel like she was his priority, and they both said it was his focus on his work "that ended up destroying everything".
 However, they said they remain friends.
 Yassin said: "I'm happy you entered my life. I really, really feel happy that I got a chance to meet you."
 She added: "I'm happy that we learnt and grew and accomplished so much together. I'm happy it's finally time."
 The video also recapped their relationship -- their meeting online through messaging; their first date, which lasted four days; visiting 70 countries together; meeting presidents; fostering 50 cats; and even getting fake-married twice.
 Yassin addressed his followers in his caption: "You were with us during our lows and highs. You cheered for us. That's why you also deserve to know about the end of our relationship.
 "I hope this helps someone out there with their relationship. I hope they can avoid our mistakes before it's too late."

Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean met Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Monday during a working trip to the region.
 In his meetings, he reiterated Singapore's "longstanding and principled support for a negotiated two-state solution", which is consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, with Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace and security, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said on Tuesday. 
 The negotiated two-state solution would be the "only viable option to achieve a durable, just and comprehensive solution", the ministry added.
 As part of the trip, Mr Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security, called on President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, reaffirming the longstanding relations between the two countries.
 MFA said they agreed that the establishment of the Singapore Embassy in Tel Aviv in October 2022 would facilitate the deepening of collaboration in emerging areas such as artificial intelligence, agri-tech and digitalisation.
 Mr Teo also met senior Israeli officials to discuss bilateral relations and regional developments, the ministry said.
 On the same day, Mr Teo called on the Palestinian Authority's (PA) Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh in Ramallah.
 Both parties reaffirmed the warm ties between Singapore and the PA, and welcomed the establishment of the Singapore Representative Office in Ramallah in October 2022 to better coordinate capacity-building efforts.
 Mr Teo reiterated Singapore's continued support for PA's capacity-building efforts through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, including the Enhanced Technical Assistance Package for the Palestinians, said MFA.
 Mr Teo told Dr Shtayyeh that Singapore would be contributing US$50,000 (S$67,100) to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East's humanitarian relief efforts for civilians in Jenin, the ministry said.

A new Middle East in the making

DOHA, Qatar The Americans are talking to the Iranians, who are talking to the Saudis, who, in turn, are talking to the Israelis. Anyone who follows Middle Eastern affairs is likely to feel slightly bewildered by the sheer scale of current regional political activity. A region where rivals often refused to acknowledge one another's existence is now a hive of diplomatic activity where everyone talks to everyone. 
 At first sight, a positive development; no good can ever come from refusing to talk to one's neighbours, however objectionable one may consider them. And there is no doubt that, as a result, countries in the Middle East are exploring new and potentially radical approaches to some ancient problems. 
 Still, it remains to be seen whether the current diplomatic effort results in a fundamental change of direction for the Middle East or is merely a lull before a return to regional confrontations. 
 Iran's diplomatic overturesIran is the best regional example of the danger that peaceful moves now can still give way to major future crises. For years, the country was locked in a bitter confrontation with the United States and pro-Western governments in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia. For most of the region's states, no other country had the potential to be more disruptive than Iran, with its proxy armies such as Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Hizbollah in Lebanon and Syria, and the Houthis in Yemen, to name but a few.
 Yet, over the past few months, the Iranians have moved away from the language of confrontation. With China's mediation, they signed a deal to resume diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia; the two countries have just reopened their respective embassies in each other's capitals. And not a day goes by without another offer of peaceful cooperation from Iran; most recently, General Abbas Nilforoushan, one of the top commanders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, offered to share medical services with Iran's Arab neighbours.
 The Saudis, eager to extricate themselves from an unwinnable war in Yemen and other skirmishes elsewhere in the Middle East, have responded positively to Iran's diplomatic offers. But, as all the regional actors know, Iran's new cooperative mood is designed to win the country time as it approaches the moment of becoming a nuclear state. 
 The administration of US President Joe Biden has spent time trying to revive a nuclear deal with Iran that was initially negotiated in 2015 by President Barack Obama but repudiated in 2018 by the Trump administration. Washington's effort predictably failed; Iran and the US have had no contact since 2022. 
 The nuclear questionMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been multiplying the number and power of its centrifuges. Today, it produces uranium enriched up to 60 per cent, far beyond anything required for peaceful uses. It would take two weeks, or at most, up to a month, for Iran to reach the 90 per cent needed for weapons-grade uranium. 
 Historically, most countries aspiring to join the nuclear club have worked on producing fissile material and developing a delivery system in parallel and more or less at the same time. But Iran is an anomaly in this respect: It froze its nuclear weapon delivery programme two decades ago, and since then, it has concentrated almost entirely on the uranium enrichment objective.
 This raises the possibility that Iran may choose to remain a so-called "threshold" nuclear state, namely one that has mastered the entire uranium enrichment cycle but does not have a weapon. "To transform the bomb into a weapon and complete its adaptation to a nuclear warhead for a missile -- about two more years are needed," observes Israeli General Oren Setter, who has spent most of his professional life following Iran's nuclear development. 
 The Biden administration has vowed that it won't allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. But it does not wish to face a military confrontation at this stage, and certainly not before 2024's US presidential elections. Hence, Washington is eager to believe Iran may be content to remain just a nuclear threshold state. 
 Thus, in March, when the US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, faced a hearing before the US House of Representatives in Washington, he said the US "remains committed, in its policy, to ensuring that Iran does not have a fielded nuclear weapon", a fine distinction indicating that the US may well be content to live with a nuclear-capable Iran, provided it does not deploy a weapon.
 Indeed, secret negotiations are ongoing between the US and Iran through an intermediary for an agreement under which Iran agrees to freeze its nuclear programme while maintaining sufficient fissile material to manufacture one basic nuclear bomb and, in return, the US would free up around US$20 billion (S$26.4 billion) worth of Iranian assets currently frozen in foreign banks. 
 For the moment, it's hard to say whether Iran will accept such a deal. But as they make the last steps towards becoming a nuclear-capable state, it suits the Iranians to reassure their Arab neighbours. That is the main reason for all the current sweet-talking from Teheran.
 The snag is that this reassurance can only be temporary, even if Iran agrees not to deploy a nuclear weapon. Nobody in the Middle East believes Iran will remain a threshold state for many years without getting a delivery system. 
 In any case, ensuring that Iran respects a pledge to stay just a threshold nuclear state will be complicated. While there are plenty of technical means to detect a uranium enrichment programme, it's much harder to detect development in delivery systems.
 In short, while it is possible that, as it sits on the nuclear threshold, Iran now feels secure enough to engage more constructively with its Middle Eastern Arab neighbours, it is just as likely that the current cooperative mood from Iran will be short-lived.
 The Israeli exceptionBut while Iran is at least trying to make some helpful noises, Israel is the only Middle Eastern country bucking the trend by moving away from regional cooperation. Since it came to power in December 2022, the far-right coalition government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pursued two objectives: dismantling the country's judicial system and destroying the last vestiges of credibility of the Palestinian Authority, the political body representing Palestinians living in the occupied territories. 
 Mr Netanyahu claims to be the chief architect of the so-called Abraham Accords that normalised Israel's diplomatic relations with Gulf countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. However, the Israeli leader's policies in the occupied territories make it extremely difficult for Gulf states to conduct normal relations with Israel, and make it virtually impossible for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords. 
 Thus, when the opportunities for dialogue in the Middle East could not have been more enticing, the leader of the one state that has always complained about being isolated in its region is now contributing to his and his country's isolation.
 Until now, the wisdom in Israel was that while all Israeli leaders have had occasional differences with the US, no Israeli government can afford a prolonged confrontation with Washington. Prime Minister Netanyahu appears to be challenging even this last taboo in Israeli politics. 
 He has yet to receive his invitation to visit the White House, a stinging rebuke of a kind not administered against any other Israeli prime minister. Half of Mr Netanyahu's Cabinet was not invited to attend the US Independence Day celebrations at the US embassy in Jerusalem this year, yet another unprecedented American warning. 
 Yet, most of the ministers in Mr Netanyahu's Cabinet don't seem to care; they are seized by a messianic zeal to incorporate all the occupied Palestinian lands, and the belief that the Arab world needs Israel more than Israel needs the Arab world. 
 Saudi reformsBut probably the most noteworthy current development for the region is Saudi Arabia's renewed determination to reform its economic and political institutions. Observers outside the Middle East often dismiss Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as being too inexperienced, too impulsive, and often impetuous.
 But inside his kingdom -- the region's largest and wealthiest -- the 37-year-old Crown Prince is genuinely popular with his country's youthful population precisely because he is tackling Saudi Arabia's existential problems: an economic diversification away from dependence on oil revenues, and freeing the country's social and political life from the oppressive control of religious fundamentalists.
 Success is far from guaranteed; the history of the Middle East in general, and the Gulf in particular, is littered with previous reform plans that went nowhere. Still, in visiting the region, it is impossible not to be impressed by the strong undercurrents of Saudi change, from creating new holiday resorts and a new airline to attract tourists, to massive programmes to reskill the country's population. 
 Nor should one forget that political elites throughout the Gulf have realised that they have not more than two decades to wean themselves from oil and gas revenues before these commodities cease to be significant revenue-earners. The battle is no longer one of choice but of survival.
 In one way or another, all the countries of the Middle East are adjusting to a new regional architecture, one in which the US is no longer the predominant power, but other global powers -- such as Russia or China -- neither have the wherewithal nor inclination to replace the US.
 The new, rising Middle East may not be more peaceful. But it is becoming a region with at least a greater readiness to avoid direct conflict. And one in which alliances and cooperative arrangements are put together and dismantled at great speed.

A message from South-east Asia to the US

Body


What is the state of America's ties with South-east Asia? Can anything be improved on? An important assessment of that came earlier this month from a bipartisan group of US experts tasked to look at US-China relations.
 The report, Prioritising South-east Asia in American China Policy, sets out why the region is critically important but under-appreciated when it comes to US interests and US competition with China. It offers a set of policy recommendations for the United States government. 
 The Task Force on US-China Policy, co-chaired by academics Orville Schell and Susan Shirk, includes former government officials, scholars and think-tank researchers. 
 We hope that the report by the task force's working group on South-east Asia will be studied and given serious consideration by policymakers in the Biden administration, in the Republican Party and in Congress. 
 It raises important points about the US-South-east Asia relationship, key aspects of which we would like to highlight here: 
 US security and  economic rolesThe regional experts are of the view that the US security role is its most important asset. The US military is indeed welcomed by the countries of the region, and there are good ties between the US military and the defence ministries of the region. The US has helped to maintain a balance of power in the region.
 The region also appreciates the economic role of the US. The US has more investment in the region than China, Japan and South Korea combined. There are 6,200 US companies operating in the Asean countries. The US should do more in areas in which it enjoys a comparative advantage, such as financial services, information and communication technology, medicine and biotechnology, e-commerce, green economy, cyber security and the entertainment industry. 
 It is a great pity that then President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017, derailing what would have become the world's largest free trade deal while also advancing US strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific. 
 In May 2022, the Biden administration launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), in an apparent response to criticism that the US strategy towards Asia was "all guns and no butter". Over a dozen Asian countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and Australia, have signed on to the economic agreement.
 While the IPEF is relevant and forward-looking with its focus on improving supply chains, expanding clean energy and advancing digital trade, it falls short of a free trade agreement (FTA), which would give access to the US market.
 We agree with the task force's recommendation that the US should consider negotiating an FTA with Asean. An FTA would not only give Asean access to the US market, it would also give the US access to the Asean market. Asean has already concluded FTAs with many countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India.
 US soft powerSouth-east Asians used to admire US soft power. We admired the American political system and the smooth transition of power between presidents. We used to admire the fact that political leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties were able to work together for the national interest. We used to admire the fact that the US stood for free trade and open economies. We admired the fact that the US championed the rule of law. 
 But US soft power has suffered a serious blow since the advent of Trump. He was a president who refused to accept the outcome of a presidential election. The US political system is in disarray. The US has turned its back on free trade and globalisation. For these reasons, there is less admiration for the US from South-east Asians now than in the past. 
 However, the US still enjoys a reservoir of goodwill in the region. The US is not doing enough in its public diplomacy. Most people in the region are not aware of America's contributions to the region.
 Another way of building soft power is through education. America is the world's No. 1 education power. American universities, research institutions and think-tanks are among the best in the world. There are many more South-east Asian leaders who were educated in the US than in China or elsewhere. The US government should continue to welcome talented students from South-east Asia to study in America.
 The returned students comprise a constituency of friends of America.
 ChinaThe message from South-east Asia to America is that China is not our enemy or our adversary. We regard China as our friend and partner, and we do not wish to join any coalition against China. 
 To be sure, we have some problems with China, for example, in the South China Sea, in the Mekong River and in China's propensity to use trade and tourism as political weapons against countries which defy its wishes, as seen in its actions against South Korea and the Philippines. However, on balance, the positive aspects of our relationship with China outweigh the negative aspects.
 South-east Asians do not like the ideological campaign by the Biden administration against China. The campaign is framed as one that pits the US aided by democracies against autocracies such as China. But this strategy is flawed. Not all US allies and friends are democracies as defined by Washington, and not all democracies are willing to join the US in opposing China. Many democratic countries wish to be on good terms with both the US and China.
 Be serious about AseanAmericans need to understand that the countries and people of South-east Asia have a deep commitment to our regional organisation, Asean. It has helped to keep the peace in our region. It has spurred economic growth and economic integration. It has brought 10 disparate countries to form a community. It has brought all the countries that have a stake in South-east Asia to sit at the same table and iron out their differences peacefully. 
 We want America to take Asean more seriously and not to pay lip service to supporting Asean unity and Asean centrality. We would like to see some US initiatives to engage Asean as a group, and not only with some of its members.
 US policy on the Middle EastThe ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore carries out an annual survey of the opinion of the elites in the 10 Asean member states. When told to choose between the US and China, 61 per cent chose the US and 39 per cent chose China. However, the people in the three Muslim-majority countries, Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia, chose China over the US. Why? 
 They did that because of their anger with Israel's policies towards the Palestinians and because they perceive the US as pursuing a one-sided policy tilted in favour of Israel. The message here is that if the US wishes to win the hearts and minds of the 240 million Muslims who live in our region, it should pursue a more even-handed policy towards Israel and the Palestinians.
 US-China rivalry: Wrong lensThe final message from South-east Asia to America is to see the region and to deal with it on its own merit, and not through the prism of the US-China rivalry. 
 We are very pleased that this message has the support of the working group. In its report, the working group states: "...South-east Asia should be seen and respected on its own merits -- and not viewed solely through the prism of the Sino-American competition".
 The US-China competition is taking place in all regions of the world, including South-east Asia. South-east Asia is very important to both powers. America is the largest investor in the region. We are China's largest trading partner.
 We wish to be friends with both and do not wish to align with one against the other. Our request to the US is to deal with us on our own merit and not as a pawn to be used against China. 
 Tommy Koh and Daljit Singh are the editors of the book America: A Singapore Perspective, published in 2021.

US denies peace deal brokered between Saudi Arabia, Israel

Byline: Jonathan Eyal Global, US denies peace deal brokered between Saudi Arabia, Israel
Body


LONDON  United States officials have denied media speculation that they have successfully brokered a historic peace deal between Israel, its staunchest ally in the Middle East, and Saudi Arabia, the wealthiest and most influential state in the region.
 Reacting to a Wall Street Journal report on Aug 9  claiming that "the broad contours" of such a deal have already been decided, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the tentative diplomatic contacts between Israel and the Saudi kingdom still have "a long road to go, with an uncertain future".
 Mr John Kirby, who speaks for President Joe Biden's National Security Council, was even more explicit. "There is no agreed-to set of negotiations, and there's no agreed-to framework" between the Jewish state and Saudi Arabia, he told journalists. 
 Nonetheless, the Biden administration is investing much effort in brokering this deal.
 The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain established diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020, within the framework of the Abraham Accords signed through the mediation of the then Trump administration. Morocco followed suit in 2021.
 Saudi Arabia remained aloof from this process if only because, as custodian of Islam's holiest places, the Saudi King would not risk a deal with Israel that could be interpreted as a betrayal of the Palestine cause. 
 The Saudis have expressed their readiness to join the Abraham Accords. "Normalisation with Israel is in the interest of the region," said Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal Ben Farhan last month.
 The Americans hope that the normalisation of relations between the Saudis and Israel would boost regional economic cooperation.
 Mr Biden's team also believes that the conclusion of such a deal would cement a regional security structure capable of standing up to Iran.
 And then, there is a new twist to US calculations: Washington's anxiety about growing Chinese influence in the Middle East.
 One of the first foreign trips undertaken by Chinese President Xi Jinping after lifting Covid-19 pandemic restrictions at the end of last year was to Saudi Arabia.
 The Saudis view China as their best market for oil. In all Western markets, oil consumption is declining.
 More significantly, the Saudis have discovered that China could be a future helpful supplier of weapons, particularly of various missile systems that the US is currently reluctant to sell.
 The Americans are urging the Saudis to cool their interest in China. 
 Washington has promised to supply the Saudis with much more advanced weapon systems, provided a Saudi normalisation deal with Israel can be concluded.
 The Biden administration argues that it is in Saudi Arabia's interest to strike a deal with Israel while Mr Biden's Democrats remain in power in Washington.
 But in Congress, many Democrats oppose increased cooperation with the monarchy, criticising its alleged human rights abuses and the war the Saudis have been waging in neighbouring Yemen since 2015.
 If a deal with Israel is concluded -- Mr Biden's officials claim -- it would be much easier for Washington to get congressional approval for arms sales to the Saudis.
 The snag is that the Saudis are demanding a heavy price for their cooperation.
 Saudi Arabia wants a formal security guarantee from the US for normalising relations with Israel.
 It also wants the Israelis to promise progress in creating a Palestinian homeland.
 But the most significant sticking point is a Saudi demand for American help constructing its civilian nuclear programme, including uranium enrichment, on Saudi soil.
 "It is no secret that we are developing our national civilian nuclear programme, and we would much rather be able to count the US among the bidders," Foreign Minister Farhan recently said, warning -- in an apparent reference to the increased cooperation between Riyadh and Beijing -- that if the Americans are not forthcoming, "others could bid" to provide the kingdom with similar capabilities.
 Israel Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu would love to exchange ambassadors with the Saudis. That would deflect attention from his controversial domestic political measures, which have attracted widespread opposition.
 But Netanyahu's far-right governing coalition opposes creating a Palestinian state and is wary of Saudi Arabia's decision to acquire nuclear capabilities, even for peaceful purposes.
 Nor are many members of the US Congress persuaded.
 Critics point out that, even if a Saudi-Israel agreement is reached, the challenge of Iran will remain, and the burden on the US to confront it will continue unchanged. Three thousand additional US troops are arriving in the Middle East this week.
 And even security experts sympathetic to the Biden administration criticise the White House for seeking to provide Netanyahu with a treaty that may allow him to emerge from his current international isolation.
 Still, the White House seems determined to press ahead with brokering an agreement, even if the price that the US is asked to pay by both the Israelis and Saudis for such a deal is increasing daily.

Jokowi casts a long shadow over Indonesia
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 19, 2023 Saturday


Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte. Ltd. All Rights Reserved
Section: OPINION
Length: 1315 words
Byline: Leonard C. Sebastian, Jokowi casts a long shadow over Indonesia
Body


Mr Joko Widodo will leave office as one of the most significant presidents in Indonesia's post-independence history.
 Although Covid-19 temporarily derailed his agenda, Jokowi, as he is more popularly known, has pressed on with reforms and will abide by his constitutionally mandated two-term limit, putting to rest months of speculation that he intends to leverage his popularity to run for a third term. 
 How would one characterise his likely legacy for Indonesia? 
 A developmental strategyI think he made three main contributions during his term of office.
 First, he charted a development strategy suited to Indonesia's needs and laid the foundations for future growth. 
 Since 2014, Mr Widodo has opted to eschew the Western neo-liberal consensus and, instead, centralised state power to push through bureaucratic logjams. He coupled this with attracting foreign investments in strategic sectors. 
 He has employed the power of the state to speed up land acquisition for industrial development. He has also deployed state capital to support private investment and infrastructure financing through state-owned enterprise PT Sarana Multi Infrastrucktur. And he was unafraid of taking the controversial step of banning nickel ore exports to pressure producers to move up the stainless steel value chain.
 This enabled the accelerated development of sorely needed physical infrastructure, including the trans-Java highway and the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail, to boost intra- and inter-island connectivity and accelerate industrial development. 
 Moving boldly into uncharted territory, Mr Widodo decided to shift the country's capital away from Java to Borneo to create a new growth pole in the heart of the Indonesian archipelago, giving meaning to Indonesia Vision 2045 and perhaps impetus to the still yet-to-be-realised East Asean growth area concept. 
 These economic policies seem to be working. Future presidents know this and will likely continue this state-led and capital-intensive economic development model.
 A brand of moderate populismSecond, he developed a style of leadership based on moderate populism that reinforced the presidency's moral authority among the public and promoted inter-elite cohesion. 
 Mr Widodo exemplified a folksy and down-to-earth style that resonated with the Indonesian body politic and which will likely serve as a template for future democratic presidents seeking to build popular support. Ordinary Indonesians queue up to get a glimpse of the man when he visits their towns and villages.
 Furthermore, his ideological moderation and sense of balance, anchored on the Javanese notion of communality (rukun) and its emphasis on harmony and dislike for confrontation, alleviated elite competition and deepened a culture of cooperative government that will also likely survive past his term.
 After a bitterly fought 2019 presidential election with Mr Prabowo Subianto, Mr Widodo co-opted him as Defence Minister and earned opposition party Gerindra's support, which gave him a supermajority in Parliament.
 Given that Indonesia is a relatively young democracy, Mr Widodo's success in positioning himself as a unifying figure that both elites and ordinary Indonesians can rally around looks likely to establish patterns of political behaviour that will persist beyond his time in office.
 Putting Indonesia  on the world mapThird, Mr Widodo successfully put Indonesia on the world map and demonstrated its growing economic and geopolitical heft to the world. 
 This was aptly exhibited during Indonesia's successful Group of 20 (G-20) presidency which positioned Indonesia as an advocate for the developing world and led to the establishment of the G-20 pandemic fund and the Just Energy Transition Partnership. 
 Mr Widodo, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investments Luhut Pandjaitan and Minister of Investment Bahlil Lahadalia were critical negotiators playing a balancing role between the West and the rest.
 During Mr Widodo's term, Indonesia's stable economic growth and receptiveness to foreign investments led many major economies such as China, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and others to deepen and broaden economic cooperation with Indonesia. 
 This puts Indonesia in an enviable negotiating position and will give any future president leverage and influence in investment deal-making. 
 Between continuity  and change With Mr Widodo's centrality in Indonesian politics over his two terms and his high approval ratings just before the next general election, he has tremendous influence over the electoral fortunes of the three presidential aspirants.
 A central axis of competition in the upcoming poll will be contestation over whether "Jokowinomics" has benefited ordinary Indonesians. 
 While the government continues to receive high approval ratings, concerns about socio-economic issues such as the cost of living, employment, affordable housing, health, education, pollution and climate change look set to dominate discussions in the upcoming election. 
 To court the broad middle of Indonesia, candidates know people want to see the continuation of economic developmentalism and the emphasis of a moderate Muslim approach to public policy.
 All three potential presidential candidates have positioned themselves along this central axis. Both the governor of Central Java Ganjar Pranowo and Mr Prabowo are competing to position themselves as Mr Widodo's successor. 
 Across Indonesia, posters of both candidates are almost always placed side by side with the President's image, giving the impression that they have received his endorsement. 
 The sole opposition candidate Anies Baswedan, supported by the so-called "Coalition of Change", a group of three parties, is seeking to make the argument that Indonesia needs change. 
 Mr Anies is building a platform based on his past achievements as governor of Jakarta. He is seeking to promote quality economic growth for all Indonesians, an implicit criticism that "Jokowinomics" was too top-heavy and neglected ordinary Indonesians. 
 Influence over next electionLooking ahead, Mr Widodo will likely split his support equally between Mr Ganjar and Mr Prabowo. 
 He will likely avoid giving a formal endorsement of either unless Mr Anies' campaign gains traction. With Mr Anies currently a distant third in the opinion polls, Mr Widodo would rather let competition on the stumps between Mr Ganjar and Mr Prabowo play out. 
 Initially, Mr Ganjar appeared to be an early favourite. In a 2022 rally with his volunteer groups, Mr Widodo suggested that the best president for Indonesia was one who worked so hard to address the day-to-day issues of ordinary Indonesians that he had white hair (rambut putih) -- an allusion to the personable, white-haired Mr Ganjar. 
 However, everything changed after the Under-20 World Cup controversy. Indonesia's largest political party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), and Mr Ganjar pushed to ban the Israeli youth football team from participating, in support of the Palestinian cause, which eventually led to Fifa cancelling Indonesia's hosting rights. 
 Many fervent football fans in the country were triggered. Not only did Mr Ganjar's popularity plummet, the incident also forced Mr Widodo to re-evaluate his preference for the governor and seeded doubts over whether Mr Ganjar could function independently of PDI-P's control. 
 What was then a 60/40 support in favour of the governor became a 50/50 proposition as Mr Widodo now hedges between him and Mr Prabowo. 
 Given these circumstances, Mr Widodo is likely happy to sit back and refrain from taking a side, reserving his position on the best candidate for the top role.

Israeli intelligence will face reckoning after shock Hamas attack

Byline: Jonathan Eyal Global, Israeli intelligence will face reckoning after shock Hamas attack
Body


LONDON Fifty years almost to the day since Israel came under a surprise attack from Egypt and Syria, the Jewish state is yet again embroiled in a new and unexpected war.
 Just as in the October War of 1973, Israel's famed intelligence services did not see what was coming.
 And just as the fighting 50 years ago reshaped Israel and its region, the current pitched battles against fighters of Hamas, the extremist Palestinian organisation that infiltrated Israel in the early hours of Saturday, are destined to change the strategic map of the Middle East.
 Casualties among Israeli civilians are guaranteed to be very heavy, perhaps the most serious since Israel's war of independence in 1948. And a bigger Middle Eastern confrontation is now in the offing. The omens can hardly be grimmer.
 Since Israel's founding, the guiding principle of its defence strategy has been that, because the country is relatively small and most of its population live in a narrow strip on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, everything must be done to keep wars away from Israeli towns and villages.
 The strategy was remarkably successful. Even in 1973 -- the first time Arab forces succeeded in pushing back the Israeli military -- Israel's civilian population remained untouched by warfare.
 Hamas in Gaza on Israel's southern frontiers and the Hizbollah militias in Lebanon near Israel's northern borders have spent the past two decades extending their missile and drone capabilities to hit deep inside Israel precisely because they knew that Israel's weakest point was its civilian population.
 Until now, this effort had also failed; literally tens of thousands of missiles and projectiles were fired at Israel's cities, but a web of sophisticated defences -- including the various Iron Dome systems -- ensured that only a tiny number of Israeli civilians perished in such attacks.
 So, although in a country where all young men and women are expected to do national service and every family is affected by war, Israel's urban centres remained eerily calm and safe even in the worst security crises.
 All this changed this weekend as carnage came to Israel's streets. Hamas fighters penetrated no less than 14 Israeli settlements on Saturday, and for many hours roamed the streets largely unhindered, shooting people indiscriminately.
 Israeli social media is full of phone recordings of civilians desperately begging the military for rescue and video clips of civilians running for their lives.
 The operation to repel the Hamas fighters is far from over, and it may be days before they are all identified. Israeli military units will also have to deal with hostage situations where the use of overwhelming force against Hamas -- the favourite Israeli tactic -- makes no sense.
 It is impossible to overestimate the impact of this experience on the Israeli psyche and morale. For the first time, their country no longer looks invincible.
 And the shock will be even more significant when the total tally of casualties becomes known.
 There is also the problem of the captured Israelis now under Hamas control and probably hidden in tunnels in Gaza.
 Israel prides itself on sparing no effort to rescue its captured soldiers and civilians -- it even traded Palestinian prisoners in return for the remains of an Israeli soldier killed.
 But the sheer number of Israelis now captured by Hamas -- reputed to run into many scores and including some senior Israeli military officers -- means that the haggling over their fate could go on for years.
 Israelis are skilled at uniting when faced with a crisis. However, the moment the guns fall silent, an almighty political row will develop over how the country's intelligence agencies overlooked the preparations for this war.
 Heavy bulldozers operated by Hamas were pre-positioned to punch through the high fence separating Gaza from Israel, and hundreds of Hamas fighters were trained for months for this operation. Yet most Israeli troops remained deployed elsewhere rather than near Gaza.
 It is highly likely that, after restoring control over Israel's cities, the country's military will launch a ground offensive in Gaza, seeking to eliminate the Hamas leadership.
 And all eyes will be on Hizbollah in the north. If the Iranian-backed Palestinian organisation also moves against Israel, the Middle East will be consumed in an all-out war.
 Either way, it is difficult to see how Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, the country's already embattled Prime Minister, will survive this debacle.
 Current and future generations of Israeli civilians will have to get used to the idea that they can no longer be shielded from death and destruction.

Palestinian group Hamas launched the biggest attack on Israel in years on Saturday, killing at least 100 people and claiming it had taken dozens of Israelis hostage in an assault combining gunmen crossing into Israel and rockets fired from Gaza.
 Israel said the Iran-backed group had declared war and its army was fighting with militants in several towns. Navy forces also killed dozens of militants trying to infiltrate Israel by sea. 
 Israel's N12 News reported that at least 100 Israelis were killed, and multiple bodies were seen lying in the streets. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate, saying: "Our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known. We are in a war, and we will win it".
 Singapore was among countries that urged calm, adding it "strongly condemns the rocket and terror attacks from Gaza on Israel, which have resulted in deaths and injuries of many innocent civilians".

Muslim groups in Malaysia and Indonesia call for end to violence

Body


JAKARTA/KUALA LUMPUR Muslim groups in Malaysia and Indonesia have called for an end to the violence as the war between Israeli and Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip continued to escalate, with more than 1,200 people killed. 
 They have urged the United Nations Security Council to intervene, while some are organising solidarity gatherings in support of Palestine, saying that the root cause of the conflict is Israel's continued occupation of Palestinian territory.
 The UN Security Council met behind closed doors in an emergency session, but failed to achieve a unanimous decision needed for a joint statement.
 The leaders of both South-east Asian countries also issued statements condemning the war, which was sparked when Islamist militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israeli towns last Saturday.
 Israel retaliated by declaring a state of war, launching air strikes and ordering what its Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has called "a complete siege" of Gaza. It has mobilised some 300,000 reservists, a sign it could be planning a ground assault.
 Most of the Western world have condemned the Hamas attacks and expressed solidarity with Israel. Neither Malaysia nor Indonesia has diplomatic relations with Israel. 
 Malaysia's Foreign Ministry expressed deep concern on Sunday over "the loss of so many lives" in the latest escalation around the Gaza Strip, and urged all parties to exercise "utmost restraint and de-escalate".
 It said the root cause of the conflict was the "prolonged illegal occupation, blockade and sufferings, the desecration of the Al-Aqsa, as well as the politics of dispossession at the hands of Israel as the occupier".
 The Al-Aqsa Mosque, located in the heart of Jerusalem's Old City, is regarded as the third-holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina. 
 The heightened recent violence at the holy site has sparked wider awareness among Malaysians over the Israel-Palestine conflict.
 Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim expressed the nation's solidarity with Palestine, and accused the "international community of lopsided actions with regard to all kinds of brutality and oppression against Palestinians". 
 The opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS), the largest single party in Malaysia's Parliament, has told its rank and file to hold solidarity gatherings at mosques nationwide on Friday to "show PAS' stance and solidarity with the holy pursuit of Palestinians, especially in defending the Al-Aqsa Mosque".
 Indonesia's largest Muslim group Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), which has more than 50 million members, urged the cessation of conflict to prevent further civilian casualties. 
 Dr Ahmad Fahrur Rozi, the NU leader in charge of religious affairs, told The Straits Times on Monday: "We hope and call for Palestine and Israel to cease fire, negotiate and end violence under the supervision of the UN Security Council and the international community to achieve peace and justice for all parties. War will only cause prolonged suffering to the people. 
 "Israel must acknowledge Palestine's sovereignty in order to live side by side peacefully. The accumulation of violence against the Palestinians will continuously cause chaos and loss for all parties."
 He said that NU supported Palestine's independence by way of peaceful means and diplomatic negotiations. It will monitor the situation and adjust its measures such as fund raising and the distribution of humanitarian aid to Palestine in step with the Indonesian government's stance.
 In its official statement on Monday, NU called for Muslims and NU members to pray for the victims killed in the escalating violence, and for the establishment and justice. 
 Meanwhile, Indonesia's small Labour Party and the Confederation of Indonesian Trade Unions said they will stage a protest to be attended by hundreds of workers on Tuesday in Jakarta, where they will call for the end of war between Israel and Palestine, party president Said Iqbal said on Monday.
 Mr Sudarnoto Abdul Hakim, chairman of foreign affairs and international cooperation at the Indonesian Ulema Council, which is Indonesia's Muslim clerical body, said Hamas' attacks against Israel were reactions over "arbitrary actions" by the Israeli authorities carried out "within a long period and systematically", causing "the destruction of the sovereignty of the Palestinians". 
 He condemned Israel's retaliatory attacks, which damaged an Indonesian hospital in Gaza.  
 Indonesia's Foreign Ministry said on Sunday it was deeply concerned about the escalating conflict between Palestine and Israel. "Indonesia urges the immediate end of violence to avoid further human casualties," it said in a statement. "The root of the conflict is Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory that must be resolved in accordance with the parameters agreed upon by the United Nations."

Hamas' motivations behind assault on Israel

Almost 50 years ago to the day, Israel had failed to anticipate the outbreak of the 1973 Yom Kippur war -- a shock attack on its borders by a coalition of Arab states. 
 Now, it appears the country's intelligence apparatuses have fallen victim to a false sense of security once again.
 The belief, widely shared across Israeli society, that the Hamas militant group would avoid a large-scale military confrontation with Israel to protect itself and spare further suffering and harm to the residents of Gaza was shattered by a surprise assault on Saturday morning by air, land and sea.
 The attack began with a barrage of more than 2,000 rockets fired into Israel. Under the cover of the rockets, a large-scale, carefully coordinated, ground operation set out from Gaza and attacked more than 20 Israeli towns and army bases adjacent to the strip.
 Israeli losses are certain to increase in the coming hours and days.
 Israel's military reserves have commenced a massive mobilisation as aerial bombings of Hamas installations and command posts in Gaza are being carried out. 
 Calculations behind the attackAs in the case of the Yom Kippur war, numerous analyses and investigations will be undertaken in the coming weeks, months and years on the intelligence, operational and political failures that allowed the Hamas attack to unfold. The assault was apparently undetected by Israel initially, and then for hours met with either insufficient or unprepared Israeli forces.
 Similar to the 1973 war, the purposefully chosen timing of a Sabbath and the Jewish holiday of Sukkot provide initial, though very partial, clues to the breakdown.
 Hamas' strategic calculations in launching the attack are uncertain at this stage. However, the assured severity of Israel's retaliation against the group -- and as a consequence, the civilian population in Gaza -- makes it likely that considerations beyond just tit-for-tat revenge were at play.
 Kidnapping Israelis for prisoner swops with Hamas militants jailed in Israel, for instance, has been among the most highly desired objectives of the group's military operations in the past.
 In 2011, a single Israel soldier, Gilad Shalit, who had been held captive in Gaza since 2006, was exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Among these prisoners was Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' current leader in Gaza, who had served 22 years in an Israeli jail.
 The reports of dozens of Israelis being taken captive in the weekend assault -- many of them civilians -- suggest that this may have been a central motive behind the attack. An unknown number of hostages held for hours by Hamas militants in two Israeli southern towns were later freed by Israeli special forces.
 Another broader objective for Hamas may have been to undermine the ongoing negotiations between the United States and Saudi Arabia on an agreement to normalise relations between the kingdom and Israel.
 Thwarting these talks would be a significant boon for Iran, a key backer of Hamas, and its allies. While Teheran has said it supports the attacks by Hamas against Israel, it remains uncertain at this point whether Iran or Hezbollah -- the militant group in Lebanon that has a growing partnership with Hamas --would open additional fronts against Israel in the coming days.
 Any escalation in the conflict from either Iran or Lebanon would be highly problematic for Israel. The same would apply if the war with Hamas further exacerbates the already high tensions and violent clashes between Israel and Palestinian militant groups in the West Bank.
 What could happen next'Named Iron Swords, Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas in Gaza is likely to last a long time. The challenges it faces are massive.
 Along with the need to restore the trust of the Israeli public and resurrect Israel's smashed military deterrence against Hamas and other foes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government will likely have to deal with other complexities:
 International support for an aggressive operation could also become difficult to retain amid a mounting toll of civilian Palestinian casualties.
 The current round of violence has barely started, but it could end up being the bloodiest in decades -- perhaps since the war between Israel and the Palestinians in Lebanon during the 1980s.
 As noted, the Israelis will consider it critically important to reclaim their country's military deterrence capabilities against Hamas, which in the eyes of many, may necessitate a military takeover of Gaza. This would bring more devastating outcomes for Gaza's civilian population.
 For many Palestinians, last weekend's events offered Israelis a small taste of what their own lives have been like under decades of occupation. However, the early celebrations will likely soon turn into anger and frustration as the numbers of Palestinian civilian casualties will continue to rise. Violence begets violence.
 In the short and medium terms, the trauma of Hamas' surprise attack is bound to have momentous consequences for Israel's domestic politics.
 It's still too early to assess the likely many long-term impacts of the attack on Israelis and their sense of security. But one thing is clear: the already challenging prospects for the building of trust between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples have just suffered a devastating blow.
 In his 2022 memoir, Bibi: My Story, Mr Netanyahu wrote about his decision during Israel's Pillar of Defence operation against Hamas in 2012 to avoid an Israeli ground assault in Gaza.
 Such an attack, he warned, could lead to many hundreds of Israeli Defence Force casualties and many thousands of Palestinian casualties -- something he was adamantly against. He did authorise ground incursions on two other occasions (operations Cast Lead in 2008 and Protective Edge in 2014). But his cautious tendencies prevailed in other cases, at times, in the face of strong pressure.
 Arguably, the weekend's national trauma and the radical make-up of Mr Netanyahu's right-wing government will make it very difficult for him to show similar restraint in the coming days.

What Israel lost in the Hamas attack

Body


It is impossible to exaggerate the magnitude of the physical and emotional blow suffered by Israel as a result of last weekend's strikes inflicted by Hamas, the extremist Palestinian armed organisation in charge of the Gaza Strip.
 People outside the Middle East may blame both Israelis and Palestinians for repeated bouts of violence inflicted on each other. But for ordinary Israelis, the machinegun mowing down of hundreds of young people attending an open-air pop concert, the public desecration of the bodies of victims and the harrowing pictures of Israelis taken hostage -- including a very elderly lady who survived the Holocaust -- have shaken the country to the core. 
 And, like all such seminal events, the initial shock will turn to anger and a burning desire for revenge before the pain settles down to linger in the nation's collective memory for decades to come.
 It's also too soon to know or predict what lies ahead. A massive air and land-based Israeli offensive against Gaza -- one which would lead to the deaths of many Palestinians -- is already unfolding. Still, neither we nor perhaps even the leaders of Israel know how extensive the coming war will be, whether it will be fought on only one front or embroil neighbouring countries and paramilitary formations.
 But it is already crystal-clear that the weekend's tragedy has destroyed most of Israel's assumptions about the Jewish state's strategic position and its place in the region. From now on, the Middle East will be a different place. And at least for a while, the men of violence will dictate the pace of events.
 As a proportion of its population, the number of casualties suffered by Israel over the past few days is about six times greater than the death toll inflicted on the United States by Al-Qaeda terrorists during their 9/11 infamous attacks of 2001. Yet, in many crucial respects, the 9/11 comparison -- so favoured now by many media commentators -- fails to describe accurately the true extent of Israel's shock.
 The 9/11 attacks were completely unforeseen and unexpected; until Osama bin Laden and his associates dreamed it up, nobody thought of the possibility of ramming hijacked planes into skyscrapers to maximise civilian casualties. So, although the US intelligence services stood accused of ignoring leads that could have led them to the operation planners, they could hardly be blamed for not realising that New York's World Trade Center or the Pentagon were vulnerable targets.
 But the Hamas attacks on Israel over the weekend were an entirely predictable affair. Israeli military planners knew for decades that Hamas' main objective was not to confront Israel's armed forces but to hit at Israel's rear, at the country's population centres. That's why the Israelis have spent billions of dollars constructing a "smart" fence around Gaza, accompanied by a web of watchtowers and sophisticated underground electronic devices designed to detect any attempt by Hamas to tunnel under the border.
 However, Israel's intelligence services -- the same organisations that used to pride themselves on their ability to identify the house of every Hamas commander and kill him with diabolically clever devices such as poisonous pens or exploding mobile phones -- failed to pick up the preparations for the Hamas offensive. This amounts to a far more significant intelligence failure than the one suffered by the Americans in 2001.
 According to Israel's admission, more than 1,000 Hamas fighters poured into Israel early last Saturday, fanning out to Israel's towns and villages. How were these people trained and prepositioned by the border fence without the Israelis picking even a hint of such activity? How was the fancy wall easily breached by simple bulldozers, which were prepositioned by the border and yet unseen by Israel? And how come Israel's cameras and other electronic devices failed to raise the alarm last Saturday morning'
 These are some of the questions Israel's intelligence chief must now ponder. And as with all such intelligence failures, the cause they will identify will probably involve a failure to interpret disparate bits of information, coupled with what looks like some clever Hamas technical ability to jam or interfere with Israel's electronic detection systems.
 The political stormBe that as it may, there is little doubt that, ultimately, the chief responsibility for this debacle lies with Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and his Cabinet. This is a government in which the Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir -- the politician responsible for protecting the country's interior from precisely such attacks -- is a far-right extremist who advocates violence against Arabs and whose views and frame of mind were considered so objectionable that the military exempted him from doing national service. So, the Israeli politician currently responsible for national security is someone Israel's own military did not deem fit to be an ordinary soldier.
 More significantly, Mr Ben-Gvir spent the better part of 2023 goading, provoking and humiliating the Palestinians. He encouraged Jews to pray near Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-holiest site. He also promoted an expansion of illegal Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. 
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu busied himself with efforts to overhaul the judiciary which critics say are intended to weaken its ability to check the government and shield Mr Netanyahu, who is fighting corruption charges. The efforts to weaken the Supreme Court's oversight powers have led to massive demonstrations against his government, which have been going on uninterrupted for 40 weeks.
 Israelis have a tradition of drawing together when faced with danger. So, all the military reservists who only a week ago swore never to serve Mr Netanyahu's government have now reported for duty. And even Israel's noisy media has decided to suspend its criticism of the government.
 But all this is a lull before an almighty political storm. For in the inquiries that will inevitably follow the weekend's intelligence disaster, there is a high chance that, regardless of how much Mr Netanyahu and Mr Ben-Gvir succeed in shifting blame to others, the two and their entire government will be driven out of office.
 Under their watch, the border with Gaza was largely undefended because the bulk of the Israeli military was deployed in the West Bank to deal with rising violence there in recent months. And one contributory factor to the deadly surge of tit-for-tat violence -- attacks on Palestinian villagers by Jewish settlers emboldened by the Netanyahu government.
 What's lostFor Israelis, the Hamas assault at the weekend represents not only a tragic loss of life but also the end of a dream that was fundamental to their country's existence: the idea that, regardless of how many wars Israel fought, civilians inside the country could continue enjoying a peaceful, prosperous and Western-influenced lifestyle despite the tensions and bloodshed around them. That charmed existence -- the idea that one can spend a weekend partying in the open air near the border with Gaza on the assumption that the Israeli military remains invincible -- is now over.
 What's likely to follow? The desire for revenge against Hamas is strong and widely shared among the Israeli public. So is Prime Minister Netanyahu's intention of redeeming his reputation. But there is also an excellent strategic rationale why the Israeli offensive in Gaza will be massive, crushing in purpose and execution: the need to re-establish Israel's deterrence against Hamas. 
 The argument among Israeli military planners is that unless Hamas pays a hefty price for its latest attack on Israel, it will be encouraged to mount more in the future. The only way of deterring Hamas from doing so, they say, is by blowing the organisation to bits now.
 But the chances of Israel re-establishing its deterrence dominance over Hamas remains slim.
 Without a ground-based military operation inside Gaza -- a dangerous proposition of fighting in heavily built-up urban areas that will cost many Israeli lives -- any blows administered on Hamas will not be seen as substantial even if they are in practice; deterrence is as much about perception as it is about reality.
 And even if Hamas is decimated, the organisation has already achieved its objective. It is now considered the most successful Palestinian movement ever, the only one able to inflict a deadly blow deep inside Israel since the Jewish state's establishment 75 years ago. Nothing Israel does now can remove this Hamas achievement. Indeed, the more Gazans are killed by Israel in the coming offensive, the higher Hamas' standing.
 The Palestinian questionBut the lessons of last weekend's gruesome carnage go much further. For they represent the death of Israel's existing strategic concept -- shared not only by Mr Netanyahu but by all other Israeli prime ministers over the past half-century -- that the Palestinian problem can be marginalised, that the Palestinians have no other option but to live in the fenced-off bits of territory which the Israelis allocate to them -- while Israel gains peace and security by establishing diplomatic relations with its Arab neighbours.
 This concept drove the conclusion of the so-called Abraham Accords of 2020, normalising relations between Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates. And it was the same idea that, at least until last weekend, prompted the United States to encourage the establishment of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.
 The latest massacre is evidence that, whether the Israelis like it or not, the only path to a more stable Middle East is by addressing the plight of the Palestinians. Hamas is not an organisation Israel can talk to; it remains committed to the destruction of the state of Israel rather than any political dialogue. Yet by refusing to engage in substantive discussions with the more moderate Palestinian Authority, the Israelis have contributed to the rise of Hamas. And they will continue doing so if they persist in refusing to address the fate of the Palestinians.
 The Israelis argue that they have tried to give the Palestinians freedom before, only to see this result in greater violence. Israel ended its occupation of Gaza in 2005 and even forcefully evicted the Jewish settlers there, but the outcome was that Hamas turned the enclave into an outpost of violence.
 True, but not relevant to today's predicament. For Israel can no longer pick the settlement it wants; it merely has to keep trying any arrangement that reduces violence.
 The real tragedy from last weekend's Hamas attack is that the massacre in Israel has encouraged a feeling among its citizens that they can never live together with the Palestinians in one country. Yet, at the same time, it has also encouraged Israelis to believe they cannot afford to see an independent Palestinian state either. A more painful conundrum could hardly be invented.
 Sadly, therefore, the future belongs to more political deadlocks. And more violence.

S'pore couples in Israel recount day of Hamas' surprise attack

Body


 At about 8am last Saturday, the tranquillity of the morning at Mr Lim Keng Yeow's home in Arnona, Jerusalem, was shattered by the wail of an air raid siren.
 The 57-year-old and his wife, Madam Karen Phuah, ran down from their fourth-storey home into the air raid shelter in the basement, where they joined other residents in the same building in waiting for the danger to pass.
 The shelter, slightly smaller than a badminton court, is spartan --  three leather couches, a few plastic chairs, a handful of mattresses and a toilet provide a humble sanctuary.
 The vertical dash was one of five that the Singaporean couple had to make last Saturday as Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel. 
 More than 700 Israelis were killed, along with at least 1,200 wounded, after Hamas launched thousands of rockets from the Gaza Strip and infiltrated southern Israel.
 In return, Israel declared "a state of war" and launched retaliatory strikes, with at least 560 Palestinians killed so far.
 Back in the basement in Arnona, about 88km away from the conflict zone, the residents in Mr Lim's building brought food to share as they waited 10 minutes for the danger to pass each time the siren sounded.
 "In between sirens, I just find myself wanting to get more and more information," said Mr Lim, who has been in the city with Madam Phuah since Aug 22. "It is hard to do anything else." 
 Mr Lim and his wife are in Israel to pursue a degree at the Jerusalem University College.
 Mr Lim spoke to The Straits Times for 30 minutes on Monday afternoon (Singapore time), during which the call was punctuated with what sounded like explosions in the background.
 "I just got an alert that rockets and missiles were fired," he said, as he shared screenshots of alerts about rockets and missiles from the country's national emergency portal. The alerts came with the estimated time that the projectiles might hit certain parts of the country.
 "We are told to stay indoors so that we can be near a bomb shelter," said Mr Lim, adding that all his university classes had been cancelled on Monday, and he and his wife plan to stay in their flat. Classes will resume online on Tuesday.
 Madam Phuah said: "I am afraid of the danger as it really did not sink in till the declaration of war.
 "Having to actively be on the lookout for rocket and missile alerts, be wary of varied information and to take care of your own safety, all at the same time -- this is what being vigilant looks like to me now."
 She added that as a mother of two, it was painful for her to watch her landlady say farewell to her son and grandson before they left home to fight in the conflict as part of Israel's armed forces.
 Madam Phuah said she has found some comfort in a WhatsApp chat group with about eight other Singaporeans in Israel. 
 She said they have also been in close contact with Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 The couple's family members are worried about their safety. "Our loved ones at home are thinking of us and asking us when we will be coming back," Mr Lim said.
 The couple are exploring the option of flying home soon, although there is uncertainty about whether flights to Singapore will continue amid the conflict.
 While Mr Lim and Madam Phuah could be back in Singapore in the near future, Mr Kenny Lim, 47, and his family have no plans of moving back from Israel.
 Mr Kenny Lim, who lives in Israel with his wife and their five-month-old baby, said having experienced a strong sense of community in Jerusalem, he is confident that neighbours and strangers will come together to help one another.
 The clergyman said: "I have lived in Israel for 10 years, there is little that I have not seen.
 "But if the conflict were to come to Jerusalem, I know my family and I won't be alone in this. We have our own community... I have experienced it through my years here that Israelis are very helpful."
 He said he heard the first air raid siren go off at about 8am last Saturday, and quickly ushered his family into the bomb shelter -- about the size of 2 1/2  king-size beds -- inside their apartment.
 "We heard nine air raid sirens within two hours after we heard the first," he said.
 He added that he is "shocked and saddened" at the visuals he has seen online of women, children and the elderly being kidnapped and harmed.
 Mr Kenny Lim said: "Stories like that keep coming up, and it is really heartrending.
 "My heart goes out to those who suffered the loss, victims and the trauma they will go through."

Singdollar strength may ease by next year, say analysts

Byline: Kang Wan Chern Deputy, Singdollar strength may ease by next year, say analysts
Body


The Singapore dollar has trounced currencies like the ringgit, yen and Australian dollar while holding up well against a stronger euro and US dollar in 2023, enabling Singaporeans with extra cash to better afford school fees, holidays and shopping sprees overseas. 
 But those with plans to travel should expect to soon enjoy less for every Singapore dollar converted into foreign exchange and spent abroad, as the local currency could start to lose its resilience against major currencies by next year, analysts said. 
 Since October 2021, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has allowed the Singapore dollar to appreciate within an undisclosed policy band against a basket of its major trading partners' currencies. 
 This is done to cool inflation by guiding the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$Neer) higher within the band, allowing Singaporeans and domestic businesses to benefit from the increased buying power arising from a stronger local currency. Overall inflation in Singapore is now around 4 per cent. 
 Still, Singapore has lost steam with exports falling for an 11th straight month in August. The strong Singapore dollar makes locally produced goods more expensive for foreign buyers, implying that they are less likely to purchase goods made here. 
 With global demand declining, the local economy is forecast to grow at a much slower pace in 2023 compared with the year before. 
 Thus, analysts now reckon the S$Neer is trading at the upper range of the policy band. While the consensus is for MAS to keep its policy on hold to further keep inflation in check at its next meeting on Friday, more see a limited runway for the local currency to continue appreciating. 
 "We no longer see the S$Neer outperforming other currencies moving forward," said Mr Michael Wan, senior currency strategist at MUFG Bank. 
 "The next big move for the Singapore dollar will come if and when MAS signals a more dovish policy stance, which will lead to a weakening of the currency." 
 MUFG sees US$1 being equivalent to $1.32 in the next 12 months, strengthening considerably from $1.365 on Monday. 
 Meanwhile, investors have turned to the US dollar amid rising US Treasury yields, and are expected to continue buying the greenback as a safe haven currency following an escalating conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas, said Maybank Singapore head of FX research Saktiandi Supaat. 
 The Singapore dollar should also start to weaken against the euro next year as the euro zone recovers, he added. 
 The region has struggled as a result of cost pressures arising from a spike in oil prices in the wake of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, among other developments, and economic weakness arising from a trade slowdown with China. 
 "But markets have now priced in higher commodity prices from a protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Corporate risk-taking and investments should return, given that the euro zone is supported by its population size and well-diversified sector mix from agriculture and technology," Mr Saktiandi said. 
 Against that backdrop, Maybank sees strength returning to the euro and the Singapore dollar weakening against the currency from the middle of next year. On Monday, one euro traded for $1.44. 
 While the Singapore dollar should retain its strength against the Malaysian ringgit for the rest of the year, things are also expected to change in 2024. 
 "The ringgit is very sensitive to changes in the Federal Reserve's policy and has been weighed down by the high US dollar. Once the Fed starts to ease its rates, the ringgit should strengthen against the Singapore dollar," said Mr Saktiandi. 
 He expects the Fed to guide for lower rates from the second quarter of next year, once the US economy starts easing and as other countries begin seeing their currencies strengthen from improving economies. 
 Mr Saktiandi said the ringgit also moves in tandem with the Chinese renminbi, adding that the ringgit could also gain strength once China's central bank is able to stabilise the renminbi. 
 By the end of 2024, $1 is expected to be worth RM3.30 or less, according to Maybank. The exchange rate was $1 to RM3.46 on Monday. 
 While the Japanese yen has been among the weakest currencies against the Singapore dollar this year, this might not last for long. 
 Said MUFG's Mr Wan: "The yen will continue to be weak for the rest of the year, given that inflation in Japan is now at an attractive level and sectors like tourism are benefiting. So, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may not want to tighten its policy too soon."
 Still, a weak currency also implies that Japan could be importing inflation from its trade partners. 
 "As such, we see weakness in the yen continuing for the next three months but strengthening into 2024 as the BOJ tightens its policy and the rest of the world cuts rates," he said. 
 On Monday, $1 was worth around 108.9 yen.

Has Hamas violence wrecked Israel and Saudi Arabia rapprochement'

Byline: Carl Skadian, Has Hamas violence wrecked Israel and Saudi Arabia rapprochement'
Body


The latest upsurge of violence in the Middle East has put the brakes on prospects for the normalisation of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Saudi recognition of Israel would have been part of a series of shifts in the region that were prompted by larger trends which have now been delayed, but not reversed: In the affairs of states, national interest trumps everything else.
 Since the Abraham Accords hit the headlines in 2020, many had posed the question: Would there be a Saudi rapprochement with Israel? Mediated by the United States, the Abraham Accords are bilateral agreements on the normalisation of ties signed between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.
 Initially, the answers in so far as Saudi Arabia was concerned took the same form -- it was an idea whose time had not yet come, particularly since the kingdom is the guardian of the holy places.
 Over the past three years, there were some signs that something was afoot. In late 2020, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in Neom, the futuristic techno-city in Saudi Arabia that has symbolised MBS' plans for his kingdom. The absence of more concrete moves in the aftermath of that meeting meant the issue receded from view. But earlier in 2023 came news that a deal was indeed being discussed. Many remained sceptical, dismissing the idea as too far-fetched.
 Several events over the last few weeks, though, indicated otherwise. On Sept 19 came news that the US was discussing terms of a mutual defence treaty with Saudi Arabia that would resemble the pacts it has with Japan and South Korea. An agreement under which the US would commit to Saudi defence was apparently a key demand of Riyadh's in exchange for normalisation.
 More eye-opening were MBS' remarks during a rare interview in English with Fox News. Though he made the usual noises about the Palestinian question, two things stood out: First, he said Saudi Arabia and Israel were getting closer to a deal "every day". Second, he said the kingdom's aim was to "ease the life of the Palestinians" -- a very broad framing that could have meant anything, including a massive cash injection, which Riyadh could afford without batting an eyelid.
 Perhaps the strongest signal that the gears were turning was visits by Israeli ministers to Saudi Arabia for the first time, and a trip that the Saudi envoy to the Palestinians made to the West Bank, which entailed him passing through an Israeli border checkpoint.
 All hell has now broken loose following Hamas' massive attack on Israel on Oct 7, during which the militant group launched thousands of rockets on Israel, breached security borders and took hostages. Scores have been killed on both sides since then, with Israel declaring war, and violence has ratcheted up.
 It is becoming clear that one major motivation for Hamas' attack was to disrupt the Israel-Saudi normalisation process. Hamas clearly wants to make the Palestinian issue front and centre, again, for Arab populations and leaders. Concerned that its own relevance is receding along with that of Palestine, the group resorted to violence -- even though those that will bear the brunt of retaliation will be the very people it governs. This should not come as a surprise: The welfare of its people has always been a secondary consideration for Hamas. Iran, which has been vocal against normalisation, reportedly had a hand in planning the latest operation.
 Points to ponderWhere does this leave Saudi-Israel normalisation, and what are the takeaways for Singaporeans? It is important to note that a deal serves the US and Israeli national interest in relatively straightforward ways. Getting the Arab world's most influential power to normalise ties with Tel Aviv has obvious rewards. Examining what is in it for the Saudis is more instructive. Apart from a defence treaty, the kingdom is reportedly also seeking US aid to develop a civilian nuclear programme. In the Fox interview, MBS cautioned that if Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, the Saudis will "have to" get one, too. A civilian nuclear programme is seen by many as a pathway to a military one.
 A deal for Riyadh, then, is more about its security vis-a-vis Iran than any other issue, including the Palestinians. Though Saudi Arabia and Iran signed a much- ballyhooed agreement to restore ties earlier this year, there is little doubt that deep mistrust remains between the two. Even a relatively innocuous football game can spark trouble: Just last week, a Saudi club refused to play a game with an Iranian side in Isfahan. The reason? A bust of the slain former commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Major-General Qassem Soleimani, was on display in the stadium. Paradoxically, any Iranian involvement in the Gaza violence will only entrench the Saudi view of the threat from Teheran.
 A second reality that Singaporeans must absorb is that the Palestinian issue has receded in importance for Arab and Muslim leaders in the Middle East. A big reason for this is the ineptitude of the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, which have not only failed to seize perfectly good opportunities to improve the lot of those they govern, but have, in fact, made things worse for them. Hamas' latest action is no doubt aimed at reversing this trend. But the massive retaliation it has invited will only deepen Palestinian misery. Apart from offensive military operations, Israel has imposed a siege on Gaza, cutting off food, water, electricity and gas. The permits that allow thousands to work in Israel also hang in the balance.
 If anything, the Abraham Accords underlined this reality, and acted as a proof-of-concept. Despite an expected backlash against Arab rulers for the so-called "betrayal" of Palestinians, nothing happened.
 To be sure, even before the weekend's violence, there were several major obstacles in the way of an Israel-Saudi Arabia normalisation, including the fact that a mutual defence treaty between Washington and Riyadh would almost certainly be off the books.
 Given the current polarised domestic environment in the US, there is little that politicians on either side of the aisle can agree on. The ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Oct 3 and rising tide of Republican opposition to further aid for Ukraine underline just how fractured America is now. Approval for a mutual defence treaty requires a super-majority in the US Senate, which is nigh impossible now. One might as well wish for world peace.
 But a treaty is one thing, an agreement that the White House can sign off on is quite another. One need not have to delve into the history books for a blueprint: On Sept 13, the US and Bahrain signed a defence and economic cooperation agreement. With some tweaks, such a deal might be palatable to Riyadh and, given the lack of daylight between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, it could even be considered a dress rehearsal.
 Another issue to consider is the Israeli government, the most extreme in the country's history. Normalisation will require at least token concessions to the Palestinians, something that some elements in the current coalition deem odorous. However, the Hamas attacks have galvanised talk of a national unity government. It is not inconceivable that Mr Netanyahu could now ditch his far-right coalition in favour of an alliance with his erstwhile foes, Mr Yair Lapid and Mr Benny Gantz.
 At the end of the day, the real sticking point in normalisation is not the Palestine issue -- although it can be a fig leaf for the Saudis if they decide they are not getting enough bang for their buck. It is whether the US is willing to budge on the mutual defence pact and on the nuclear issue. But, as mentioned earlier, there is a workaround for the former. And, on the latter, the 123 Agreement between the US and India in 2005 provides the basis to take things forward.
 All these obstacles are pitched against an onrushing tide: It is in the national interest of Israel, Saudi Arabia and the US for a normalisation deal to be sealed. There will be further twists and turns in this saga, as the latest violence has shown, but the prospects for a deal have only been damaged, not destroyed.
 Stranger things have happened in the pursuit of national interest -- a fundamental tenet in relations between states. It is a reality that Singaporeans must expect, and accept.

Israel experienced two failures rolled into one

LONDON  Few borders were as carefully monitored as the one between Israel and the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. 
 The high-rise border fence was bristling with heat- and light-activated early warning devices. A strip of no-man's land separated the fence from Israel's territory. Acoustic sensors were laid deep into the ground to detect any attempt to dig tunnels under the border. 
 And a network of around 30 automatically triggered machine gun positions was poised to greet any would-be intruder into Israel with a hail of deadly bullets.
 Yet, all this proved to be useless over the Oct 7-8 weekend, as fighters belonging to Hamas, the militant Palestinian organisation in control of the Gaza Strip, breached Israel's defences.
 More than 1,000 Hamas fighters are now known to have penetrated deep into Israel, inflicting on the country its worst tally of civilian casualties since the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948.
 The key explanation for this stunning operation is a monumental Israeli intelligence failure, compounded by an equally big failure of planning and logistics by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), the country's allegedly invincible military.
 In effect, Israel experienced two failures rolled into one.
 The Shin Bet, Israel's domestic security service; the Mossad, which is responsible for covert anti-terrorism operations; and Aman, the military intelligence organisation, have a formidable reputation for ruthless professionalism.
 They run extensive spy networks throughout the Palestinian territories. They also operate one of the world's most sophisticated electronic eavesdropping networks, relying on artificial intelligence software and native Arab-speaking analysts to process literally millions of pieces of data on a daily basis.
 Why such an organisation failed to spot a Hamas operation, which clearly took months to prepare, will be the subject of countless studies by intelligence organisations around the world for years to come.
 But even at this early stage, some explanations are evident.
 Hamas turned weakness into strength -- knowing it could not protect its communication links, it simply did not use them.
 Some of its fighters may have been trained for the operation outside Gaza.
 But since infiltrating Israel has always been the organisation's key objective, its fighters did not need to know that they were destined to take part in a massive single operation. 
 So there was no one to leak this information to Israeli spies.
 Hamas was also good at deception -- and particularly deceptive measures the Israelis wanted to believe in.
 For more than a year, Israeli analysts convinced themselves that Hamas was less interested in fighting and more concerned with improving Gaza's rickety economy.
 So Hamas' leaders reinforced this message by hinting that they wanted more ordinary Gazans to be allowed to work in Israel, and by asking for more aid money from Qatar, an important humanitarian backer.
 The Israelis swallowed the ruse unhesitatingly.
 "In recent weeks, Hamas has found itself in financial distress due to disagreements with Qatar, which helps with its civilian budgets," Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi confidently told journalists a week ago, before adding that "Hamas is very, very restrained".
 The strategic surprise inflicted on Israel was reinforced with some deft use of technology.
 Israel's automatic machine gun positions were taken out by simple Hamas-operated drones.
 Other Israeli electronic posts were jammed; this applied in particular to the IDF's southern regional headquarters. 
 And Hamas also deployed a new "kamikaze" drone.
 The Israelis knew that Hamas was developing drone capability. Tunisian-born Mohammed al-Zawari, an aeronautics engineer and the brains behind Hamas' drone programme, was assassinated by Mossad agents in 2016.
 But the Israelis certainly did not know how advanced their opponents' drone programme was; and Israel's intelligence community underestimated the sheer discipline and organisation of Hamas.
 Israel's colossal intelligence failure was compounded by serious military logistics shortcomings.
 Most of the IDF units were in the West Bank, the other part of the occupied Palestinian territories.
 Moving troops to cope with the Hamas incursion proved to be a chaotic affair, with some units wasting precious time waiting for transportation.
 The IDF command also had to cope with a more general national mobilisation of troops and with the need to shift units to the border with Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah, another well-armed militia, is lying in wait. 
 Israel's security planners grew so complacent about their country's military superiority that they appear to have had no well-rehearsed contingency plans for dealing with a major incursion into their territory.
 As a result, IDF troops continued to battle Hamas fighters inside Israel a full three days after the incursion started.
 It was only on Tuesday morning that the IDF regained control of the Gaza border, according to its top spokesman, Rear-Admiral Daniel Hagari.
 The shock suffered by Israel's military establishment is considerable.
 "In my 26 years of covering Israel's defence establishment", wrote Mr Amos Harel, one of the country's top military commentators, soon after the Hamas incursion began, "I cannot remember such an awful day".
 Israel spent a fortune on monitoring its defences, he lamented. "Yet, at the moment of truth, we knew nothing."

 Start-up incubator Trendlines Group, based in Israel and Singapore, does not anticipate "significant impact" on its operations arising from the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas.
 The Catalist-listed group said in a bourse filing on Monday that "limited impact" is expected on some of its portfolio companies' operations. 
 The company, which has its headquarters in Misgav Business Park in northern Israel, said its operations are "well distant" from the military activities in the south.
 Still, the impact of such an event has ramifications for the whole company, Trendlines said, including staff being called up for army duty.
 Israel declared a state of war on Oct 7 after Palestinian militant group Hamas fired some 2,200 missiles from the Gaza Strip into the country. So far, more than 1,100 people have been reported killed in Israel and Gaza.
 "Sadly, Israelis are well experienced in dealing with emergency situations and responding quickly to contain terrorist damage," the company's chairman and chief executive Todd Dollinger said. "We are doing all we can to help our staff, companies and all in need."
 The company, which invests in and incubates innovation-based medtech and agrifood technology start-ups, said it will continue to monitor the well-being of its staff and the situation.

Hamas has hurt both Israel and Palestine

Byline: , Hamas has hurt both Israel and Palestine
Body


The weekend terrorist attack that Hamas carried out on Israel from the restive Palestinian enclave of Gaza represents the worst breach in Israeli defences since the Yom Kippur War of 1973. The Jewish state's costly failure to anticipate that assault by a coalition of Arab states has been replicated in the inability of its intelligence apparatus to detect and deter Hamas' preparations for a combined offensive by air, land and sea whose magnitude and sophistication could not have been achieved overnight. The barbaric attack, which has claimed at least 1,200 lives in Israel, witnessed babies being butchered, entire families being slaughtered and women being raped and paraded like primitive war trophies. Dozens have been taken hostage, to be used cynically as bargaining chips in future negotiations -- or killed. This bloodthirsty incursion into Israel's territorial integrity must be condemned unequivocally. Singapore has condemned the attack strongly. This is the time for all countries to take terrorism seriously.
 The attack's unfolding repercussions need to be considered in the best interests of peace in the Middle East. Israel has responded with a fearsome counter-offensive that includes air strikes on suspected Hamas facilities in the Gaza Strip amid the complete blockade of the enclave, where two million Palestinians live. As Palestinian civilian casualties -- now more than 900 -- increase, it is only natural that global sympathies will shift from the undeserved sufferings of Israelis to those of innocent Palestinians who are paying the price for Hamas' criminal acts carried out in their stolen name. While Israel's punitive response is eminently understandable, its strategic goal should be to regain deterrent advantage over Hamas. This will not be easy given that the terrorist group has consolidated and entrenched its presence during its rule over Gaza since 2007, but Hamas must be neutralised militarily. 
 The regional front is important as well. Hamas timed its assault to undermine the evolving prospects of the Abraham Accords, promoted by the United States to normalise ties between Israel and Arab states. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan have signed up to the accords, and the expected inclusion of Saudi Arabia would give them substantive strategic breadth. Palestinian fears of being marginalised by the accords are understandable, but recourse to terrorist tactics to refocus global attention on the Palestinian cause is not. Iran can only benefit from stalemated relations between its two arch-rivals, Israel and Saudi Arabia. 
 The end goal in Middle East peace cannot but be the two-state solution that would see the establishment of an independent state of Palestine that coexists alongside Israel. That solution appears to be out of sight at this moment, but the night is darkest before dawn.

Middle East crisis a hot button topic in India

NEW DELHI/KOLKATA  In less than 24 hours after the first tranche of Hamas' rockets began landing in Israel last Saturday, the conflict cast its shadow on domestic politics in India.
 On the day of the attack, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) targeted its rival Congress party on X, formerly Twitter,  to capitalise on this renewed conflagration in West Asia for domestic political gain.
 The BJP's tweet compiled terror attacks from 2004 to 2014 when the Congress was in power, painting the party's handling of terror as "weak-kneed" and its own as strong. 
 "What Israel is facing today, India suffered between 2004-14. Never forgive, never forget...," the BJP wrote, adding rancour to an environment already politically charged ahead of the 2024 General Election.
 In a subsequent tweet, the BJP also criticised the Congress' "incompetent" handling of the fallout of terror attacks in Mumbai in 2008, in contrast to India's 2019 air strikes against terrorists in Pakistan in retaliation for the killing of 40 paramilitary troopers in a suicide attack in Kashmir. 
 Pakistan has denied it had any role in the attack, or that India actually hit a terror camp in its territory.
 The video ends by asking Indians if they want to return to a "period of bomb blasts" or to one of "peace and development".
 The Congress retaliated by comparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 78-day silence on the conflict in India's Manipur state, where more than 200 have been killed in ethnic strife since May, with his prompt statement on the conflict in Israel.
 The BJP's tweets were seen to be in poor taste by its critics, who accused it of trying to milk an ongoing crisis. 
 Analysts noted the BJP's political strategy is aimed at reviving public anger against the Congress' perceived governance failures, including on national security, and to bank on the goodwill for Israel.
 Public support for Israel in India is due to a variety of reasons, including its resolve to stand against Islamic cross-border terrorism. 
 It also comes amid deep polarisation in India between Hindus and Muslims, something analysts said could further benefit the BJP and help it consolidate support.
 "The war in the Middle East is one more event that will divide India vertically... It helps the BJP to take an unambiguous stand as it adds to its efforts to consolidate votes of the Indian nationalist," said senior journalist Sheela Bhatt. 
 "But popular perception of the Middle East war amongst the vast majority remains in favour of Israel and that's an advantage to Modi." 
 Mr Modi, who in 2017 became the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel, led the nation in expressing deep sympathy for Israel last Saturday, less than 12 hours after the attacks began. 
 "Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families," he said on X.
 Both on and off social media, many Indians, including those from the BJP and affiliated organisations, have been vocal in expressing their support for Israel against Hamas, seeking to exploit the conflict for political gain. 
 At least two rallies have also been held in support of Israel, including one in New Delhi with participants from the BJP's youth wing carrying placards bearing the Israeli flag. 
 This public support for Israel also enabled Hindu right-wing troll accounts to latch on to the conflict and push out a narrative attacking Indian Muslims for supporting Hamas and terror. 
 The Hindu right wing, whose ideologues envision India as a land of, and for, Hindus, has had a long historical affinity with Zionism, the nationalist movement that has sought to create a Jewish national state in Palestine, as well as with Israel, whose military strength they wish to emulate in India in its conflicts with its neighbours. 
 The admiration for Israel has further deepened since the Congress established full diplomatic ties with the country in 1992.
 For many in India, Israel is also seen as a friend that stepped up during a time of need, supplying weapons such as mortar and ammunition that others would not during India's war with Pakistan in Kargil in 1999.
 Still the support for Israel does not mean that there is no sympathy for Palestine in India.
 There was at least one march by students of Aligarh Muslim University in support of Palestinians. The students were later booked by the police for "promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion". 
 The Congress put out a nuanced statement. Its leader, Mr Jairam Ramesh, condemned the "brutal attacks on the people of Israel", but also underlined the importance of dialogue and negotiations to fulfil the "legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people".
 Mr Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a Delhi-based writer and journalist, however, felt that this line of politicking by the BJP would have limited gain. 
 "I'm not sure this is actually going to have great electoral benefit. This will only reinforce (the BJP's messaging), because the level of polarisation is so deep," he said.

Israeli siege of Gaza raises fears of humanitarian disaster

LONDON Israel's economic siege of Gaza is contrary to international law, the European Union's top diplomat has said.
 Referring to the weekend attack by Gaza-based fighters belonging to the Hamas militant organisation in which at least 1,200 Israelis -- most of them civilians -- perished, Mr Josep Borrell, who heads the EU's diplomatic service, said that "Israel has a right to self-defence".
 But, he added: "This has to be done within international law... Cutting water, cutting electricity, cutting food to a mass of civilian people is against international law." 
 His statement was echoed by Mr Volker Turk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who warned Israel on Tuesday that "the imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law".
 However, even as the authorities in neighbouring Egypt are examining options to alleviate the plight of civilians in Gaza and various plans for the creation of a "humanitarian corridor" to Gaza are being discussed, it is doubtful that Israel will lift its economic blockade, especially since Israeli troops are now poised to launch a land offensive on the Palestinian enclave.
 Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a "complete siege" of the estimated 2.2 million Gaza residents on Monday. "No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel," he vowed.
 This is in addition to broader economic restrictions on Gaza, which the Israelis imposed 16 years ago, limiting the ability of Gazans to import certain commodities and materials that the Israelis deem valuable for military activities.
 The movement of people in and out of the enclave is also heavily restricted by Israel, which controls a 51km-long border with Gaza and Egypt and polices the remaining 11.5km of Gaza's southern frontier.
 Although Gaza has an extensive coastline and a thriving fishing tradition, less than 4 per cent of its water is drinkable, and about half its residents are unemployed.
 More than half of the territory's electricity needs are supplied by Israel, and even the limited electricity generated locally depends on Israeli fuel supplies, which have also stopped now.
 Mr Jalal Ismail, the head of Gaza's energy authority, said that local generators have ceased operating.
 Israel is pursuing a number of objectives through its blockade.
 The first relates to domestic political considerations: Israeli ministers are finding it impossible to justify to their electorate why they should continue supplying electricity to a territory where the perpetrators of the single-biggest bloodshed in the Jewish state's history are based.
 The Israeli military also calculates that Hamas' difficulties in managing the territory will be further complicated if residents' lives are miserable.
 More importantly, the Israelis are looking to have extra bargaining chips for the inevitable haggling that will start with Hamas over the fate of the estimated 100 to 150 Israeli and other citizens taken by the militants and now held hostage somewhere in the Gaza Strip.
 Israeli commandos recently captured several junior Hamas commanders, intending to trade them against Israeli hostages. Concessions over necessities like electricity could be next on offer in return for Hamas freeing some of the Israelis it holds.
 There is little doubt that the siege violates international law because it constitutes the collective punishment of civilians. However, the demand for retribution for the deaths of hundreds of Israelis in the rocket and other attacks by Hamas last Saturday will be so great that such legal arguments are unlikely to hold sway.
 Conditions in Gaza are dire, with hospitals no longer functioning and all economic activity ceasing. If nothing is done by the end of this week, widespread malnutrition is a distinct possibility.
 Gaza's border with Egypt remains open, although the Egyptians are deeply suspicious of Hamas and have allowed only limited fuel and emergency medical supplies.
 The United States is negotiating with Egypt to create potential escape routes for Gazans fleeing violence.
 The World Food Programme, a UN agency and the world's largest humanitarian organisation, has also called for the creation of "humanitarian corridors" to distribute food and other essentials to the people of Gaza.
 But with an estimated 300,000 Israeli troops now massing around Gaza in preparation for an all-out offensive against Hamas, the Israeli government will be in no mood to agree to the creation of corridors which will hamper its forces' movement.
 A bigger humanitarian disaster is, therefore, almost guaranteed.

The global economy is resilient but limping

Length: 940 words
Byline: Martin Wolf, The global economy is resilient but limping
Body


The last four years have brought three huge shocks: Covid-19; post-Covid-19 supply disruption; and Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent surges in commodity prices. Is this series of vast shocks now over? The deadly assault on Israel and conflict in Gaza suggests that the answer may be "no". Recent turmoil in bond markets is another mark of persistent lack of predictability.
 Thus, the carefully prepared analysis of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) may already be a bit out of date. Nevertheless, it is, as always, very helpful. What it tells us is both encouraging and disturbing. The world economy has proved resilient, but performance has deteriorated in the longer term, combined with a divergence in the performance of rich and poorer countries relative to expectations.
 Start with resilience. Here are three encouraging developments. The IMF has had no need to make any significant changes to its April forecasts; the financial turbulence of last spring -- with the collapse of US regional banks and Credit Suisse -- has abated; and, most importantly, there is growing evidence that inflation may be reduced to target without recessions. Thus, disinflation may prove more "immaculate" than I expected. 
 The WEO notes that labour markets remain strong in many high-income countries, without evidence of "wage-price spirals". There is also evidence of "wage compression", with lower wages rising relative to higher ones. The WEO suggests this might be due to the amenity value of flexible and remote working for skilled workers. They are prepared to work at home for lower pay.
 Nevertheless, significant short-term risks remain. One is that China's property crisis becomes far worse. Another is the possibility of further volatility in commodity prices. Another is that consumption weakens as Covid-19-era savings become exhausted, especially in the United States. Yet another is that inflation proves more resilient than expected: The fact that it seems possible to lower inflation without a recession is not a reason for abandoning the effort prematurely. Finally, fiscal policy will prove more tightly constrained in this new world. Not least it means that developing countries are struggling with expensive debt. Further financial shocks seem likely.
 Moreover, and unfortunately, resilience does not imply a good performance. Thus, in 2023, global output will be some 3 per cent lower than was forecast before the pandemic. What is more, these losses are rather small in the high-income countries -- in the US, there is even a slight gain. But in emerging and developing countries, the impact has been more adverse. This reflects the far greater ability of high-income countries to cope with shocks, relative to the poorer ones, which lack the capacity to create vaccines or borrow money cheaply. As a result, the pandemic, war in Ukraine and climate shocks have reversed decades-long trends in poverty reduction. According to the World Bank, up to 95 million more people were living in extreme poverty in 2022 than in 2019.
 This poor and divergent recent economic performance needs to be put in a longer-term context. The WEO notes that there has been a 1.9 percentage point decline in medium-term global growth prospects from 2008 to 2023 in WEO forecasts. The decline is general, but it is particularly significant for the developing countries. The expected number of years needed for emerging and developing countries to close half the gap in incomes per head with high-income economies has risen sharply, from 80 years for projections in the April 2008 WEO to about 130 years for projections in April 2023. The glad story of economic convergence is stalling.
 There are more long-term difficulties ahead. One is climate: The world experienced its hottest September ever this year after surpassing the previous record by an "extraordinary" 0.5 deg C. Moreover, if real interest rates are going to be permanently higher, as some believe, the conditions for long-term investment and growth will also be permanently worse, just when a huge surge in investment is needed to meet climate challenges and wider development goals. The fracturing of the world economy, with rising protectionism and intense geostrategic competition, is likely to intensify all this. At worst, the scarring of recent years will prove not just irreversible, but a harbinger of permanently damaged performance.
 In the last resort, all these are essentially political problems, which is another way of saying they are almost insoluble. We have the resources and technology needed to manage them. There is no good reason why so many people should live in such dire circumstances. There is also no reason why we should fail to tackle climate and other environmental challenges. But to do so, we need to recognise our common interests, the need for collective action and the imminence of what were until recently thought to be remote possibilities.
 Collectively, we are bad at thinking and acting in sensible ways. And, right now, we are getting worse, as the chaos in Washington, bad policy choices in China, Russia's criminal war in Ukraine, the failure to reach any sort of peace between Israel and the Palestinians and the inability to avoid some of the consequences of the recent shocks for poor countries all show.
 At the annual meetings in Marrakech, policymakers need to agree to a huge increase in resources for the IMF and the World Bank. Just about everyone knows that. Will that happen? One must very much doubt it. But it should. It is high time for humanity to grow up a little. Financial Times

JAKARTA Indonesia will evacuate its citizens from the Palestinian Territories once it is safe for it to do so, Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi said on Wednesday, and contingency plans are being worked on to ensure they return safely. 
 The archipelago's efforts to bring its people home run concurrently with those of other countries in the region, as nations including Singapore advise their citizens to leave Israel as soon as possible via available commercial options.
 Ms Retno told reporters on the sidelines of the Archipelagic and Island States Forum in Jakarta that Indonesia already has data on the number of its citizens in the conflict area.
 "There is an evacuation plan, but the situation does not yet allow for movement," she said.
 She added that the International Committee of the Red Cross has requested support in evacuating Indonesians.
 There are 45 Indonesians currently in the Palestinian Territories, and 10 of them are in the Gaza Strip, which has been the main target of the Israeli military's air strikes. 
 There are also 230 Indonesians currently carrying out religious tourism activities in several locations in Israel. 
 Indonesia has made contact with Brazil, which currently holds the presidency of the United Nations Security Council, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, said Ms Retno.
 She added that officials are in touch with their counterparts from the Philippines, which has an embassy in Israel. 
 Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, has no official diplomatic relationship with Israel.
 In order to ensure its people return home safely, Indonesia's Foreign Affairs Ministry is preparing to evacuate citizens through countries closest to the Palestinian Territories, namely Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt. 
 As at Thursday, 5,990 Thai citizens have registered for voluntary repatriation, according to the Royal Thai Embassy in Tel Aviv. 
 Twenty-one Thais have been killed in the conflict, while 14 have been injured and 16 abducted. 
 According to Agence France-Presse, Hamas has seized around 150 people as hostages. 
 There are 30,000 Thai workers in Israel, with about 5,000 of them in the conflict area. 
 Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Jakkapong Sangmanee said on Tuesday that the return of the bodies cannot be undertaken until Israeli forces have fully secured areas affected by the conflict. 
 Arrangements for some Thai citizens to return home have been made, and the first batch of 15 arrived on Thursday. This group included those who were injured but fit for travel. 
 Malaysia's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday it is making arrangements to repatriate five of its citizens in the Palestinian Territories.
 Foreign Minister Zambry Abdul Kadir said that this process is being carried out with the cooperation of the Philippine Embassy. 
 The five citizens are a woman and a mother with three children who are holding Malaysian passports.
 The Philippine government is making preparations to assist 38 of its people in the Gaza Strip who have signalled their intentions to be repatriated.
 There were over 30,000 Filipinos in Israel as at December 2021, and the Philippine Presidential Communications Office said in a statement on Monday that Filipinos living in Israel have not requested immediate repatriation. 
 Two Filipinos have been killed in Israel. Three Filipinos remain missing, while 26 others have been rescued by Israeli security forces.

S'pore mustn't let external events affect precious peace: Shanmugam

Body


External events must never be allowed to affect the precious peace in Singapore, said Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam.
 Speaking to the media on Thursday, he said the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict will have a significant impact across the world, including in Singapore and South-east Asia.
 He said: "This is going to be quite a tough period. But our fundamental attitude cannot change. We are all Singaporeans. We have a precious peace within Singapore; we must never let external events affect that."
 His comments come after Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel in the early hours last Saturday, killing hundreds of Israelis, including women and children, and taking hostages. Israel then declared war, striking targets in Gaza.
 Since last Saturday, more than 1,400 people have been killed in Gaza, while more than 1,300 people have been killed in Israel.
 The minister said that what is happening in the Middle East is going to evoke strong emotions, but that Singaporeans must maintain their peace.
 "There are deep divides in how people are reacting. And as the conflict unfolds, these divides are inevitably going to become deeper," he said.
 Mr Shanmugam said these divides are significant, and are often along racial and religious lines.
 He added: "The suffering of innocent civilians caught in the conflict is a very emotive one. But, in terms of our own religious harmony and understanding, we are in a fairly good position.
 "We have open and frank conversations. There is a lot of mutual respect and trust between religious and racial groups, and Singaporeans strongly value our racial and religious diversity and harmony."
 He also mentioned the study released by the Pew Research Centre in September that found high levels of inter-religious tolerance and acceptance in Singapore.
 The study found that in most South-east Asian countries, respondents said that belonging to their country's majority religion was very important for national identity.
 But this was not the case in Singapore, with about 90 per cent of respondents here saying that various religions were compatible with Singapore's culture and values.
 Mr Shanmugam said: "It is not something you see in many other countries. And most Singaporeans say that Singapore's religious, ethnic, cultural diversity is a good thing for the country and makes Singapore better. This is really quite remarkable. 
 "Our religious leaders, our people are very different, compared with many other countries... What we have built over the years and what we now have is precious and extremely remarkable. And we must do our best to protect it."
 The minister reiterated Singapore's support for the two-state solution on Israel-Palestine, which would allow both Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side as independent states.
 He said: "Our position on Israel-Palestine, and our support for the two-state solution, is well known. It has been stated repeatedly."
 In July, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean met Israeli and Palestinian leaders on a working trip to the region, saying the two-state solution would be the only viable option to achieve a durable, just and comprehensive solution.
 The two-state solution is also consistent with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
 Mr Shanmugam said on Thursday that it is possible to hold strong views on the conflict, yet condemn acts of terrorism.
 "It is possible to deplore how the Palestinians have been treated over the years. It is possible to deeply sympathise with the plight of the Palestinians, and yet still unequivocally condemn the terrorist attacks carried out in Israel.
 "These atrocities cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever, whether of fundamental problems or historical grievances," he said.
 Asked how he thought Israel should respond, the minister said any response has to be consistent with international law and with international rules of war, adding that several other countries have made this point.
 In a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he was deeply saddened by the tragic loss of many Israeli lives as a result of the terrorist attacks by Hamas last Saturday.
 "Singapore strongly condemns the attacks, and the murder and abduction of innocent civilians," he said.
 "Such acts cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever."
 The conflict between Israel and Hamas militants has seen demonstrations and related incidents being reported around the world.
 This has led to countries like Britain, Canada, France and Germany stepping up security around sensitive areas such as synagogues, mosques and schools.
 Mr Shamugam said Singapore is an attractive target, and security agencies here are watching the situation closely.
 He said there have been stepped-up patrols at some events and places, and that places which are possible targets have had their security reassessed.
 On Tuesday, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a travel advisory saying Singaporeans in Israel should leave the country as soon as possible.
 Those who choose to remain are urged to stay vigilant and monitor local developments closely, and avoid areas where large crowds gather, such as the Old City and East Jerusalem. 
 These areas include the Temple Mount, which houses the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
 Singaporeans are also advised to avoid all non-essential travel to Israel because of the ongoing conflict.
 Meanwhile, Israel's military said on Thursday it was conducting a large-scale strike on Hamas targets in Gaza, but gave no details. 
 Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Hecht, spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces, said the targets include Hamas' political leaders as well as military ones. 
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv to meet leaders on both sides of the conflict. His visit is to show Washington's enduring support for Israel, secure the release of captives, including Americans, and prevent a wider war from erupting.

Iran's next steps in Israel-Hamas war could determine if conflict engulfs region

London While most of Israel's military is now focused on what is likely to be a massive ground offensive in Gaza to destroy Palestinian militant organisation Hamas, the eyes of most intelligence organisations around the world remain fixed on another part of the Middle East: Iran. Its actions in the next few weeks would decide whether the current war sets an entire region on fire. 
 Although defeating Hamas is currently Israel's chief objective, Iran remains Israel's most significant regional enemy.
 The Iranians have a vast array of military and paramilitary forces, including various missile systems able to strike deep inside Israel.
 More importantly, Iran has bankrolled Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The latter has a more extensive arsenal than the militaries of most Arab states.
 Iran can use its proxies to engage Israel in a two-front war, precisely what Israel's military planners fear most.
 Therefore, the region's critical strategic unknown is whether Iran will ultimately enter the current fray.
 Teheran has benefited politically from the latest tragic turn of events.
 Before Hamas' deadly incursion into Israel, the Iranians were worried about the possibility that Israel and Saudi Arabia would reach an agreement under United States sponsorship to normalise their bilateral relations. Such a Saudi-Israel deal would marginalise Iran and serve as a prelude to Israel's potential attack on Iran's nuclear installations.
 But given the current flare-up and the sight of Israeli forces pulverising Gaza, the Saudis clearly cannot be seen talking to Israel.
 Although Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman remains deeply distrustful of both Hamas and the Iranians, he had no option but to pledge his country to an effort "to end Israel's war crimes against Palestine" in a phone conversation on Wednesday with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.
 The assumption in most Middle Eastern capitals is that, even if the current war between Israel and Hamas is brief, US President Joe Biden will not be able to restart the discreet diplomatic dialogue between Saudi Arabia and Israel before the American presidential election in November 2024. And that is an achievement for Iran.
 Did Iran help Hamas plan last Saturday's attack on Israel to achieve this objective'
 Unidentified intelligence sources quoted by The Wall Street Journal claim that, since early April, officers of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards held regular meetings with officials of Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad -- another Islamist movement in Gaza -- to plan the Hamas operation.
 The American daily adds that Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian attended the meetings at the end of April and the beginning of September.
 No corroboration of this story exists, although circumstantial evidence suggests that the Iranians at least had prior knowledge of the Hamas attack. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, told a public gathering four days before the Hamas incursion that "soon, good news will arrive".
 Be that as it may, Israel and the US are keen not to drag the Iranians into the current war, so they avoid pointing an accusing finger.
 "We have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was behind this particular attack," said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
 Israeli army spokesman Danny Hagari confirmed that there was "no indication at this stage" of Iranian involvement.
 Still, whether Hezbollah would open a second front against Israel by attacking in the north while the bulk of Israel's forces are engaged in Gaza in the south remains one of the war's biggest imponderables.
 Hezbollah, a Shi'ite organisation, has struggled to retain legitimacy in the predominantly Sunni Middle East, a task made even more difficult by Hezbollah's involvement alongside Iran in Syria's civil war.
 So, hitting at Israel now may restore Hezbollah's credibility, a key objective for leader Hassan Nasrallah, who frequently speaks of a "unity of fronts" against Israel.
 But at the same time, Hezbollah knows that Israel has been preparing for a long time for a war on two fronts, and the total mobilisation now declared in Israel is intended to respond to such an eventuality.
 The Israelis have also signalled to Hezbollah and its Iranian backers that, in the event of an attack in the north, Israel's response will not be confined to Lebanon, but it will also attack Iranian targets in neighbouring Syria.
 The US decision to move one of its most potent aircraft carrier groups closer to Israel's shoreline is also intended to deter Hezbollah and Iran, and keep them out of the conflict.
 Still, Israeli troops deployed on the border with Lebanon remain on high alert against the danger that Hezbollah will strike once Israel's military is engaged in intense fighting in Gaza.
 Meanwhile, Syria said Israel launched missile attacks on airports in Damascus and northern Aleppo city on Thursday, putting both out of service. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian was expected to land in Syria as part of a regional tour that began on Thursday.
 The coming weeks will be critical for the entire region.

Security stepped up in Singapore; public urged to be vigilant

Patrols are being stepped up at events and places in Singapore in the light of the situation in Gaza, while places that may be possible targets for attack have had their security reassessed, Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam said on Thursday.
 Security agencies here are watching the situation closely, and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stepped up its measures, he added.
 This includes increasing the security presence for places deemed to be of higher risk, said Mr Shanmugam. 
 "For operational reasons, I cannot tell you the exact plans, but additional measures have been taken," he told reporters at his ministry's headquarters in Novena.
 Singapore's moves come as other countries have taken similar measures following the developing conflict in the Middle East.
 Britain, Canada, France and Germany are among nations stepping up security around potential Jewish targets and pro-Palestinian demonstrations erupting in cities.
 Terrorist groups will try to exploit such conflicts, and Singaporeans must stay vigilant, said Mr Shanmugam.
 Some groups have already issued calls for followers to join a wider jihad against Israel, and there have been reports of anti-Semitic attacks overseas, he noted.
 "This is a period everyone has to be more alert and careful because Singapore is an attractive target," he said.
 Singapore will act against anyone who promotes or espouses extremism and terrorism -- a stance the Republic has made clear over the years, he added.
 The Government has detained Singaporeans under the Internal Security Act because they fell for the pro-Hamas narratives and wanted to fight, he said.
 They include a 20-year-old man detained in March 2021 who had wanted to travel to Gaza to fight alongside Hamas. He had also planned a knife attack against Jews at a synagogue here.
 Amirull Ali, who was a full-time national serviceman in the Singapore Armed Forces when he was arrested in February 2021, had planned to target three Jewish men after their Saturday congregational prayers at the Maghain Aboth Synagogue in Waterloo Street.
 Another man, Mohamed Khairul Riduan Mohamed Sarip, 38, was detained in November 2022 following his plans to travel to Gaza to fight alongside Hamas after watching videos online.
 Khairul, a teacher with the Ministry of Education, had been self-radicalised and had watched videos by radical foreign preachers which discussed the concept of armed jihad in defence of Islam.
 To avoid security scrutiny, Khairul had planned to travel to Gaza under the guise of providing humanitarian aid.  
 Singapore has also detained individuals who intended to attack Muslim targets here, noted Mr Shanmugam. 
 They include a 16-year-old boy who was detained in December 2020. 
 The boy had planned to launch knife attacks against Muslims at two mosques in Singapore after he was influenced by the 2019 Christchurch attack in New Zealand.
 He had made detailed plans and preparations to conduct terrorist attacks at the Assyafaah Mosque in Sembawang and Yusof Ishak Mosque in Woodlands, both of which are near his home, on the second anniversary of the Christchurch terror attack.
 "So far, we have managed to avoid letting international events like these destabilise us within Singapore," said Mr Shanmugam.
 "This is going to be quite a tough period, but our fundamental attitude cannot change: We are all Singaporeans, we have a precious peace within Singapore, and we must never let external events affect that."

Malaysians from across political divide rally in support of Palestinians

KUALA LUMPUR  Thousands of Malaysians rallied on Friday at Kuala Lumpur's National Mosque and other mosques around the country to condemn the Israel-Hamas war and express solidarity with the Palestinians. 
 Leaders from across the political divide -- including former prime ministers Mahathir Mohamad and Muhyiddin Yassin -- and from several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) addressed the 1,000-strong crowd at the National Mosque. 
 Agriculture and Food Security Minister Mohamad Sabu and Deputy Youth and Sports Minister Adam Adli were among several serving Cabinet ministers who attended the gathering after the weekly Friday prayers. 
 The crowd in KL carried placards and flags -- including several flags of Palestine -- as they condemned the attacks in Gaza that have killed more than 1,500 Palestinian civilians following last weekend's raids and rocket attacks by Hamas militants into Israel that killed more than 1,300 Israelis.
 Chants of "Allahu Akbar", or God is great, and "Free Palestine" were heard throughout the rally, which lasted more than one hour under the blazing sun.
 Rallies were reportedly also held in other mosques across Malaysia in a show of support for the Palestinians, and special prayers were conducted for the Palestinians at the end of the Friday prayers.
 The Friday sermon in many mosques around Malaysia carried the theme "For You, Palestine", and described how the Palestinians were ousted from their own land, while denouncing Israeli's "Zionist regime" as "a terrorist nation" over its attacks on Gaza. 
 Most mosques in Malaysia carry Friday sermons officially issued by the federal government.
 "Our duty as Malaysians, no matter what our background or political background is, we must give our full support to the people of Palestine," former prime minister Muhyiddin told the crowd at the rally.
 Meanwhile, Tun Dr Mahathir recalled atrocities committed against the Palestinians throughout the years, and said the attack by Hamas was a retaliatory strike out of desperation.
 Dr Kelvin Yii, youth chief of the Democratic Action Party that is part of Malaysia's unity government, voiced his solidarity with the Palestinian cause. 
 He said that it does not matter that he is Chinese and a Christian, and that he stands firm with Malaysia and the Muslim world in condemning Israel's military actions.
 "I am Chinese. I am a Christian. Today, I stand with the people of Palestine because this is a humanitarian cause. They have been brutalised by Israel's military.
 "It broke my heart when I learnt that hospitals there lack medicine and food, and their electricity was cut off. I was angered when I heard children were killed and schools were bombed," said Dr Yii.
 Other rally speakers included Umno Youth chief Akmal Saleh and Dr Siti Mastura Muhammad, director of the Ameerah NGO that is linked to the opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia. 
 Rally participants included some who came in a bus from Alor Setar, state capital of Kedah, which is more than 400km away from Kuala Lumpur.
 "We left by bus at midnight yesterday," said a retired teacher who gave his name only as Ahmad. 
 "The 40 of us arrived this morning at 8am. We are rice farmers and wanted to take part in this rally to show our support for the people of Palestine."

Conflict posing new questions for China's policy in Middle East: Analysts

Body


BEIJING  The Israel-Hamas war has sparked contrasting reactions from the United States and China, with the ongoing hostilities posing new questions for Beijing's Middle East policy, said analysts. 
 US President Joe Biden pledged moral and military support for its longstanding ally Israel in a televised speech on Tuesday from the White House, calling the violent actions of Hamas "abhorrent" and adding that these cannot be justified.
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday that China is "deeply saddened by the civilian casualties and oppose and condemn acts that harm civilians".
 "We oppose moves that escalate the conflict and destabilise the region, and hope fighting will stop and peace will return soon," she added, noting that the "Palestine question" must be settled while taking care of "each party's legitimate concerns" to end the cycle of conflict.
 Much like the tightrope Beijing had to walk when the Russia-Ukraine war broke out in 2022, its efforts not to criticise either side has again come under scrutiny, particularly as it has recently signalled its willingness to play a bigger role in facilitating peace in the Middle East.
 Professor Joseph Liow, dean of the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences at Nanyang Technological University, told The Straits Times that China is trying to maintain a delicate balancing act between the Palestinians and Israelis.
 Historically, Beijing has been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, in no small part because of its anti-imperialist agenda, he added. Today, China has reservations about being on the same side as the US, in this case supporting Israel, as they are strategic competitors.
 On the other hand, China has improved relations with Israel over the years, although there are still concerns in Israel over China's relationship with Iran, said Prof Liow, an international relations expert. Since the 2000s, China has ramped up investments and undertaken greater involvement in infrastructure projects in Israel. The number of Chinese visiting Israel has also grown.
 "At this point, China will have little influence over events as they unfold, and likely would not want to be too overtly involved in any case. They will, however, be following things very closely, looking out for, for example, the degree of American recommitment to the Middle East," he added.
 Already, China has faced pressure from the US to do more. In Beijing on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged President Xi Jinping to take a stronger stance on the war, and called for China to use its influence with Iran to stop the conflict from spreading.
 He told reporters later that he welcomed an updated statement by China's Foreign Ministry, which condemned the attacks in Israel and the Gaza Strip -- a line missing in its initial response last Saturday. 
 China has been expanding its political clout with Middle East countries in recent years, building on its traditional energy and economic interests, although academics have doubts about Beijing's capacity and interest to be a bigger influence in the region, like the US.
 In a Beijing meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in June, Mr Xi proposed an international peace conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and said China was willing to play an active role in facilitating peace talks. 
 Mr Xi also put forward a three-point proposal to solve the conflict: Establishing an independent Palestinian state based on 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital; channelling more development assistance to Palestinians; and creating the right conditions for the resumption of peace talks. 
 In March, China brokered discussions between bitter rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, resulting in an agreement to restore ties between Riyadh and Teheran -- a diplomatic breakthrough that led to debates about how much of a challenge this presented to US influence in the region.
 On Tuesday, China's Special Envoy on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun said China is ready to work with Egypt -- which is the first Arab country to sign a peace deal with Israel and had previously helped secure a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas -- to end hostilities. Egypt, which shares a border with Gaza, is concerned about a mass exodus of Palestinians into its Sinai peninsula. 
 The root cause of the cycle of conflict is that the Palestine question still has not been settled in a just manner, Mr Zhai said in a phone call with an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official, and the fundamental way out lies in implementing the two-state solution. 
 Mr Zhai also had calls with Palestine, Saudi Arabia and Israel foreign ministry officials to state China's position and promote peace talks. But his Israeli counterpart, Ambassador Rafi Harpaz, expressed "deep disappointment" with China's statements, adding that there was "no clear and unequivocal condemnation of the terrible massacre" committed by Hamas.
 China-Israel relations analyst Carice Witte believes Beijing's current stance is untenable. She told ST it is difficult to see how China can be seen as a neutral actor, with Beijing refusing to call out Hamas for its violent actions. 
 Many who support the Palestinian aim for a state have acknowledged that the heinous crimes by Hamas have nothing to do with self-determination, added Ms Witte, who is executive director of the Sino-Israel Global Network and Academic Leadership, an Israel-based think-tank. 
 "To not clearly oppose Hamas is to support Hamas," she said. "If China's stance on Hamas changes drastically, or if it influences Iran to end (Hamas') call for the evisceration of the Jewish state, then perhaps it will be able to play a role in mediation between Israel and the Palestine Authority."
 Assistant Professor Benjamin Ho of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, who specialises in Chinese foreign policy, said China has little interest to be involved in the conflict in a big way.
 He told ST that he has doubts about the Chinese having a sustained interest in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "So long as the conflict doesn't touch them, they would rather let other countries muddle into the swamp while it remains focused on its interests elsewhere."
 International relations scholar Shi Yinhong of Renmin University told ST that the Chinese position on the conflict is clear: The Israelis and Hamas should agree to an immediate ceasefire and an independent Palestinian state as the final solution.
 However, both sides, as well as the US and its Western allies -- who he believes will support Israel to fight at least a war of revenge to the end -- will not pay real attention to Chinese proposals, he added. "So, for a while at least, Beijing's Middle East policy will be paralysed by the war."
 On the impact of the Israel-Hamas war on US-China ties, he said: "US-China relations have been bad enough, and the war in the Middle East cannot make them remarkably worse."

The British, French, German, Italian and United States governments have issued a joint statement recognising the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and supporting equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike (Hamas threatens to kill captives if Israel strikes civilians, Oct 10). 
 I think this is a fair and balanced statement.
 I am sure most peace-loving countries share the sentiment that all parties involved in this conflict should be guaranteed equal opportunities for their survival as a people and as a country to have real peace. 
 Any unreasonable act to take advantage of each other's weaknesses would amount to provocation and lead to open conflict.
 Therefore, it is unwise to be short-sighted and take unnecessary risks by taking action that the world considers an act of terrorism. 
 It only encourages your opponent to retaliate and expose your weaknesses.
 Singapore has called for an immediate end to the violence and urges all sides to do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians. 
 Their leaders are being called upon to act responsibly to stop further bloodshed. 
 Any further use of force would lead to more hardship for their citizens, whose safety should be the paramount consideration.

AMMAN, Jordan  United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Jordanian King Abdullah in Amman on Friday during the second stop of his most extensive Middle East tour yet.
 Mr Blinken urged people in Gaza City to evacuate to the south. His demand came a day after he visited Israel and held talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the war.
 The US official has expanded his trip from Israel and Jordan to include all the Gulf Arab countries and Egypt, making it his largest tour of the region since taking office in January 2021. 
 On Friday alone, he was expected to visit three more countries, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, where he will spend the night. Before departing for Doha, he is set to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Amman.
 "Across each of these engagements, we will continue pressing countries to help prevent the conflict from spreading, and to use their leverage with Hamas to immediately and unconditionally release the hostages," said Mr Blinken, speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv.
 "We will also discuss how we can continue to make real our affirmative vision for a region that is more peaceful, more prosperous, more secure, more integrated.
 "And, in fact, that is the choice, and the choice in some ways has been made even more stark by the actions of Hamas on Saturday," he added. REUTERS
 WTO chief warns of impact of war on tradeMARRAKECH, Morocco  World Trade Organisation (WTO) chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said she hoped the Israel-Hamas conflict could be ended quickly, warning that it would have a "really big impact" on already weak global trade flows if it widened throughout the region.
 Ms Okonjo-Iweala, in Morocco for this week's annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, said Middle East violence could add to factors throttling trade growth, including higher interest rates, a strained Chinese property market and Russia's war in Ukraine.
 "We hope this ends soon, and it is contained. Our biggest fear is if it widens, because that will then have a really big impact on trade," she said in an interview. "Everybody is on eggshells and hoping for the best."
 Ms Okonjo-Iweala said global uncertainty was already limiting growth in trade, but that would be exacerbated by the sudden onset of war between Israel and the Islamist Hamas group that controls the Gaza Strip
 "There is uncertainty about whether this is going to spread further to the whole region, which could impact very much on global economic growth," she said. "We hope it will end because it does create this uncertainty. It is another dark cloud on the horizon." REUTERS
 N. Korea denies use of its weapons in attackSEOUL  North Korea denied on Friday its weapons were used by Hamas in the attack against Israel, saying the claim made in some media reports was a bid by Washington to divert the blame for the conflict from itself to a third country. 
 This week, military experts said that photos from the conflict showed Hamas militants may be using North Korean weapons, including possible F-7 rocket-propelled grenades. 
 There have been reports of Hamas using the F-7 for several years, said Professor Bruce Bechtol of Angelo State University in Texas, who has done research on North Korea's arms sales.
 The North's official KCNA news agency called the claims of its weapons being used in the attack "a groundless and false rumour".
 "It is nothing but a bid to shift the blame for the Middle East crisis caused by (the United States') wrong hegemonic policy onto a third country, and thus evade the international criticism focused on the empire of evil," it said. REUTERS
 ICC claims jurisdiction over Israel, GazaTHE HAGUE  The International Criminal Court (ICC) has jurisdiction over potential war crimes carried out by Hamas militants in Israel and Israelis in the Gaza Strip, even though Israel is not a member state, the ICC's top prosecutor said on Thursday.
 The occupied Palestinian Territories, including the Gaza Strip, fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC, meaning the court has the authority to prosecute Hamas.
 "If there is evidence that Palestinians, whether they are Hamas or Al-Quds Brigades or the armed wing of Hamas, or any other person or any other national of any other state party, have committed crimes, (then), yes, we have jurisdiction wherever (the crimes) are committed, including on the territory of Israel," ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said in an interview.
 A court of last resort, the ICC prosecutes individuals for alleged criminal conduct when its 123 member states are unwilling or unable to prosecute themselves. 
 Many of the world's major powers are not members, including China, the United States, Russia, India and Egypt. 
 Even if the ICC were to issue warrants in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the court has no police force and would rely on member states to make arrests. REUTERS
 Hamas strike was a terrorist attack: IndiaNEW DELHI  India considers the weekend attack by Hamas militants in Israel a "terrorist attack", a spokesperson for the country's foreign ministry said on Thursday. 
 At the same time, the spokesperson, Mr Arindam Bagchi, reiterated New Delhi's longstanding position for an independent Palestine.
 His remarks were the first reiteration of India's stance on an independent Palestinian state since the latest hostilities broke out between Israel and Hamas at the weekend. 
 "India has always advocated the resumption of direct negotiations towards establishing a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine living within secure and recognised borders, side by side, at peace with Israel," Mr Bagchi said in a weekly briefing. REUTERS

US in a spot as Israel-Hamas tension spills over, Ukraine support frays

WASHINGTON  Domestic tensions have begun to emerge in the United States over the war between Israel and Hamas, as US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin visited Israel on the heels of Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 
 In New York on Thursday, the city authorities cancelled leave and called for police officers to report in uniform for duty on Friday amid rising worries over potential violence against the city's Jewish and Islamic communities. 
 Security was similarly beefed up in Washington and Los Angeles around mosques and synagogues. 
 In one incident on Thursday in New York, a group of men in three cars waving Israeli flags yelled anti-Palestinian remarks at three Arab men in a Brooklyn neighbourhood and then got out of the cars and punched and kicked one of them, an 18-year-old.
 America is not the only place where acrimony over the war threatens to spill over. In Beijing on Thursday, an Israeli diplomat was attacked and stabbed by an unknown man in the street. The diplomat was reportedly in a stable condition in hospital.
 Colleges across the US are witnessing rising tensions as well, after several student organisations reportedly released statements on the conflict that appeared to defend Hamas.
 One of the most controversial came from Harvard, where a group of more than 30 student groups led by the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee, also a student organisation, signed a letter saying that Israel was "entirely responsible for all unfolding violence". 
 After an uproar, the statement was rescinded as several of the organisations withdrew their support. 
 "Some fringe-left groups are aligning with anti-Zionist organisations in the wake of Hamas' attack on Israel," the Anti Defamation League (ADL), which tracks hate, and anti-Semitism in particular, said on Thursday.
 According to the ADL's Centre on Extremism, calls for violence against Jews, Israelis and Zionists on the messaging app Telegram increased 400 per cent in the 18 hours after the Hamas attack on Israel. 
 Meanwhile, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the country's largest Muslim civil rights organisation, said its Maryland office has received "growing reports of Muslim and Arab students experiencing harassment and intimidation in public high schools and on college and university campuses".
 This came as the war reinforces calls, by Republicans in particular, to cut military assistance to Ukraine. 
 With a high chance that the Israel-Hamas war may be prolonged, concern is reportedly growing not just among national security analysts, but also within the Pentagon, over America's ability to stretch increasingly scarce munitions stockpiles to support both Ukraine and Israel.
 "With the US on the hook for continued security for Europe against Russian aggression and promises of more military and economic assistance for the Ukraine war, the administration is being dragged away from its top strategic priority -- China," warned a paper from the Washington think-tank Stimson Centre on Thursday. 
 "If Ukraine's counter-offence stalls, more in Congress may question the 'whatever it takes' White House commitment to Ukraine. Washington may pit aid to Israel and Ukraine against each other," argued the paper, which was co-authored by Dr Robert A. Manning and Dr Mathew Burrows, both distinguished fellows with Stimson's Reimagining US Grand Strategy project.
 Not everyone in Congress is on board with more funding for Ukraine, Mr Michael Walsh, a visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley, told The Straits Times. 
 "In the background, all sides know that China contingencies are lurking," he added.
 But Defence Secretary Austin, on the eve of his visit to Israel, on Tuesday said the US had the ability to support both Ukraine and Israel. 
 "We can do both, and we will do both," he insisted at a press conference in Brussels.
 Politically, the crisis is awkward for President Joe Biden's administration. Israel's intelligence failure is seen as a US failure as well. 
 Just in September, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Middle East was "quieter today than it has been in two decades". 
 "The war and Iran's backing for it are becoming loud Republican talking points and may provide more grist for 2024 (presidential) campaign rhetoric seeking to portray Biden incompetence," Dr Manning and Dr Burrows said. 
 "Biden's already historically low polling numbers will come under even more pressure, clouding his re-election chances in 2024," they added. 
 Still, there is overwhelming bipartisan consensus on backing Israel. 
 But political drama in Washington means that new decisions on military aid to Israel and Ukraine will have to wait until the Republican Party, beset by infighting, agrees on who will fill the currently vacant position of Speaker of the House. 
 The infighting, if prolonged, will be bad for the Republican brand, said Dr Glenn Altschuler, professor of American studies at Cornell University. 
 "But when they settle it, the first order of business will be aid for Israel," he said.

Israel faces risky choices in vow to destroy Hamas

LONDON  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces difficult decisions.
 He and his government have vowed to destroy Hamas, the Palestinian militant organisation responsible for killing more than 1,300 Israelis in the single-biggest attack ever suffered by the Jewish state.
 But as the Israeli ground offensive against Hamas unfolds in the Gaza Strip, all the strategic options facing Mr Netanyahu remain very risky.
 During the week that passed since the Hamas attack, Israel's strategy in confronting the Palestinian organisation remained a familiar one: continuous air strikes, coupled with brief incursions by Israeli commandos and other special forces, either to hit particular Palestinian targets or to probe locations where the estimated 150 Israeli hostages captured by Hamas may be hidden.
 But as Israeli officials made clear from the start, this strategy, used repeatedly over almost two decades, is no longer deemed sufficient, even if it succeeds in hitting Hamas hard.
 This is because Israel's objective is not merely to destroy Hamas but also to be seen to be doing so in a manner that can restore Israel's claim to be the Middle East's most potent military power.
 As far as the Israelis are concerned, Hamas' entire political and military structure that currently controls Gaza must be dismantled, a job that can be accomplished only through an extensive ground invasion.
 The snag is that to invade Gaza, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) -- as the country's armed forces are officially called -- would have to undertake just about the riskiest of all operations expected of a military: street-to-street combat in densely populated urban areas.
 The IDF has known since the 1980s that it would no longer have to confront the regular military of established Arab states and that its main enemies are likely to be non-state militias, such as Hamas or Hezbollah, the Iranian-funded militant organisation based in Lebanon, on Israel's northern borders.
 As a result, special IDF troops have trained over the past 15 years for heavy fighting in urban areas.
 At the Tzeelim Israeli army base located in the Negev desert not far from the border with Gaza, there is a full-scale reproduction of an Arab town where Israeli troops hold exercises involving fighting in built-up areas. The base is ironically nicknamed "Baladia", the Arabic word for "city".
 And by a curious twist of fate, those in charge of Israel's current defences are experts on dealing with Gaza.
 For instance, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant is a former general who commanded the IDF's Gaza Division and was later in charge of Israel's Southern Command. Few can rival his intimate knowledge of Hamas.
 So, although Prime Minister Netanyahu is widely blamed for his allegedly chaotic handling of Israel's security, the current military operations will be primarily decided and executed by the generals rather than the politicians, and those currently commanding the IDF have spent most of their careers preparing for precisely the challenge they now face.
 Israel has also packed a heavy punch. With its general mobilisation of reserves complete, the country now has around half a million soldiers on active deployment, and a massive armour and infantry force is assembled around Gaza's borders.
 The presence of two United States aircraft carrier groups near Israel's shores means that IDF military planners have to worry less about the danger that Hezbollah, the Iranian proxy, would open up another battlefront.
 And, in any case, the bulk of the Israeli air force is available to hit Hezbollah in the north, allowing most of Israel's ground forces to remain deployed against Gaza in the south.
 The Israeli plan appears to rely on a quick advance through the middle of Gaza, cutting the Strip into two sections.
 This could mean that Hamas would be cornered in each half of Gaza and, therefore, be much more vulnerable to being picked apart.
 It could also mean that the Israelis may consider establishing some sort of a protected area in the middle of the Gaza Strip, where civilians could seek refuge from the fighting.
 Israel's order for Gaza residents to evacuate and calls to create an escape route for them as the conflict deepens did not sit well with neighbouring states that are worried about a possible refugee crisis and permanent displacement from Gaza. 
 Jordan's King Abdullah warned against "any attempt to forcibly displace Palestinians from all Palestinian territories or cause their internal displacement", while Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said it is "important that the (Palestinian) people remain steadfast and present on their land".
 Hamas clearly anticipated an Israeli response, so it would have prepared for this eventuality. However, whether the militant organisation expected the full-scale Israeli land invasion it will now get is debatable.
 Still, Hamas fighters know their area much better than any Israeli and are likely to wait in the extensive tunnels criss-crossing Gaza's territory, from where they can ambush Israeli troops.
 There is no doubt that Israel can overrun Gaza quickly. The questions are what human price the Israelis will have to pay in this endeavour and how heavy the Palestinian civilian casualties will be.
 As at Friday, Palestinian authorities said 1,949 Palestinians have been killed and 6,500 injured in Israel's retaliation against Hamas.
 And, as Israel's military commanders know only too well, no war plan, however well drafted and rehearsed, survives first contact with reality.

Stories of fear and loss: Bombs everywhere, missing parents

Body


In the darkness of early Friday morning, at around 2.30am, the message drifted to the residents of northern Gaza Strip. They have 24 hours to evacuate to the south, said Israel in leaflets dropped by its military aircraft. 
 Mr Haitham, 50, the owner of a consulting business, did not wait. Immediately, he, his wife and their daughter left their home in Gaza City and drove to Deir al-Balah nearly 15km away, where they have relatives. It is south of Wadi Gaza, the marker identified by Israel that divides the strip. 
 They just had enough time to take things like important documents, but the drive was smooth as there was little traffic at that hour.
 His family may now be in the "safe" half of Gaza, but he is on edge and worries about water running out, he told The Sunday Times on Friday night over the phone. 
 Israel has banned food, fresh water and electricity into the Gaza Strip, and the United Nations has warned that crucial supplies are running dangerously low. 
 "We're all worried. Water is everything, for drinking and for everything else," said Mr Haitham, who asked that his full name not be used for safety reasons. 
 He is among hundreds of thousands of 1.1 million north Gazans who have abandoned their homes in the last two days ahead of a massive ground invasion by Israel. Others have stayed put, not knowing where they could go in the densely populated territory. 
 Israel has said that it would not let up on its military actions against Gaza until Israeli hostages, numbering about 120, held by Palestinian militant group Hamas are released. 
 On Oct 7, Hamas fighters rampaged through south Israel, killing and kidnapping civilians, prompting retaliatory air strikes on Gaza. 
 More than a week into the Israel-Hamas conflict, stories of fear and loss are emerging -- with more than 3,500 deaths on both sides so far.
 Mr Fadi Abu Shammalah, the executive director of Gaza's general union of cultural centres, wrote in The New York Times: "Women and children from my extended family were killed in an attack on Tuesday, and my cousin was killed on Wednesday. The smell of explosives permeates the entire strip."
 Some Palestinians are posting on social media about blackouts, levelled homes or having no safe spaces to escape amid the Israeli aerial bombardment. 
 "They are basically bombing everywhere. It's literally a humanitarian crisis," Ms Nour AlSaqqa, who is in her 20s and has been posting about life under siege in Gaza on Instagram, told NYT. 
 Ms Plestia Alaqad, who has also been documenting the situation in Gaza on Instagram, told the daily that the past few days are nothing like what she had experienced before. 
 "I thought we are used to wars, you know. That's such a horrible sentence to use, but I'm 22 years old, and I witnessed four wars before. But what is happening is like families are being erased, whole neighbourhoods are being erased."
 Mr Haitham worries about the impact of the conflict on young Palestinians. His teenage daughter has been left traumatised by the "much higher" level of violence in the current war than in previous conflicts. 
 About half of Gaza's 2.3 million population is under 18 years old, he noted, adding that he worries about an ever-escalating spiral of violence. The ongoing onslaught has left the young in living conditions "not near anything normal", which could result in "more anger" towards the Israelis.
 He has three other children: two sons studying in Canada and another son who escaped to Egypt earlier in the week along with Mr Haitham's father before Gaza's Rafah crossing into Egypt was shut.
 Across the border from Mr Haitham's house, an Israeli couple in their 70s were taking their usual morning walk on Oct 7 at a field near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz when Hamas militants swooped in close by.
 The elderly couple dived face down into the grass and sent a text message to their family WhatsApp chat group.
 It was about 11.50am in Singapore when their daughter Iris Haggai, 38, a textile designer who moved to Singapore three years ago with her husband and children, got the message. 
 Worried, Ms Haggai called her mother.
 "The rockets are really too close to us," Ms Haggai's mother said in the call. Her mother seemed unusually afraid in the call. She told her parents to quickly seek shelter in a safe house. 
 When Ms Haggai did not hear from her parents after 30 minutes, she feared the worst. She frantically reached out to friends and neighbours in Kibbutz Nir Oz. She then heard from a friend that her father had been badly injured. 
 Nearly an hour after her call with her mother, Ms Haggai heard that the town was overrun by Hamas militants. 
 In an interview with ST, Ms Haggai said, choking up: "I learnt that the last call made from my mother's phone was to a paramedic. She was asking for assistance because my father was shot by someone on a motorbike. I was told that the paramedic had tried to contact an ambulance to assist my parents, but it was hit by a rocket."
 Ms Haggai was later told by a friend who helped her check that her parents were feared dead.
 She is now in limbo, in Singapore. She has decided against flying to Israel as she has three children, aged two, three and seven, to care for.
 Other Israelis fear for their kidnapped loved ones.
 Ms Noa Argamani was just five days away from her 26th birthday when she was kidnapped by Hamas militants at a music festival near Re'im in Israel, near the Gaza border. 
 Her mother, Ms Liora Argamani, 61, who moved to Israel from China in the 1990s, married an Israeli and settled down there and is battling brain cancer, told NYT: "Having my daughter taken away, it adds to the pain."
 As for Ms Haggai, she said if indeed something untoward had happened to her parents, her only consolation would be that they were together. "I am still in disbelief... I am safe here in Singapore, and I feel like my children are lucky to grow up here in Singapore, where it is safe."

SYDNEY  Thousands of people attended pro-Palestinian rallies in Australian state capitals on Sunday, despite police threats to curb them.
 One of the largest rallies was in Sydney, the capital of the country's most populous state of New South Wales, where protest organiser, the Palestine Action Group, said around 5,000 attended. A Reuters witness estimated the crowd to be 2,000.
 Many rallygoers waved Palestine flags and chanted "Free, free Palestine" in Sydney's Hyde Park, as hundreds of police patrolled the area and nearby streets, and a police helicopter circled low overhead.
 Pro-Palestinian rallies were also held in state capitals Adelaide and Melbourne, where thousands protested, according to The Guardian Australia. REUTERS
 Israel fires back after Syria launches rocketsJERUSALEM  Israel shelled Syria last Saturday after air raid sirens sounded in settlements on the annexed Golan Heights, the army said.
 In a statement, the army said "two rockets were launched from Syria towards Israeli territory that fell in an open area".
 The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Palestinian factions working with Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group had "launched a rocket towards the occupied Golan Heights from... the western countryside of Daraa" province in southern Syria. AFP
 EU leaders to hold summit on conflictBRUSSELS  European Council president Charles Michel said last Saturday that he had convened a video conference summit of European Union leaders on Tuesday to discuss the Hamas attacks on Israelis and Israel's response.
 He said the bloc stood in "full solidarity" with the people of Israel after the "brutal terrorist attacks" of a week ago.
 In an invitation letter to EU leaders, Mr Michel said the EU had to be an advocate of peace and respect for international law and should seek to avoid a regional escalation of the situation.
 He added that the conflict had the potential to feed extremism in EU societies and could prompt migration and movements of a large number of people to neighbouring countries. REUTERS
 No agreement on Israeli security CabinetJERUSALEM  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party said last Saturday that opposition politician Avigdor Lieberman had agreed to join the security Cabinet, but Mr Lieberman appeared to deny this, saying he wanted to be part of a smaller forum running the Gaza war.
 "I am willing to join the war Cabinet in order to bring about the fastest possible victory. I have no interest in being 'Minister Number 38' in the Cabinet and serve as a fig leaf," Mr Lieberman said in a social media post.
 An hour earlier, Mr Netanyahu's Likud party said he had invited Mr Lieberman and another unidentified member of the opposition politician's nationalist party to the security Cabinet. "Lieberman accepted the invitation," the statement said.
 The conservative Mr Netanyahu has been trying to broaden his government's base as Israel gears up for a possible ground invasion of Gaza. REUTERS

S'pore Mufti, Chief Rabbi exchange letters, reiterate importance of unity

Despite the differences between Jews and Muslims, peaceful coexistence can be achieved, with the religious harmony enjoyed here being an example, said the Mufti of Singapore in a letter sent to the Republic's Chief Rabbi last Friday.
 His letter, as well as the response from Rabbi Mordechai Abergel on Sunday, were shared through the Jewish Welfare Board in a Facebook post in which both religious leaders emphasised the importance of unity and solidarity amid the ongoing conflict in Israel.
 Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir in his letter, which was also posted on his Instagram account, said: "There is no place and no justification for any form of violence and brutality on civilians by anyone, including those by Hamas, or in any retaliatory response.
 "The right of civilians to live peacefully must be protected at all times."
 He added: "We offer our sincerest condolences, prayers and solidarity to those whose lives were taken unjustly, to those who have been injured and to their loved ones. May their sorrows heal and may they find peace in these troubling and challenging times."
 He noted that the conflict has a long and complex history, but pointed out that "our scriptures emphasise the human need for mercy and compassion".
 It is these qualities that ensure each community "has the basic right to believe and practise that belief, and to live peacefully in the world".
 "If these fundamental rights are under threat, it will almost certainly unleash enmity and conflict. And the greatest victim and loss in wars and conflicts is humanity itself," he said.
 In his letter, he expressed the hope that both the Jewish and Muslim communities in the conflict zones could look past political ideologies and instead live together "with a different model of respect, tolerance and harmony".
 "I hope we can share our model of coexistence with the communities in the affected regions and communicate the urgency of peaceful relations to their leaders," he added.
 In response, Rabbi Abergel told Dr Nazirudin that he was encouraged by the Mufti's letter. He said the Jewish community here is thankful for the Government's zero-tolerance policy on hate speech, religious hatred and incitement, and added that the utmost priority is for communities here to come together "in the days and weeks ahead".
 The Israel-Hamas war began after militants launched an attack on Oct 7. In what was the biggest incursion into Israel in decades, Hamas fighters killed at least 250 Israelis and took dozens of hostages during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. More than 230 Gazans were later killed after Israel began retaliatory strikes.
 As at Sunday, more than 1,400 Israelis and 2,450 Gazans have been killed. 
 The number of lives lost has been impossible to comprehend, as is the pain that grieving families are experiencing as they mourn their loved ones, said Rabbi Abergel. 
 Stressing that it is of paramount importance to further strengthen the longstanding bonds between the Jewish and Muslim communities in Singapore, even as challenges lie ahead, he said that it is very important for communities here to come together. "It is up to us and our communities to ensure that we protect and maintain the delicate fabric of our unique society which is a role model of religious tolerance and respect throughout the world," he noted.
 Expressing the sorrow experienced by the Jewish community, he added: "Our hearts and prayers are also with innocent Palestinian civilians who have lost their lives in this senseless conflict, and we do hope and pray for a peaceful and long-lasting solution to this war and a permanent peace between Israel and the Palestinian people, as elusive as it might seem at this moment."
 Dr Nazirudin said: "We fear and weep for the sad state of the human soul in this time of unprecedented violence and suffering in the world; how hatred will be entrenched in the minds of victims, how conflicts will be exploited to sow enmity between communities, how compassion and forgiveness will be replaced with anger and vengeance."
 He hoped that despite their differences, both Jews and Muslims in the conflict zones can set aside politics in pursuit of "respect, tolerance and harmony".
 He said: "I cherish the trust and confidence between our communities, where we can speak freely and candidly on what matters most to us, and work together towards commonalities that strengthen, not focus on differences that divide.
 "Our work to put forth a different model of peaceful coexistence, where every community in Singapore can live peacefully alongside other faiths and celebrate diversity, has now become even more critical."
 In response, Rabbi Abergel said: "May the darkness we are currently experiencing pave the way to light and peace for Jews and Muslims, Israelis and Palestinians. May it happen swiftly and decisively in our days."

Singapore, US to venture into new areas to boost ties: DPM Wong

WASHINGTON  The United States will continue to play a dominant role in the world in the foreseeable future and Singapore will expand bilateral ties into new areas such as emerging technologies, outer space exploration and green energy, said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong.
 Speaking on Friday at the end of his 10-day visit to the US, Mr Wong noted that defence and security have always been key pillars of the relationship, and said Singapore seeks to go beyond these traditional areas. 
 "We have launched a dialogue on critical and emerging technologies. We are looking at how we can do more in terms of exploration in outer space; we are looking at cooperation in green energy solutions," he said. He added that the US and Singapore are also working together to jointly deliver technical assistance to countries in the Pacific Islands region.
 While conceding that an increasingly multipolar world will make for more complexity, Mr Wong said the US will retain its primacy. 
 "There is China rising, there is India, there is Asean, so it will become a more complex environment. But the US will still be a dominant pole in this equation for quite some time to come," he said in a 30-minute interview with the Singapore media. 
 Calling the testy Washington-Beijing relationship the key issue of the day, Mr Wong noted that it had evolved since his visit to China in May, with both sides saying they do not want confrontation. 
 "It will be very useful for both sides to be able to rebuild the strategic trust that is needed to take the relationship forward," he said, adding that Singapore could be a facilitator.
 Hopes have been raised for a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' summit to be held in San Francisco in November.
 "That is what we hope for, and to the extent that we can, we will try and do our part to facilitate this positive direction in the relationship," Mr Wong said.
 He dismissed talk of America's decline. 
 "When I was a student here in the early 90s, there were already fears that Japan would overtake the US. But look what has happened since then. The US economy has remained remarkably strong and resilient," he said.
 "If, as a student in 1990, I had put US$100 in the S&P 500, I would be earning a lot of money today. If I had put that same US$100 in any other stock market anywhere else in the world, it would not have achieved the same amount of returns." 
 Will the US continue to outperform the rest of the world? Mr Wong said the chances are good.
 "Past performance is not a predictor of future success. But when you look at the underlying drivers of the US' economic engine -- the cutting-edge research that they have, the best universities in the world being in the US, the open society that attracts talent from everywhere around the world -- I think these are all important drivers of the US' innovation, growth and prosperity," he said. 
 "For the foreseeable future, at least, I think the US will continue to have a very strong leading position. And that is why we value and appreciate the very close relationship that we have with the US across many different areas."
 Mr Wong said there is a "full agenda ahead" for US-Singapore relations. 
 "We have a deep reservoir of strategic trust between the two sides, and that enables us to continue to find very useful ways of partnership and collaboration in the years to come," he added.
 During his visit, Mr Wong had substantive meetings with senior members of the Biden administration, covering a wide range of issues from national security to economics to finance, "reflecting the strong and multifaceted nature of our cooperation with the US", a statement from Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said.
 Among others, Mr Wong met National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Trade Representative Katherine Tai and National Economic Council director Lael Brainard.
 The US is the largest foreign direct investor in Singapore, with an investment stock worth $421.8 billion in 2022. Its investment in Singapore is larger than American investment in China, Japan and South Korea combined. Singapore is the third-largest Asian investor in the US, after Japan and South Korea, with investment stock valued at US$57.5 billion (S$78.8 billion) in 2022. 
 During his discussions in Washington, Mr Wong reiterated Singapore's commitment to green energy and net zero emissions by 2050 despite being an alternative-energy disadvantaged nation. Singapore is exploring all options to decarbonise its power sector, including emerging technologies like low-carbon hydrogen, and advanced geothermal energy systems.
 "In this context, DPM Wong expressed Singapore's interest to cooperate with the US to explore the possible role of civilian nuclear energy in the green energy transition," the MFA statement said.
 In his remarks to the media, Mr Wong said Singapore did not have any easy way to get to net zero because it did not have the means to deploy renewable energy at scale. 
 "Solar, we do not have enough land; wind and tidal, these are not options for us," he said.
 "It is all very preliminary and at a very exploratory stage because we have not made any decisions," he said about Singapore studying civilian nuclear energy. 
 "Because the technology is evolving and you see newer, safer nuclear options evolving, we would like to study these, not preclude them at this early juncture, and build up capacity in this area. So that is one of the new specific areas that we are looking at to collaborate with the US."
 Answering a question on the situation in Gaza, where Israel is preparing to launch "a significant ground operation" in response to an attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas, Mr Wong said the safety and security of civilians are an urgent priority. The war has claimed more than 3,500 lives since Hamas launched attacks on Oct 7
 "The US and regional partners are also trying very hard to prevent an escalation of the situation so that you do not end up with a wider conflict that involves other countries in the Middle East," he said.
 Singapore is watching the situation very closely, and an escalation will impact South-east Asia and Singapore too. "On the economic front, you could have implications for oil, disruptions in supplies of energy, and that will impact the economy," Mr Wong said.
 "On the security front, you could have extremist and terrorist groups who are trying to exploit the situation. You already see wider calls for a jihad against Israel. That is very dangerous and we know that Singapore can be a very attractive target," he said, adding that Singapore is stepping up security measures to ensure external events do not impact its peace and harmony built up over decades.

War has unexpectedly intensified in Israel and Gaza. Many more Israelis and Palestinians will die as the conflict persists ('Sea of bodies' in Israel, scores dead in Gaza as shock Hamas attack unleashes war, Oct 8). 
 This crisis deeply saddens me and reminds me of how important it is for us to defend our country in troubled times. Like Israel, Singapore is a small nation. Though Singaporeans have enjoyed peace for many years, we still face many threats, known and unknown. We, especially the young, should never take this peace for granted.
 Those like me who are too young to participate in national service (NS) can defend our country in many other ways, big and small. We can learn more about NS from our fathers and teachers. We can also actively read the news to stay informed about regional developments and debunk fake news to stay vigilant, and share what we have learnt with our family and friends.
 My older brother is in the army, and I feel proud of him. Let us do our part for total defence, for Singapore to remain a safe and secure home.

JERUSALEM Israel has resumed the water supply to southern Gaza, Energy Minister Israel Katz said on Sunday, as one million people evacuated the north of the Strip to escape a massive air assault.
 "This will push the civilian population to the southern (part of the) Strip," Mr Katz said in a statement, a week after Israel stopped supplying water to the entire territory as part of a "complete siege" on the Palestinian enclave.
 He said the decision to resume supply was taken after talks between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden. AFP 
 Only PLO represents Palestinians: AbbasCARACAS -- Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the actions and policies of Islamist group Hamas do not represent the Palestinian people, according to official news agency Wafa.
 In a phone call with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Mr Abbas also said the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) was the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people". 
 "The President affirmed his rejection of the killing of civilians on both sides and called for the release of civilians, prisoners and detainees on both sides," added the news agency. REUTERS
 Middle East on verge of abyss: UN chief UNITED NATIONS United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday called for Hamas to release all hostages and for Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, warning that the Middle East was "on the verge of the abyss".
 "Gaza is running out of water, electricity and other essential supplies," Mr Guterres said in a statement.
 UN stocks of food, water, medical supplies and fuel in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Israel "can be dispatched within hours", he continued, adding that staff "need to be able to bring these supplies into and throughout Gaza safely, and without impediment".
 He also called for Hamas to release hostages "immediately" and "without conditions".
 "Each one of these two objectives are valid in themselves. They should not become bargaining chips, and they must be implemented because it is the right thing to do," said Mr Guterres. AFP
 TikTok acts to curb misinformationBRUSSELS Short video app TikTok said on Sunday it had mobilised resources and personnel to counter hate and misinformation emerging after Palestinian Islamist group Hamas' attack on Israel.
 European Union industry chief Thierry Breton last Thursday gave TikTok 24 hours to detail measures taken to counter the spread of disinformation related to the Middle East conflict. 
 TikTok said its actions included launching a command centre, enhancing its automated detection systems to remove graphic and violent content, and adding more moderators who speak Arabic and Hebrew.  REUTERS

The US diplomatic battle to avert a bigger Gaza conflict

Immediate prospects for the Middle East are grim: Ahead lies weeks, perhaps even months, of serious bloodshed as Israel hits back at Hamas for its killing of more than 1,300 Israelis, and the fate of around 2.2 million civilians in Gaza hangs in the balance.
 Yet behind what appears to be a choice of only hopelessly bleak scenarios, the United States and its key regional allies are engaged in intense rounds of negotiations designed to lay the foundation of a radically transformed Middle East that is sure to emerge after the current fighting stops.
 Of course, many of these plans may come to nothing; the region's history is littered with good ideas which remained just that. Still, the fact remains that the current fighting has also revived diplomatic interest in the Middle East. So, while most of the world's attention remains fixed on the activities of Israel's fighter jets striking Gaza, the flight trajectory of one other aircraft -- used by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, hopping from one Middle Eastern capital to another -- also deserves careful watching.
 Hamas' deadly strike at Israel is rightly presented as a colossal intelligence failure for Israel. But it's worth noting that Israel's lack of preparedness and neglect of the Palestinians were hardly unique.
 Governments worldwide grew bored with endless proposals for a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, the so-called Middle East Peace Process which, because it was touted for decades, was no longer about peace or any recognisable process.
 Other crises -- such as growing military tensions between the US and China, Russia's invasion of Ukraine or the need to combat inflation and promote economic growth after the Covid-19 pandemic -- attracted most of the world's diplomatic attention. "Pivoting away" from the Middle East by downgrading the region's strategic importance seemed appropriate, given the circumstances. 
 It's in part why the US currently does not have an ambassador in Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, Oman or Kuwait. Benign neglect is also why the current US administration has failed to appoint a coordinator for economic aid to the Middle East in nearly three years, and why the position of State Department coordinator for counter-terrorism -- one would have thought an otherwise critical job -- has remained unfilled for almost two years.
 More significantly, while US President Joe Biden and his officials were hardly pleased with the return to power of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his motley group of far-right extremists bent on destroying any chance for the creation of a Palestinian state, the Biden administration strangely bought into Mr Netanyahu's narrative that the Palestinians were no longer a priority and that the Middle East could be made safe by just encouraging the "normalisation" of Israel's diplomatic relations with its Arab neighbours.
 This air of complacency was neatly encapsulated by Mr Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser who, days before Hamas struck, confidently told US journalists that "the Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades". He added, in words sure to haunt him, that "the Gaza border seems to have stabilised after some unrest".
 So, although Israel's intelligence failure remains both monumental and inexcusable, this happened within the context of a general loss of imagination and shallow understanding of the Middle East from which most other governments -- particularly that of the US -- suffered.
 Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that the Biden administration reacted to the present crisis with surprising agility.
 President Biden's speeches in which he characterised Hamas' deadly attack as "pure, unadulterated evil" and his repeated pledges to offer "rock solid and unwavering support" to Israel were dismissed by many of America's critics as yet another example of the country's blinkered alliance with Israel.
 Reassurance and restraintBut that's a very superficial interpretation of what, in reality, is a reasonably sophisticated US approach to handling both Israel and the current crisis.
 The Americans, as well as the leaders of key European countries such as Britain, France and Germany, start from the assumption that the Hamas attack and the large number of casualties inflicted have been a profound, transformative shock for Israel. 
 Trying to tell the Israelis what to do -- or preaching tolerance to Israel's military in its operations in Gaza -- can be counterproductive, the thinking goes.
 The nation is traumatised by what has happened, with many of its politicians likening the Hamas massacres to the start of the Nazi-led Holocaust in which six million Jews perished during World War II. However much one may consider this comparison an exaggeration, the Americans and Europeans have concluded -- probably rightly -- that their best hope of influencing Israel is by supporting the Israelis' right to self-defence rather than belittling their objectives.
 This balancing act was clearly evident in Mr Biden's remarks on Sunday in a CBS interview, in which he said it would be "a big mistake" for the Israelis to reoccupy Gaza even as he endorsed the goal of going after Hamas. "Israel has to respond," Mr Biden said. Taking out extremists "is a necessary requirement".
 American expressions of support are not just a matter of words. Its deployment of two aircraft carrier groups near the shores of Israel has a very practical purpose: preventing Iran from encouraging the expansion of war against Israel by pushing Hezbollah, the mighty Iranian proxy militia in Lebanon, to join the fray against Israel. 
 The US effort to deter Iran reduces the potential for a broader regional war. It also enhances America's ability to persuade Israel to be careful about what it does in Gaza.
 If the Israelis had to worry about the imminent prospect of an attack by Hezbollah in the north while they dealt with Hamas in Gaza in the south, Israel's armed forces would have had to rush through the Gaza fighting, potentially resulting in an even more significant number of civilian casualties. As things stand, the US reassurance against the danger of a second front opening in the north means that the Israelis can take longer and exercise greater care in Gaza.
 As US and European officials have asserted publicly and privately to Israeli officials, they expect the Israeli military to use their force judiciously against Gaza and its civilian population. This is both a matter of respect for international law and in Israel's direct strategic interest, for the higher the number of civilian casualties, the harder it would be for Israel's allies to defend it against international pressure to stop the fighting before it achieved its objective of removing Hamas' grip on Gaza.
 However, the problem for all of Israel's backers is that the letter of international law increasingly differs from what public opinion believes are the requirements of international humanitarian law.
 Since Hamas rules Gaza, attacked Israel from Gaza, took hostages back to Gaza and is now hiding in Gaza, there is no question that Israel has the legal right to strike back against that territory.
 And, contrary to prevailing popular opinion, international law does not forbid the killing of civilians; what it prohibits is the deliberate targeting of civilians or the disproportionate use of force against civilians. Since Hamas makes no secret that it is hiding among Gaza's civilian population, a good case can be made that Israel is entitled to hit built-up areas.
 That is precisely what both Western and Arab forces did in 2016 when they took on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Care was taken not to target civilians deliberately. But major Iraqi cities such as Ramadi, Fallujah and Mosul were laid waste with the deaths of thousands of civilians, with zero international protests. And it is largely forgotten that the allies in that war also bombed in December 2016 the main hospital in Mosul as it was used by ISIS to manufacture explosives.
 The most challenging task which lies ahead for US and European diplomats is how to defend Israel's military actions in Gaza in the days and weeks to come, while at the same time quietly urging restraint on the Israelis'part. And this job is made much trickier when public perceptions are very different from the reality of international law, which grants Israel far greater room for manoeuvre.
 After the fighting stopsBeyond this, the Americans are particularly preparing for the intensive diplomacy the Middle East will need after the fighting stops.
 Few US officials believe that Israel would succeed in "eliminating" Hamas, as PM Netanyahu continues to promise. Still, American diplomats are keen to use the lull following the dismantling of Hamas' structures in Gaza to put in place an alternative and more moderate Palestinian administration for Gaza, perhaps with the help of a multinational Arab "peacekeeping force".
 That will require the cooperation of neighbouring Egypt which, like Israel, is also keeping Gaza under quarantine. But it will also necessitate a new Palestinian leadership to replace the current Palestinian Authority ruling in the West Bank, which is perceived as being both corrupt and ineffectual.
 A mere pipe dream with no chance of being realised? Not entirely. US officials privately assume that the disaster which hit Israel has also curtailed the political career of Mr Netanyahu. While the Israeli leader is a wily politician with an excellent record of evading personal responsibility, nobody can see how he can shake off responsibility for the result of this massive intelligence failure.
 So, a change of government in Israel is very much on the cards after this war is over, and according to current opinion polls, Mr Netanyahu and his associates are likely to be crushed in any forthcoming ballot. His departure could mean the end of Israel's old policy of encouraging a fight between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, hoping to keep the Palestinians divided.
 That policy has contributed to the disaster today, and there are good chances that a future Israeli government would be interested in returning to the negotiating table with a reinvigorated Palestinian Authority, if only because the alternatives are too awful to contemplate. 
 This is the plan that Mr Blinken is trying to sell to all pro-Western capitals in the Middle East. And although every Arab leader -- from the Egyptian President to the monarchs of Jordan and further afield in the Gulf -- feels the need to blame Israel in public for the current war, all of them have a stake in seeing Hamas disappear, and all hope that this will come about. Therefore, Mr Blinken's diplomatic agenda cannot be dismissed as just a pipe dream.
 Still, the snag remains that, as is often the case in the Middle East, matters are likely to get worse in the coming weeks before there is the faintest glint of a better future.

The Republic is deeply distressed by the increasing civilian casualty toll and deepening humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).
 They have arisen from Israeli military operations in response to the attacks by Hamas on Israel on Oct 7. 
 In a statement on Monday, MFA said: "Hamas deliberately targeted civilians, murdering and kidnapping them, and perpetrating abhorrent acts of terror. These atrocities cannot be justified by any rationale. We call for the immediate and safe release of all civilians taken hostage by Hamas."
 MFA added that Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens and its territory.
 "However, in exercising this right, Israel must comply with international law, including the laws of war," it said. "It must do its utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians.
 "We urge all parties to abide by international humanitarian law and allow for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip."
 In response to the urgent humanitarian situation, the Singapore Government will contribute $300,000 to humanitarian relief operations through the Singapore Red Cross. 
 "Tragically, too many lives on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been lost in repeated cycles of violence over many decades," said MFA. 
 It reiterated that Singapore has long held the position that the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive resolution to the longstanding conflict is a negotiated two-state solution consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
 "(Singapore) is convinced that this remains the case. It urges both sides to take steps towards this ultimate goal, despite the recent and ongoing hostilities and the difficulty of the task. Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve to live in peace, security and dignity," it added.
 On Oct 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip that killed at least 1,400 people.
 In return, Israel declared "a state of war" and launched retaliatory strikes. The authorities in Gaza said at least 2,750 people have so far been killed by the Israeli strikes, a quarter of them children, and nearly 10,000 wounded. A further 1,000 people were missing and believed to be under rubble.
 Casualties are expected to rise as Israel prepares for a ground assault on the tiny, densely populated enclave that could start within days.

How Hamas caught powerful Israel Defence Forces off-guard

Body


Sunrise in Israel on Oct 7 was at 6.36am. It was the start of the Sabbath and a national holiday, with Israel Defence Forces (IDF) forces on the Gaza border expecting a quiet weekend. 
 Minutes before, Hamas had unleashed its biggest artillery barrage in the past two years deep into Israeli territory, in south and central Israel including Tel Aviv. The intensity overwhelmed the IDF's Iron Dome defences.
 In the attack codenamed Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Hamas simultaneously moved hundreds of militants in broad daylight, eschewing the protection that the cover of darkness might afford. 
 Operating in daytime when they knew the IDF had air superiority shows the extent to which Hamas was confident it had duped the Israelis. Apart from the advantage of springing a surprise attack at dawn when the human mind is least alert, moving in daylight allowed drone operators to see their targets and paragliders to fly without night vision devices. 
 In the air, dozens of terrorists from the Saqr (Arabic for "Falcon") assault squads infiltrated using paragliders in unprecedented numbers. Hamas also claimed it launched 35 Zouari kamikaze drones -- a new weapon named after the Tunisian engineer who introduced drones to Hamas. Zouari operators likely used the video camera on the explosive-laden drones to turn them into crude precision guided weapons to knock out high-value targets like IDF command and control facilities. 
 Meanwhile, dozens of cheap drones dropped bombs on the Sentry Tech gun towers and communications towers so crucial for the IDF's networked defences.
 On the ground, combat engineers stormed the Iron Wall with explosive charges to blow holes in the fence. Once it was breached, terrorists on motorcycles raced into Israel to kill or capture hostages. 
 At the same time, bulldozers rumbled out of their hiding places near the border to enlarge the openings for truckloads of militants. More than 1,500 are said to have got through the 29 openings
 Hamas' statement that it had captured enough IDF soldiers and civilians to free all Palestinians jailed in Israel suggests a cold calculus from an October 2011 prisoner swop when a single IDF soldier captured by Hamas, Gilad Shalit, was exchanged for over a thousand Palestinians. 
 But Israel's punishing response to Al-Aqsa Flood shows a serious miscalculation by Hamas. The dent to Israel's deterrent posture and the danger that 10/7 might inspire future attacks explain why Israel is exacting a heavy price on the aggressor to restore deterrence.
 The failure of deterrenceThe series of thoroughly planned and highly organised attacks by Hamas shattered the aura of invincibility surrounding the battle-hardened IDF. Having earned a reputation as the most capable and best equipped military in the Middle East with a high level of operational readiness, the IDF should have easily deterred aggression and invasion of its borders. 
 Just two years ago, the IDF had completed the building of a 65km fence along the Israel-Gaza border, dubbed the Iron Wall, at a cost of US$1.1 billion (S$1.5 billion). The barrier's 6m-high fence was protected by unmanned remote-controlled guns and was watched by hundreds of sensors like cameras, motion detectors and radars.
 While the Iron Wall is a recent addition, many Sentry Tech towers armed with the remote-controlled guns were installed in 2008, years before the decision to strengthen the border. Hamas might have had some 15 years to probe the weakness and capabilities of these towers. At some point, the militants also assessed they could breach the Iron Wall.
 The attack on the IDF's Re'im camp, home to the IDF's Gaza division, added to the fog of war. Its loss crippled IDF efforts to make sense of the surprise attack, possibly contributing to the delay in sending IDF forces to border towns, and gave Hamas terrorists time to slaughter hundreds of people and take hostages.
 The years-long deceptionHamas' deadly campaign planning likely started much earlier. A Hamas spokesman revealed after the attack that efforts to deceive Israel began some two years ago. Hamas pretended to focus on economic matters and scaled down attacks on Israel. 
 The image of a passive, conflict-averse Hamas, seemingly focused on governing instead of taking down Israel, could have contributed to the IDF's decision to shift units from southern Israel to counter unrest in the West Bank -- a move which Hamas no doubt noticed.
 In the days, months and years ahead, much ink will be spilled on dissecting one of the biggest intelligence failures of our time and how much was missed possibly because of false assumptions, complacency and other factors.  
 Reports indicate that the IDF picked up Hamas training in plain sight months before the attack. But Hamas was not thought capable of executing the complex level of combined arms integration seen on that black day. 
 And while numerous videos from the war in Ukraine have demonstrated how cheap drones could take out enemy targets, the vulnerability of the Iron Wall's networked sensors to drone attack seems to have eluded IDF planners. This lapse is puzzling as the IDF was a pioneer in the use of drones in war and had employed them innovatively in many battles. 
 The IDF's incapacitation and the rapid collapse of its high-tech border defences when attacked are serious shortcomings that will preoccupy Israeli analysts for some time to come.
 Readiness to surprise attacksThe failure of Israeli front-line defences during the 10/7 attacks by Hamas militants holds important lessons for all nations that want to avoid a repeat of this horrific tragedy. Writing from Singapore, I asked myself, "Could a 10/7 happen here'" 
 If Singapore faced an unforeseen threat, hostile elements will find that the Lion City is no soft target. As you read this, the Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) standby units are on duty, armed and ready for immediate deployment. 
 Recent activations of Republic of Singapore Air Force fighters for air intrusions and bomb threats to airliners show just one aspect of the SAF's standby force, whose size and composition is classified. The Singapore Army has units ready round the clock as a counter-attack force, while the Republic of Singapore Navy maintains a close watch on our sea lanes.
 The SAF's track record in past operations has been exemplary. No-notice deployments such as Operation Steeplejack, launched to protect oil refineries during the 1990 Gulf War, the swift commando action during Operation Thunderbolt that ended the hijacking of Singapore Airlines Flight SQ117 in March 1991, and the evacuation of Singaporeans from civil unrest in Cambodia using air force transport aircraft during Operation Crimson Angel in July 1997 are just a few examples of the SAF's responses to security challenges that emerged suddenly. 
 My sense is the SAF is under no illusions it will never face surprise attacks, which by definition come with no warning. Defences might fail during a first clash with an enemy that appears suddenly. But they should be designed to fail safely, with multiple redundancies to hedge against catastrophic failure, thus allowing defenders to rapidly deploy standby units to regain the initiative.
 The SAF's fail-safe mantra is perhaps best seen during the National Day Parade, when the Chinook helicopter flying the Singapore flag is backed up by not one, but as many as two identical choppers with their own giant flags. You can be assured a similar approach is taken for serious operational situations, whereby the loss of a weapon system or commander or unit will be mitigated by a fail-safe that guards against a catastrophic failure.
 A fail-safe approachSurprise attacks, especially those that involve elaborate ruses, have bedevilled military forces since the days of the Trojan horse, and require militaries to constantly evolve and adapt to a changing security landscape. 
 The transformation of the SAF into a third-generation fighting force with advanced, networked combat capabilities -- a journey it embarked on in 2004 -- represents Singapore's approach to keep its deterrent edge sharp. 
 The formation of the SAF Digital and Intelligence Service, raised as a fourth service in October 2022 with personnel from the army, navy and air force, reflects moves by Singapore's military to promote sharing between intelligence assets by breaking down institutional silos and giving the SAF an integrated, comprehensive situational picture.
 The establishment of the SAF Special Operations Task Force, which groups elite units like counter-terrorist forces under a joint command, and the Island Defence Task Force in 2009 and 2010 respectively show the SAF's transformation to deal with new or emerging security situations is a continuous journey that must be improved and strengthened as new threats emerge.
 And ultimately, what counts is honing the mindset of all SAF personnel to be prepared for the unexpected, never to underrate one's opponent, and to train hard in realistic scenarios. 
 The 10/7 tragedy is a chilling reminder that some hostile minds are undeterrable. If Israel's network of advanced sensors and combat-proven war machines can be challenged by terrorists who bet that they can exploit security vulnerabilities, the same might happen to Singapore. 
 This is why efforts to fight complacency, especially after Singaporeans enjoyed decades of peace and prosperity, and never deluding ourselves that the unthinkable can never happen must always be works in progress under the Total Defence banner.
 News portal Breaking Defense put it succinctly with this observation from Mr Bilal Saab, senior fellow and director of the defence and security programme at the Middle East Institute, who said of the Oct 7 attacks: "Over-reliance on tech always has its drawbacks. But the problem here wasn't tech. There was a failure of imagination, first and foremost, and total disrespect for the opponent."
 While it will take time for defence analysts to piece together the full story of 10/7, the military disaster is a sobering reminder -- so often dismissed as cliche -- that the price of peace is eternal vigilance.

Israel-Hamas war and the dangers of a creeping occupation

Body


US President Joe Biden has warned Israel that occupying Gaza "would be a big mistake". The warning seemed to be aimed directly at voices within the Israeli government who are calling for Israel to not only destroy Hamas, but also to occupy the Palestinian territory.
 Mr Biden supports Israel's right to defend itself and to destroy Hamas' military capabilities. But, if history is anything to go by, then occupation -- as a strategy to destroy Hamas -- seems doomed to fail. 
 The Gaza Strip was under Israeli  occupation following the June 1967 war (it was earlier occupied by Egypt) until Israel  withdrew from the territory in 2005. This included the removal of 21 settlements comprising 8,500 Israeli civilians who were living amid 1.4 million Palestinians. 
 The realities of occupationThe occupation of Gaza required the diversion of significant military and economic resources to protect the settlers in a land with which most Israelis did not feel a sense of kinship. Polls from 2004 and 2005 of Israeli public opinion showed that between 53 per cent and 60 per cent supported the disengagement plan.
 Indeed, the recent Hamas attacks are a painful reminder of the occupation's costs. In response to rising tensions in recent weeks in the West Bank and East Jerusalem (both occupied by Israel since 1967 and previously under Jordanian occupation), the Israeli army diverted its entire Gaza division to protect Israeli settlers in the West Bank and to prevent a deadly escalation there over the Jewish holidays. This left the Israeli military significantly under-equipped and under-manned to respond immediately and decisively to the Hamas attacks from Gaza.
 Already burdened by policing missions around Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and with the ever-present threat of a military confrontation with Hezbollah (the Iranian-backed Shi'ite militia group established in the early 1980s) along its northern border, the notion of a military reoccupation of Gaza by Israel would probably see its resources stretched not only beyond capacity, but also beyond its long-term interests.
 The Israeli government's stated aims for its current operation have  been vague. "Destroying Hamas' military capabilities" may mean different things to different people -- from the precise targeting of its arms and the killing of its military leaders, to destroying Hamas as an idea.
 What occupation cannot solveMilitary occupation is unlikely to kill the violent Hamas ideology. Indeed, it was the first Palestinian popular uprising (intifada) against the Israeli occupation in the West Bank which gave rise to Hamas in 1987, as a younger, Islamist alternative to the Fatah leadership. 
 Fatah, the dominant faction of the Palestinian Authority (PA) which administers the Palestinian areas in the West Bank, is a secular, nationalist party that recognises Israel -- whereas Hamas does not.
 So any sustained military occupation of Gaza is likely to garner more support for Hamas. It is also unlikely that the PA in the West Bank would be eager to fill the power vacuum which would be created in the unlikely event that Israel successfully eradicates Hamas altogether, for fear of being depicted as Israeli collaborators by the Palestinian people. 
 Moreover, an occupation brings with it the responsibility of administering the daily lives of 2.3 million Palestinians. This is something that neither Israel nor the PA wants or can do in the current circumstances.
 Lessons from 1982Israeli leaders should also take lessons from the last time the country tried to eradicate a terrorist group and impose regime change.
 In 1982, the Israeli military invaded southern Lebanon to remove the threat of the Palestine Liberation Organisation  to its northern towns. It ended with a failed alliance with the Christian Phalange party in Lebanon, which directly led to the Sabra and Shatila massacre and an 18-year Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, ending with a "chaotic" withdrawal in 2000. 
 None of Israel's options to achieve its aim of destroying Hamas' military capabilities is easy. Relying solely on air strikes will lead to a large number of civilian casualties, and is unlikely to destroy Hamas' tunnels or kill its military leaders.
 A ground operation will not only lead to a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented proportions, but is also likely to start a creeping, short-term occupation leading to a permanent occupation -- as the history of the June 1967 and 1982 Lebanon wars shows.
 Since its military and civilian withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, and following Hamas' takeover of the territory from Fatah in 2007, Israel has blockaded the strip for security reasons by air, land and sea, effectively controlling who and what is allowed to enter and leave. Egypt has similarly blockaded the southern border of the Gaza Strip by Rafah.
 While Israel no longer occupies Gaza -- inasmuch as it is not responsible for the daily lives of Gazans -- the continuous blockade has significantly contributed to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the strip. That Hamas has proven to be a more capable terrorist organisation than an effective government has only set the Palestinian quest for freedom and statehood back even further.

Biden's Israel visit is a high-risk, high-reward endeavour

Body


LONDON  US President Joe Biden's decision to visit Israel just as it is poised to launch a massive ground invasion of Gaza is designed to signal America's extensive diplomatic involvement in managing the current Middle East crisis.
 For although Mr Biden's visit is officially presented as an effort to "reaffirm the United States' solidarity with Israel and our ironclad commitment to its security" -- as Secretary of State Antony Blinken put it -- the American President's trip serves two very specific strategic purposes: to lean on the Israelis to be careful in their Gaza intervention and to deter Iran. 
 It's an unprecedented personal diplomatic mission fraught with grave danger.
 There are valid reasons why US presidents rarely engage in direct shuttle diplomacy during international crises.
 The American political system works best when the president remains in the White House, receiving the best intelligence and mediating between the options offered to him by competing advisers and government agencies.
 Today's technology also means that intensive discussions with world leaders can be held remotely at a moment's notice. The fact that such meetings are not face to face -- and do not necessarily need to be made public -- is a huge bonus.
 Besides, there is a substantial advantage in using envoys such as the secretary of state or the president's national security adviser to act as the main shuttlers in crisis management. 
 If the envoys succeed in brokering a deal, the glory goes to the president; if they fail, the president can still try other measures without losing face.
 So why is it that after a week of letting Mr Blinken do all the exhausting flying between Middle Eastern capitals, Mr Biden is breaking with decades of American crisis-management practice by boarding his own Air Force One'
 It could partly be explained by the realisation that the President's personal intervention is vital to any American diplomatic effort to avert a broader and more destructive war in the Middle East.
 The US administration understands the trauma experienced by Israel after more than 1,400 of its citizens -- mostly civilians -- were murdered in an incursion by Hamas militants. 
 Washington, therefore, accepts that Israel has to strike back against Hamas.
 However, the Americans are anxious to limit the mounting toll of Palestinian civilian casualties. And they are also trying to persuade the Israelis that a desire for revenge -- however understandable -- is no substitute for political strategy.
 Mr Blinken has privately pressed Israel over the past week to say what its strategy will be for the day after it completes its stated goal of "eliminating" Hamas.
 But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has provided no convincing answer, heightening US fears that Israeli troops would get bogged down in Gaza, only to see Hamas and other extremists return to the territory after Israel withdraws.
 Mr Blinken wants Israel to couple its offensive with the creation of humanitarian corridors in Gaza to minimise civilian casualties and an Israeli outreach to the Palestinian Authority, the moderate alternative to Hamas.
 President Biden's engagement is designed to put additional pressure on Israel to devise a political plan before its heavy tanks roll into Gaza.
 And while he is engaged in the most public display of US support for Israel just as it is about to embark on a war, Mr Biden's planned meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is calculated to reinforce the point that a political process to address the Palestinians' plight is inevitable.
 Mr Biden's presence in the region also aims to deter Iran from activating Hezbollah, its powerful militia based in Lebanon, which has frequently threatened to open a second front against Israel.
 The US has been sending such warning signals for a week -- two US aircraft carrier groups are approaching the Israeli coastline in a very explicit message to Iran that if it sends its Hezbollah proxies into a war, it must expect to face not only the Israeli but also the US military.
 Still, increasingly bellicose pronouncements from Iran -- including a Monday statement from Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who threatened that if the Israelis "are not stopped immediately, new fronts will be opened for them" -- are worrying the Americans that their message of resolve is not taken seriously in Teheran.
 President Biden's trip -- and especially his planned meetings with Jordan's King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi -- is meant to send an explicit warning to Iran that the US has plenty of allies and resolve to contain Iranian influence. 
 The snag for Mr Biden is that his trip remains a high-risk, high-reward enterprise. 
 If he succeeds in locking Israel into a more serious dialogue with moderate Palestinians and limiting the scope of the Israeli military operation, some good may come out of the current wretched situation.
 But if Mr Biden fails, the US may well run out of diplomatic options and end up being dragged by the Iranians into a more extensive regional war.

After the Hamas attacks and Israeli reprisals, now what'
The Straits Times (Singapore)

Byline: Vikram Khanna Associate Editor &, After the Hamas attacks and Israeli reprisals, now what'
Body


In his 1989 book From Beirut To Jerusalem, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote that "when you think about the Middle East, you must consider what happens the morning after the morning after".
 The region has long been the theatre of dramatic events -- wars, uprisings, massacres and other tragedies -- but each has evolved and morphed and had ripple effects, sometimes of wider geopolitical significance. 
 For example, the Yom Kippur war of 1973 in which Egypt and Syria mounted a surprise attack on Israel profoundly impacted the politics of the Middle East, leading eventually to a peace treaty between the sworn enemies Israel and Egypt in 1979 and Cairo's tilt away from the Soviet Union to the United States. But not all events have had positive outcomes, as the aftershocks of the Arab Spring of 2011 demonstrated in countries like Syria and Libya.
 Now we are witnessing another catastrophic event, which is being described as "Israel's 9/11", which could also have far-reaching consequences that, at this stage, are a matter of speculation.
 What is clear at this point is events have moved at a rapid clip since the horror of the Oct 7 attack by Hamas fighters on communities in Israel near its border with Gaza, which the militant group controls. At least 1,300 people were killed at a music festival, in their homes and on the streets. Some 200 others were seized and taken to Gaza as hostages.
 Since then Israel has blockaded Gaza and launched thousands of air strikes as it prepares for a ground invasion of Gaza to "wipe out" Hamas. Over 2,800 people have been killed in the bombardment. Meanwhile, external actors are being drawn into the picture. US President Joe Biden is to visit Israel on Wednesday, while Iran, the main backer of Hamas, has warned of "pre-emptive action" against the Israelis.  
 So now, we are already in the "morning after the morning after" phase of this unfolding tragedy. How might the situation evolve as Israeli tanks and infantry mass on the border with Gaza in preparation for a massive land offensive, the US positions its warships in nearby waters, while Israeli villagers near the Lebanese border are being evacuated for fear of Hezbollah fighters opening a new front? 
 Hazards of a land invasionA land invasion of Gaza, as part of a scorched-earth policy on the part of Israel, would be calamitous. It would involve hand-to-hand, building-to-building fighting which would lead to massive loss of lives among all those involved, including both Hamas militants whom Israel wants to crush and Israeli soldiers and reservists, with civilians caught in the crossfire. 
 The presence of Israeli hostages -- probably in multiple locations within Gaza -- will further complicate the Israeli operation.
 Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe, which is already serious with food and water running out, tens of thousands rendered homeless, and hospitals overwhelmed, will intensify. Israel will find it difficult to administer a hostile and beleaguered population in whatever remains of Gaza after Hamas is neutralised.
 In the end, Hamas will be bloodied but may not be defeated. Even if it is, other militant groups in Gaza, such as Islamic Jihad and Lion's Den, will take its place. Israel could end up playing whack-a-mole with extremists in the territory.
 Risks of a wider conflictAnd maybe beyond. Hezbollah -- another militant group based in Lebanon that is sympathetic to the Palestinian cause -- has already started shooting mortars and missiles into Israel from the north. If it intensifies its attacks, Israel could be forced into a two-front war, not by choice but by necessity. Hezbollah, which is bigger, better funded and more heavily armed than Hamas, may see Israel's preoccupation with Gaza as an opportunity. Other militant groups in Lebanon and Syria could also get involved.
 Iran, as the biggest patron of both Hamas and Hezbollah, which it has funded, trained and supplied, could also get sucked into a wider conflict, even if indirectly. Although there is so far no evidence that Iran was involved in the attacks on Israel by Hamas -- both its government and Hamas have denied this -- the risks of a conflict between Israel and Iran have risen.
 Many analysts point out that Iran stands to benefit strategically from Israel's war on Hamas. It would have viewed with concern Israel's growing rapprochement particularly with Saudi Arabia but also with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain as well as Morocco and Sudan through the 2020 Abraham Accords, which were brokered by the US. Such an alliance between Israel and Sunni-ruled states would have posed a threat to Teheran-backed Palestinian groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, thereby reducing Iran's influence in the region, while solidifying Israel's position.
 Hamas, as well as the Palestinian Authority which rules the West Bank, criticised the Abraham Accords because they did not address the core issue of the rights of Palestinians and Israel's occupation of what they claim as their territories. 
 A political turn in  the Middle EastThe attacks by Hamas, which have forced Israel to react with extreme force against Gaza, may change the emerging political configuration in the Middle East. As the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza unfolds and is broadcast on television and social media, protests against Israel, especially throughout the Muslim world, are likely to grow. This would force Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to rethink their rapprochement with Israel. The future of this process is now in doubt. 
 Tellingly, since the Hamas attacks and Israeli reprisals, Saudi Arabia has issued statements speaking up for the Palestinians, which it had long refrained from doing. Last Friday, it sharply criticised Israel's demand for Palestinians to leave Gaza City and condemned the continued targeting of "defenceless civilians". The issue of Palestinian rights, which had faded amid Israel's overtures to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, is now front and centre again. Creating this visibility, in full knowledge -- and indeed, hope -- that Israel would respond with force, was perhaps another motive for the Hamas attacks.
 With the future of the Abraham Accords and the normalisation of the relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia now in doubt, economic repercussions could also follow. 
 In particular, the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor involving railways, ports, and green energy installations, which is supposed to run from India through Saudi Arabia to ports in Israel, could be put on ice. 
 The perception of a possible widening of hostilities involving Iran, which prompted the US to send two aircraft carrier strike groups to regional waters, could also raise the risks of oil shipments from the Strait of Hormuz being disrupted, which may explain the sudden spike in oil prices last week to above US$90 (S$123) a barrel. 
 Questions in IsraelThe events of the last 10 days could also lead to profound changes within Israel. Amid the angst over the country's humiliation, there will be demands for an accounting of why the famously effective Israeli intelligence services as well as its defence forces were caught unawares by the Hamas attacks.
 Was it because Israeli forces were preoccupied in the West Bank dealing with the unrest among Palestinians protesting against the activities of Israeli settlers there? Did the domestic turmoil in Israel triggered by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attempts to overhaul the juidiciary, which led to massive protests, including by sections of the military, compromise Israel's defence readiness? Or was it simply a complacent belief that Hamas would never dare to take on the might of the Israeli armed forces? People will want to know.
 There may also be more questioning of the hardline stance taken by the far-right Netanyahu government against the Palestinians, including calls for Jews to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, a deliberate and unnecessary provocation. 
 The creation last week of an emergency war government that includes the centrist opposition National Unity Party led by former general Benny Gantz may shelve, if not roll back, some of the radical policies of the Netanyahu government -- including the proposed judicial overhaul -- and marginalise its most hardline elements. 
 The Palestinian issue, which the government had pushed to one side through its blockades and other restrictions and by effectively locking up Gaza, known as the world's largest open-air prison, will resurface with a vengeance. Whether Mr Netanyahu will survive as Israel's Prime Minister after the war ends is an open question -- much will depend on how the war goes.
 But regardless, there will be more political pressure from Israel's allies, including the United States as well as countries in the Middle East and Israeli society itself, that war alone will not be enough to ensure Israel's security -- because violence will only beget more of the same -- and that a political process involving the Palestinians can no longer be avoided.

S'pore Red Cross and Govt pledge $505,000 towards relief efforts

 The Singapore Government and Singapore Red Cross (SRC) have pledged a total of $505,000 in humanitarian aid to support relief efforts amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. 
 In a media statement on Monday afternoon, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said the Government will contribute $300,000 towards humanitarian relief operations through the SRC.
 Earlier on Monday, the SRC pledged US$150,000 (S$205,000) to relief efforts.
 Aid will be provided to its partners, including the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and the Magen David Adom (MDA) in Israel, both members of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the SRC in a statement on Monday. 
 The SRC has also launched a public fund-raising appeal, starting on Monday, for the relief and recovery operations. The appeal will close on Jan 31, 2024. 
 Hostilities between Israel and Hamas have significantly escalated since Oct 7, when the Gaza-based militant group lobbed rockets into Israel and breached the Gaza-Israel border fence to attack nearby towns.
 In a tit for tat, Israel declared war on Hamas, launching air strikes at Gaza. It is reportedly gearing up for a ground invasion to destroy Hamas. 
 Mr Benjamin William, secretary-general and chief executive of the SRC, said: "We strongly urge the protection of non-combatants and critical infrastructure such as medical facilities, water and power systems, so that humanitarian actors, including the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement, will be able to have access to civilians needing help."
 The crisis has displaced more than one million people in Gaza, said the SRC.
 With this number expected to rise, the need for humanitarian assistance in the region is pressing, it added. 
 Along the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, the PRCS has been transporting casualties to hospital and providing emergency medical care to the injured. It has also been providing urgent field relief, including mattresses and water, to displaced families. 
 The MDA has deployed medical teams with ambulances and intensive care units to provide essential care for the injured. It has also ramped up blood drives and conducted evacuation operations to move civilian casualties to hospital.

I was glad to read the exchange of letters between the Chief Rabbi and the Mufti of Singapore (S'pore Mufti, Chief Rabbi exchange letters, reiterate importance of unity, Oct 16).
 This is an uplifting note of love and kindness, amid the horrors we now hear about, in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. 
 I dream and wish that the international community could take steps to mitigate the humanitarian crisis happening now. I wish those Palestinians forced to go into refugee camps could find conditions even better than the homes they had to leave. Freedom from fear. Decent living conditions. Access to jobs. Education for their children, from teachers they trust.  
 I dream that Singapore could be the trusted broker, to urge heavyweights like Saudi Arabia to provide funding, and international agencies to help organise and oversee. A crisis could become a turning point in bringing love and kindness to what used to be called the Holy Land.  
 I dream a wonderful story of multi-religious delegations from Singapore approaching international bodies to make this happen and to carry Singapore's practice of inter-religious harmony to the world.

Biden backs Israel, blames militants for deadly Gaza hospital blast

Byline: , Biden backs Israel, blames militants for deadly Gaza hospital blast
Body


TEL AVIV  US President Joe Biden arrived in Israel on Wednesday pledging solidarity in its war against Hamas.
 He also backed Israel's account that a blast that killed huge numbers of Palestinians at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday had been caused by militants.
 The fireball that engulfed the Al Ahli Arab Hospital delivered some of the most harrowing images yet of the Israel-Hamas war.
 The blast also wrecked White House plans for Mr Biden's emergency diplomatic mission to the Middle East, with Arab leaders calling off their planned summit with the US President.
 Palestinian and Israeli officials have traded blame over the explosion, which reports said killed as many as 500 people. 
 Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Biden said: "I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion of the hospital in Gaza yesterday, and based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you."
 "But there's a lot of people out there not sure, so we've got a lot, we've got to overcome a lot of things," he added.
 "The world is looking. Israel has a value set like the United States does, and other democracies, and they are looking to see what we are going to do."
 In the US, the Biden administration issued sanctions aimed at disrupting Hamas' funding, targeting what it said was "a secret Hamas investment portfolio", a financial facilitator tied to Iran and a Gaza-based virtual currency exchange, among others.
 The sanctions, imposed under a terrorism-related executive order, targeted nine individuals and one entity based in Gaza and elsewhere including Sudan, Turkey, Algeria and Qatar, the US Department of Treasury said in a statement.
 Prior to the sanctions announcement, Hamas said in a statement that the US was "blindly biased to Israel".
 Mr Biden's trip to the Middle East was supposed to calm the region, even as he demonstrated US support for its ally Israel, which has vowed to annihilate the Hamas movement whose fighters killed 1,400 Israelis in a rampage on Oct 7.
 Israel's retaliatory strikes on the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by Hamas, has killed around 3,300 people.
 After the hospital blast, Jordan cancelled the second half of Mr Biden's itinerary: a planned summit in Amman with the leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority.
 Failure to meet Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas or any Palestinian official, while meeting Israelis on their soil, may undermine Mr Biden's diplomatic message and draw critics at home and abroad. The US is leaning heavily on Egypt to help with humanitarian efforts. 
 Meanwhile, Mr Netanyahu thanked Mr Biden for his "unequivocal support". 
 At a later meeting, he told the US President that Israel would try to avoid civilian casualties in its war against Hamas in Gaza, which he described as challenging due to the tactics of the militant group.
 "This will be a different kind of war because Hamas is a different kind of enemy," Mr Netanyahu said in televised remarks. "As we proceed in this war, Israel will do everything it can to keep civilians out of harm's way." 
 Mr Biden said the US would "continue to have Israel's back as you work to defend your people".
 After Mr Biden backed the Israeli account of the hospital blast, other Western leaders also called for caution.
 "Last night, too many jumped to conclusions around the tragic loss of life at Al Ahli hospital," Britain's Foreign Secretary James Cleverly posted on X. "Getting this wrong would put even more lives at risk. Wait for the facts, report them clearly and accurately. Cool heads must prevail."
 The blast unleashed new fury on streets across the Middle East, even as Mr Biden sought to calm emotions and prevent the conflict from sweeping across borders.
 Palestinian security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse anti-government protesters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, seat of Mr Abbas.
 The US State Department issued a new warning to Americans not to travel to Lebanon, where border clashes between the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and Israel over the past week have been the deadliest since the last all-out war in 2006.
 While Mr Biden has strongly backed Israel following the Oct 7 attacks, he is under intense pressure to win a clear Israeli commitment to alleviate the plight of civilians in the Gaza Strip, where 2.3 million Palestinians are under total siege, with no access to food, fuel, water or medical supplies.
 The Israeli military announced on Wednesday that humanitarian aid would be made available in a "humanitarian zone" in Al-Mawasi on the south of the Gaza Strip coast near the Egyptian border. It did not spell out how aid would get there. REUTERS

 Singapore's leaders on Wednesday wrote to their Palestinian Authority (PA) counterparts to express their condolences on the mounting civilian toll in the Gaza Strip.
 They also reiterated Singapore's position that a negotiated two-state solution is the only viable option to resolve the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
 President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, in his letter to PA President Mahmoud Abbas, said he was "deeply concerned by the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the immense loss of life and suffering dealt on innocent civilians", which "have arisen from Israeli military operations in response to the attacks by Hamas on Israel" on Oct 7.
 "On behalf of the Singapore people, I extend our deepest sympathies to the wounded and the families of the bereaved," he wrote. "Singapore urges all parties to do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians, abide by international humanitarian law, and allow for the urgent delivery of aid to the affected civilians in the Gaza Strip."
 He added: "Singapore remains convinced that the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be resolved by a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions enabling Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace and security, and with dignity. I hope that all sides will find a way to work towards this critical goal."
 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in a letter to PA PM Mohammad Shtayyeh, said he was deeply saddened by the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, as well as the loss of Palestinian civilian lives, including during the Gaza hospital blast on Tuesday.
 "On behalf of the Government of Singapore, I offer our deep condolences to the families of the bereaved. Singapore hopes that all parties involved will abide by international humanitarian law, and do their utmost to ensure the security and safety of civilians," he wrote.
 PM Lee noted that in response to the worsening situation, the Government has contributed $300,000 towards humanitarian aid.
 "A negotiated two-state solution with Palestinians and Israelis living side-by-side in peace and security is the only viable way to break the repeated cycles of violence," he said. "I hope all parties will find ways to achieve this vision, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions."
 Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan also wrote to PA Foreign Minister Riad Al Malki.

Asean unity endures despite divided opinion on Mid-East conflict: Experts

Byline: Hariz Baharudin, Asean unity endures despite divided opinion on Mid-East conflict: Experts
Body


JAKARTA  Asean unity was put into practice in the past week, when countries in South-east Asia worked hand-in-hand to explore negotiations for the release of hostages and to evacuate their citizens in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas.
 Despite divided opinion in the region, with Muslim-majority nations blaming Israel for the conflict and others upholding its right to defend itself, experts The Straits Times spoke to said that the spirit of cooperation within Asean has endured.
 Indonesia's officials are in touch with their Philippine counterparts to evacuate 10 of its citizens from the Gaza Strip, which has become the main target of the Israeli military's retaliatory air strikes after Hamas militants breached the border wall on Oct 7 and killed more than 1,400 people.
 Malaysia has also turned to the Philippines for help -- Foreign Minister Zambry Abdul Kadir last Thursday said it made arrangements with the Philippine Embassy in Tel Aviv to repatriate five of its citizens from the Palestinian Territories.
 Ms Joanne Lin from the ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute noted how Indonesia and Malaysia, both Muslim-majority countries, have no official diplomatic relationship with Israel, and thus have had to make use of regional ties to bring their people home.
 "Where cooperation is concerned, Asean has always strived to help each other and provide assistance to nationals of Asean countries, especially in crisis situations or conflicts in third countries," said Ms Lin, who is a co-coordinator of the Asean Studies Centre at the institute.
 Asean has in place guidelines on emergency assistance to aid the bloc's member countries in crisis situations, she said, adding, however, that any help is dependent on the capacities and resources available in the circumstances of each situation.
 "They all share common interests in the cessation of violence and the swift repatriation of their overseas nationals in Israel and the Gaza Strip," said Mr Andreyka Natalegawa, an associate fellow for the South-east Asia Programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.
 The geographical proximity of countries in South-east Asia to one another necessitates that they cooperate to overcome any challenges and resolve any conflicts, said Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at policy and business consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore.
 "Asean considers keeping people in conflict areas safe a collective responsibility and an embodiment of humane internationalism," he said.
 This is the case despite Asean members' varied responses to the Israel-Hamas conflict, experts noted.
 Malaysia has rejected Western pressure to condemn Hamas. While it urged all parties to cease acts of violence when the attacks began, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Monday that his government will continue to maintain relations with Hamas, which is considered a terrorist group by some countries.
 He has also criticised the international community for what he said was a one-sided stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict, and that the confiscation of land and property belonging to the Palestinian people has been "done relentlessly" by "Zionists".
 Taking a similar stance of calling for the immediate end of violence, Indonesia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement last week that the root of the conflict, namely the occupation of the Palestinian Territories by Israel, must be resolved in accordance with the parameters agreed upon by the United Nations.
 On the flipside, although the Philippines did not name Hamas directly, it issued a statement soon after the retaliation of Israeli forces, saying it "understands the right of states to self-defence in the light of external aggression as recognised in the UN Charter".
 There are also countries that have taken a more balanced stance, like Thailand and Singapore.
 After the attacks started on Oct 7, Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Jakkapong Sangmanee said Bangkok's position was "one of neutrality" and that Thailand "promotes a solution that would allow Palestine and Israel to co-exist".
 Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said on Monday that it was "deeply distressed" by the situation in the Gaza Strip, and urged both sides in the conflict to take steps towards the "ultimate goal" of a negotiated two-state solution consistent with UN Security Council resolutions.
 "Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve to live in peace, security and dignity," said MFA. 
 Using regional tiesAlthough Asean member states have different levels of diplomatic engagement with Israel and Palestine and have responded differently to the crisis, these dynamics do not necessarily stand in the way of the members leveraging intra-South-east Asia regional diplomatic ties, said Mr Andreyka.
 Thailand on Oct 9 said that it was working with Malaysia, as well as with Jordan and Egypt, to secure the release of their citizens taken hostage by Hamas. These three nations have ties with the militant group.
 Reuters reported that dozens of people have been captured, and some Thai workers were huddling in bunkers awaiting rescue.
 Given the diverse domestic sentiments, it is expected that the Asean nations will respond differently to a crisis such as the Israel-Palestine conflict, said Dr Mustafa, who is also a visiting professor in international relations at the Islamic University of Indonesia. But the differing views do not prevent them from working with one another as regional neighbours to resolve a crisis, he said.
 Indonesia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lalu Muhammad Iqbal told reporters last Friday that discussions were ongoing for Asean to issue a statement on the Israel-Hamas conflict.
 But the deep differences in ideology in the region mean that as much as Asean is united in appealing for the end of the violence, issuing such a joint statement may be challenging, experts said.
 "This will be a tough one to formulate, considering the diverse positions of Asean countries on this issue will be quite hard to bridge. A common position or outlook will be almost impossible, considering the very diverse foreign and security policies among the Asean countries, especially towards Israel and the Palestinians," said Ms Lin.
 It is likely that the bloc will issue a statement, but instead of taking sides in this conflict, it will call for de-escalation amounting to a ceasefire, the protection of civilians, the provision of humanitarian aid, and for international law to be followed, said Dr Mustafa.
 He expects that a joint statement will also likely reiterate Asean's longstanding position for a negotiated two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
 Asean statements usually do not name parties involved, and it would be "very basic" to just express concern over the situation and call on parties to exercise self-restraint, Ms Lin said.
 She also noted that certain countries within the region had in the past issued their own statements aligned to their interests. 
 "For Asean countries like Malaysia and Indonesia that have strong views on the situation, watered-down statements will clearly be insufficient for their domestic Islamic constituents, who might express disappointment with their government," she said.

Applications to hold public events and assemblies in relation to the Israel-Hamas war will be rejected, the police and the National Parks Board (NParks) said in a joint statement on Wednesday.
 The police assessed that there were public safety and security concerns associated with such events, given the heightened tensions, which NParks shared.
 In a joint statement, they said: "The police will not grant any permit for assemblies that advocate political causes of other countries or foreign entities, or may have the potential to stir emotions and lead to public order incidents."
 They added: "The peace and harmony between different races and religions in Singapore should not be taken for granted, and we must not let events happening externally affect the internal situation within Singapore.
 "Given the sensitivity of the topic and the volatility of the situation overseas, there is a real risk that such events could give rise to public disorder. As such, applications to hold such events will be turned down."
 There have been numerous incidents of violence reported in many countries amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the statement said.
 For instance, it added, an Israeli employee from the Israeli Embassy in Beijing was stabbed in front of a supermarket, while a French school teacher was fatally stabbed by a Chechen man in France last Friday.
 Also, a Palestinian-American boy, six, was allegedly stabbed to death by his landlord in suburban Chicago last Saturday, with his mother badly wounded as well.
 The ongoing Israel-Hamas war was sparked by a surprise attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct 7, drawing retaliatory strikes by Israel. More than 1,400 Israelis and at least 3,300 Palestinians have died since then. 
 The Straits Times is aware of two planned events in Singapore in relation to the Israel-Hamas war, both of which were publicised on TikTok.
 One, titled Singapore X Palestine Protest, was to be held at Marina Barrage on Wednesday at 6pm. The other, Peace Rally for Palestine, was slated to take place on Sunday at Hong Lim Park from 5pm to 8pm.
 Ms Siti Hajar Johari, the organiser of Peace Rally for Palestine, told The Straits Times: "It's sad that we are unable to hold a peaceful rally to show our support for the people of Gaza. 
 "We do not support Hamas, but we need to stand up for the innocent civilians that are caught in the crossfire."
 According to NParks' website, anyone wishing to use Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park for an event must apply for a permit. Non-Singapore citizens and non-Singapore entities must also apply for a police permit to organise or assist in the organising of an event at the venue.
 Non-Singapore citizens must also obtain a police permit to engage in public speaking at Speakers' Corner.
 Individuals are also advised to avoid making insensitive or offensive remarks about race or religion, which may threaten Singapore's racial and religious harmony. 
 Under the Penal Code, those who deliberately say words to wound the racial feelings of a person can be jailed for up to three years, fined, or both.
 Those who knowingly promote or try to promote, on the grounds of race, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill will between different racial groups can be jailed for up to three years, fined, or both.

A letter sent by Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir to Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abergel underlines the degree of goodwill that exists in Singapore among religious groups even in times of extreme external discord. Writing immediately after the terrorist attack carried out on Israel by Hamas from Gaza on Oct 7, the Mufti declared: "There is no place and no justification for any form of violence and brutality on civilians by anyone, including those by Hamas, or in any retaliatory response." Israel's response to Hamas killing and abducting its citizens was to tighten its siege of Gaza and amass troops on the frontier amid ferocious air strikes. The Mufti's condemnation of the taking of innocent Jewish lives in Israel and his equal concern for innocent Muslim (and other) lives in Gaza reveal his unequivocal recognition that "the right of civilians to live peacefully must be protected at all times".
 Reciprocating, Chief Rabbi Abergel naturally expressed the sorrow experienced by the Jewish community, but he added eloquently: "Our hearts and prayers are also with innocent Palestinian civilians who have lost their lives in this senseless conflict, and we do hope and pray for a peaceful and long-lasting solution to this war and a permanent peace between Israel and the Palestinian people, as elusive as it might seem at this moment." Here again, amid the global anguish caused by the latest Arab-Israeli conflict, the religious heads of the Muslim and Jewish communities in Singapore have found it possible to make common cause and say that the ability to coexist peacefully determines the fate of humanity. 
 These two religious leaders attest to the rare, if not unique, ability of Singaporeans to uphold a delicate and yet resilient model of religious tolerance and respect in their society. What is truly remarkable is that the Mufti and the Chief Rabbi were not being radical in their interactions with each other in dreadful times: Their views were "mainstream" in the Singapore context. That is, rational Singaporeans would understand instinctively the religious leaders' call for tolerance and peace, precisely because the alternative would be disastrous wars in a never-ending cycle of vengeance and hatred. 
 Meanwhile, the Government has made its stance clear in the reminder provided by Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam that external events must never be allowed to affect Singapore's precious peace. The Mufti and the Chief Rabbi have reiterated the norms of religious coexistence that the secular authorities are determined to uphold. The Inter-Religious Organisation, which comprises leaders and members from 10 different religious groups, has called on people to prioritise shared values in the pursuit of peace and unity. Singaporeans need to accept the counsel of the wise as they navigate their thoughts and emotions through the wildness of days.

Will Hamas in 2023 go the way of Tamil Tigers in 2009'

Body


At the turn of the century, it wasn't uncommon for Hamas and Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), better known as the Tamil Tigers, to find mention in the same debates as governments around the world weighed how to deal with these two militant groups.  
 In fact, both Hamas and the Tigers were designated by the United States as foreign terrorist organisations on the same day -- Oct 8, 1997. So, too, was Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group operating in Lebanon.
 As Israel prepares its massive response to the Oct 7 terror strikes mounted from Gaza by Hamas, it is tempting to wonder if Hamas will go the way of LTTE, the group that invented the woman suicide bomber and, in its time, was considered the world leader in suicide bombings. 
 In mid-2009, the Tigers' leadership and cadres, along with tens of thousands of civilians, were wiped out by a Sri Lankan military that had orders to finish them off root and branch. For the foreseeable future, there is little likelihood of a revival of Tamil insurgency on the island.
 I first went to Sri Lanka on June 4, 1987, and dozens more journalistic assignments to the island followed. Having spent time with combatants from both sides of the conflict over the next two decades -- including in the jungles -- I was able to report in August 2008, based on briefings by high-level sources in Colombo, that the end of the war was finally coming into view. 
 In May 2009, I was on that teardrop-shaped island when the gory, one-sided final stand of the Tigers took place around a lagoon in northern Sri Lanka. Military-released footage from the sealed-off war zone suggested the back of Tamil Tiger supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran's head had been lopped off. Prabhakaran's wife and daughter were killed in the battlefield. His 12-year-old son was also found dead, apparently shot execution-style. Some said the boy was chewing on biscuits in his last moments.
 At the same time, tens of thousands of innocents being held as human shields were killed as well in the artillery fire before the infantry came in to slaughter. 
 Same stripesI felt neither sorrow nor pity for Prabhakaran. Only disappointment. Discrimination against Tamils had indeed become entrenched on the island and he fought for them. But his manner of pursuing his goals made him a menace to the very people he claimed to protect. 
 His vicious grip on the Tigers, and determination to be the sole arbiter of Tamils' destiny led him to order the deaths of not only a series of Sinhala politicians, including then President Ranasinghe Premadasa, but also the once-and-potentially-future Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. His victims included Tamil leaders and peace activists as well, such as the founding father of the Tamil United Liberation Front Appapillai Amirthalingam, a courtly parliamentarian whom I used to tease for being more comfortable in English than his native Tamil. 
 By my calculations, if you were to discount the final months of the war, the Tigers had killed, or caused the deaths of, more Tamils than the Sinhala-Buddhist- dominated Sri Lankan state they were fighting. It seemed then that the more peace-oriented the Tamil figure, the more he was under threat from Prabhakaran. 
 Today, Hamas' uncompromising bent as it pursues its cause, and bitter contempt for the more mainstream Fatah crowd that controls the West Bank, reminds me of how the Tigers used to look down upon the moderate Tamil groups.
 Like the Tigers, Hamas has tremendous internal discipline and a relentless sense of purpose, even as it is capable of making tactical adjustments from time to time. 
 As the Tigers sometimes did with Colombo, Hamas too has had its dalliances with the Israeli state, which encouraged it at one time so as to enfeeble the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority. As events have proven in both cases, these were costly errors on the part of the state. 
 Nothing, not even the harshest security measures or inducements such as allowing Gaza residents to move beyond the Israel-erected fence to do daily jobs on the other side, breaks Hamas' resolve to confront Israel.
 Sri Lanka's Mr Premadasa similarly blundered with Tigers. 
 Shortly after taking power in 1989, the nationalist-minded president was determined to see the back of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), which many Sri Lankans perceived as an occupying army brought in by the previous government to enforce a peace accord between Colombo and Tamil groups. He opened back-channel talks with the Tigers and even supplied arms for them to take on the IPKF.  
 The Tigers played along. However, as soon as the last Indian soldier left the island in March 1990, they resumed their attacks on the Sri Lankan military. And at the 1993 May Day rally, they assassinated Mr Premadasa himself, using a suicide bomber.
 A bloody reckoningIt was only in 2004 that matters began to turn against the Tigers and, thereafter, it still took five years for the insurgency to end.
 First, a huge split erupted between Prabhakaran, whose base was in the Northern Province headquartered in Jaffna, and his top military commander "Colonel" Karuna -- whose influence base was in the Eastern Province, centred in the port town of Trincomalee. 
 Around the same time, a Congress Party-led coalition took power in New Delhi. That coalition was chaired by the Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, whose husband had been assassinated by the Tigers in 1991, apparently for sending the IPKF to Sri Lanka.
 Vengeance was inevitable. Indian intelligence, arms and vigilance at sea soon helped squeeze Tigers supply lines and their ability to freely move across the narrow Palk Strait to shelter at will in India's Tamil Nadu state. 
 A beefed-up Sri Lankan military, bolstered with arms from around the world, finished the job. By some accounts, as many as 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed in the final weeks of the war. 
 Hamas' instructions to Palestinians to ignore Israeli warnings to move south and stay put in Gaza aren't unlike what happened in 2009. The Tigers then would shoot Tamil civilians trying to escape the conflict zone, as they wanted them to remain as shields for their 1,500 fighters. The Sri Lankan army simply mowed them down, not discriminating between fighters and civilians.
 As much as the lethal arms in their possession, the ability and willingness to inflict terror through acts of sheer brutality are a potent and often-used weapon in militant hands. Hamas did that on Oct 7 with its massacre of innocents that left over 1,000 dead. Neither the very young nor the very old were spared. 
 The Tigers knew that too well; indeed, "Colonel" Karuna, who later made peace with the state, was the LTTE head of the Eastern Province in 1990 when 600 unarmed policemen who surrendered to the Tigers were shot dead. Many of the slain were barely out of their teens.
 The mass execution was calculated to inflame passion for revenge among the majority Sinhala. It suited the Tigers to sour Tamil-Sinhala relations to the maximum, since the ensuing violence would lead even moderate Tamils to look to them as necessary "saviours".
 This was why I was disappointed with Israel's Cabinet decision to "declare war" on Hamas. If anything, it is highly flattering for the militant outfit's profile to be elevated to the status of a national force, potentially equal to the feared Israeli Defence Forces (IDF). 
 At least in the short run, the Oct 7 events will pump up morale in the Arab streets and raise Hamas' cult profile across the Arab, and possibly, Muslim world. 
 Hamas strengthsFor all the similarities in the methods of the two groups, though, it would perhaps be unwise to think that their endings will also be similar.
 The looming Israel-Hamas fight is going to be fearsomely brutal. Israel's generals have little option but to unleash the bloodlust of their troops for at least a while, if only to restore the morale destroyed by Hamas through the slaughter it perpetrated and the elan with which its fighters returned with captives.
 The IDF's capabilities are fearsome, and their commanders are experienced in urban warfare. But Hamas isn't going to be run over that easily -- or "dismantled", to borrow the expression of former United States president Barack Obama. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was being realistic when he told the Knesset on Monday that while he seeks a "crushing" victory over Hamas, "victory will take time".
 What is more, while the Tigers had run out of geopolitical cover, Hamas has plenty of that left, even if Palestinians themselves may have wearied of its methods, however worthy the cause. 
 The Saudi monarchy's move to build ties with Israel will need to move even more cautiously, and keep domestic public opinion in mind. Iran has said expansion of the war is approaching the "inevitable stage".
 Hezbollah, regarded as the most powerful armed militia in the region, is fully aware that an overwhelming IDF victory in Gaza against Hamas could next set the Israelis to come after them in Lebanon. That is why it is keeping the Lebanon-Israel border "live" -- enough to warrant the IDF does not take its eyes off this flank, yet not hot enough for a full battle.
 Given how meticulously planned the Oct 7 assault was, it is just as likely that Hamas would have prepared for the inevitable blowback. A good part of its cadres would have been dispersed and melted into the civilian population. A maze of booby traps, lethal ruses and highly motivated fighters shielded by civilians await the advancing Israelis. Israel might ultimately prevail, but the cost on both sides will be huge.
 Mixed up in history, religion and geopolitics, the cause for which Hamas stands for has far wider sympathy, if not support, than the Tamil insurgency ever did. 
 Besides, what's unfolding in Gaza is under much more global scrutiny than what befell the Tigers in 2009, tucked away as they were at the southern end of the Indian subcontinent. 
 Already, next-door Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, no friend of Hamas, has said Israel's reaction has gone beyond the right to self-defence and turned into collective punishment against Palestinians.
 Global powers, including China, have echoed that sentiment and made it clear to Israel that "enough is enough".
 Hamas also has more leadership bench strength than the Tigers ever did. While it has a supreme leader in Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas also has a general council, which some refer to as a politburo. Taking him out is possible, but others are standing by to replace him.
 After the initial battlefield successes for Israel, a stalemate will likely ensue.
  That raises the question: If both the Israeli state and Hamas know that their objectives are beyond reach -- Hamas in destroying the Israeli state and Israel in neutering all Palestinian resistance -- what then is the purpose of these endless cycles of conflict'

Hamas tunnels under Gaza will be a key battlefield for Israel

Byline: , Hamas tunnels under Gaza will be a key battlefield for Israel
Body


Students of urban warfare divide the battlefield into four planes. One is the sky above cities, increasingly thick with drones. Next are the buildings that extend upwards, offering vantage points and hiding places. A third is the streetscape: the lattice of roads, alleys and paths that form a city's peacetime arteries. It is the fourth -- the tunnels lying beneath -- that will present the greatest challenge to the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) when they begin their invasion of the Gaza Strip in the coming days. 
 The first smuggling tunnels in the area were built by Bedouin clans on both sides of the Egypt-Gaza border after 1981, when Israel and Egypt demarcated the border. The first known tunnel attack from the strip occurred in 1989. But it was in 2001 that Hamas, the militant group that would later take over the territory, after Israel withdrew in 2005, began construction of a remarkable subterranean network. Its initial aim was to smuggle in material and arms from Egypt. But the tunnels had manifold other uses. 
 Commanders could hide in them and use them to communicate without relying on Gaza's phone network, tapped by Israel. They provided hiding places for weapons and ammunition. Hamas could use them for ambushes during Israeli ground wars in Gaza. And they allowed cross-border raids into Israel for attacks and abductions -- such as the kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit in 2006, a raid that later helped Hamas secure the release of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, built similar tunnels on the Israel-Lebanon border, though most were destroyed in 2018-2019.
 The military rationale of such tunnels was ultimately to erode Israel's way of war. "In 2008," said a Hamas commander, reflecting on a brief but intense war over Gaza that winter, "the air strike and air surveillance (by Israel) took us by surprise... so we made strategic plans to move the battle from the surface to underground." 
 By 2014, the group's tunnelling effort employed 900 full-time staff, with each tunnel taking three months and an average of US$100,000 to build, according to a study by the Rand Corporation, a think-tank. Hamas raised capital for the tunnels, pitching them as commercial investment schemes, complete with contracts drafted by lawyers, through mosques in Gaza. Iran and North Korea are thought to have helped with construction, supplying money and engineers.
 In 2014, the IDF launched Operation Protective Edge, an air and ground war targeting the tunnels. It destroyed around 32 of them, stretching for 100km in total, 14 of which penetrated Israeli territory. That was a tiny fraction of the whole network, which was thought to number 1,300 tunnels extending, according to Hamas, 500km in all -- more than 10 times the length of Gaza itself. A commission of inquiry after the war found that the IDF was unprepared for the danger presented by the tunnels, despite having warned the country's political leadership that they presented one of the five most serious threats to the state. Israel's defence minister at the time boasted that it would take just a few days for the IDF to destroy the tunnels it had targeted; it took weeks.
 Locating tunnels proved extremely difficult. "We were familiar with the tunnels mainly in theory," noted General Nadav Padan, who commanded a division in 2014. "We did not have operational experience." (General Padan, since retired in New York, returned to Israel on Oct 8 to rejoin the IDF.) The IDF used "geophones", as well as ground-penetrating radar, which turn ground vibrations into voltage, and detection of echoes from controlled explosions, a technique honed in the oil industry. But many tunnels were discovered thanks to human intelligence -- sources inside Gaza -- or infantry patrols that happened to find the entrances. Israeli signals-intelligence units also looked for occasions when Palestinian phone signals would suddenly disappear.
 Even when a tunnel was found, destroying it was another matter. Israel's air force attempted to drop precision bombs along the tunnel's route, a practice dubbed "kinetic drilling", but some failed to detonate at the right depth. The IDF also used "Emulsa", a gel-like explosive, but each tunnel required nine to 11 tonnes of the stuff on average, notes Rand, with ground troops forced to secure entrances for long periods. Units often had to improvise; some borrowed trolleys and agricultural equipment from Israeli border villages to shuttle explosives into Gaza.
 In the past, IDF personnel generally sought to avoid fighting in tunnels, many of which were booby-trapped. The army's high command barred troops from entering them unless one end had been blown up or secured; this order was disregarded only once, in 2014, when an Israeli officer's body was snatched into a tunnel in Rafah, Gaza's southern crossing with Egypt. The prohibition made sense. In many ways, subterranean warfare epitomises the trickiest aspects of urban warfare.
 Cities involve limited lines of sight, close-quarters battle and poor communications, with radio signals travelling poorly between tall buildings. Tunnels exacerbate all those things. Even the most sophisticated drones cannot see underground. Navigating by GPS is impossible. Radio signals for communication do not penetrate far.
 The experience of British soldiers involved in a recent tunnel exercise in Leeds, a northern city in England, highlighted the challenges that IDF soldiers are likely to face. The total darkness made night-vision goggles all but useless, for instance, since such devices rely on amplifying the faint ambient light that is present above ground even at night. Disturbing stagnant water risks releasing toxic gases into the air. The air is colder than above ground by as much as 10 deg C. "You realise that unless you are properly drilled, and have spent a long time down there, you're not moving fast," noted one British soldier in the Leeds exercise.
 The sound of weapons fire is also amplified in an enclosed space, observes the US Army's top expert on underground warfare Joe Vega. That, he says, is why larger teams are needed to clear tunnels, "because you have to continually replace people in and out -- they just can't last". The effect, known as overpressure, also causes weapons fire to kick up dust and dirt, reducing visibility.
 The techniques once used to clear tunnels -- America used tear gas in Vietnam; the Soviets a variety of chemical agents in Afghanistan -- "would likely be regarded as unlawful today", says Dr Daphne Richemond-Barak in Underground Warfare, a book on the topic. (Despite its frequent use against domestic protesters, tear gas is largely illegal in war.)
 The IDF increasingly relies on technology to help. It has remote-controlled ground robots, for instance, which can look for booby traps or ambushes lying in wait. "To enter a tunnel after a robot has combed through it... makes the situation a lot less stressful," says a soldier from the IDF's elite Samur (weasel in Hebrew) tunnelling unit, quoted in a recent study. "It lowers the tension and the environment becomes much more sterile." But tech is unreliable. "More than once a soldier was operating a robot that got stuck inside a tunnel," complained another officer. "Now try and go in and retrieve a robot that is 400m inside a tunnel complex. It's like running 150m where each metre is like crossing a desert for a month."
 In the nine years since Operation Protective Edge, the IDF has invested heavily in tunnel operations; it has introduced new doctrine, techniques and specialised units. It has constructed its own version of Hamas tunnels for training. Its Yahalom battalion, an elite combat engineering unit, which includes Samur, was reorganised, notes Dr Omer Dostri of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, a think-tank, with its size doubled from 400 to 900 personnel and new tunnel reconnaissance units attached to the IDF's Gaza division.
 It faces a forbidding task. On Monday, Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, the IDF's chief of staff, promised "to enter Gaza, to go to the places where Hamas is preparing, acting, planning, launching" and to "attack them everywhere, every commander, every operative, destroy infrastructure". In practice, identifying, clearing and collapsing several hundred kilometres of underground warrens will be the work of years -- not weeks or months. (C) 2023 THE ECONOMIST NEWSPAPER LIMITED.

Calls in Pakistan for tougher govt stance

ISLAMABAD Pakistan's government is under pressure to show greater support for Palestinians as public sympathy for Gaza grows, with the country's Islamist political parties holding large pro-Palestinian rallies in several cities following the Oct 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, which prompted Israel to retaliate.
 The Pakistani Islamist parties, which have ties to Hamas and have invited some leaders of the Palestinian militant group to speak at their rallies, have accused their own government of being soft on Israel. 
 Islamabad denies the allegations. 
 At a press conference in the Pakistani capital on Sunday, caretaker Minister for Foreign Affairs Jalil Abbas Jilani called Israel an "aggressor" and said Pakistan had not changed its position with regard to the Palestine-Israel conflict. 
 "We would continue to pursue the same policy as adopted in the past till Palestinians get their right to self-determination under the United Nations Security Council and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation resolutions," the minister said. 
 He also announced that the country will be sending humanitarian assistance to people in Gaza, where Israel has blocked supplies of food, water, fuel and electricity. 
 Pakistan, the only nuclear-armed nation in the Muslim world, does not recognise Israel and does not have a diplomatic relationship with the Jewish state. 
 In the wake of Tuesday's blast at a hospital in Gaza that killed hundreds, the Pakistani government blamed Israel, condemning the attack as "inhumane and indefensible", and calling on the international community to "take urgent measures to bring an immediate end to the Israeli bombardment and siege of Gaza and the impunity with which Israeli authorities have operated in the last few days". 
 But the government's statements have not satisfied hardline Islamist parties such as Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) and Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), whose rallies may also be opportunistic attempts to capitalise on public sympathy for Palestinians to solidify their own bases in the country, said analysts. 
 Hamas members have gone to these parties seeking aid for Gaza. 
 "We want the government to openly express solidarity with Palestine like we did in our last rally," said Mr Akram Khan Durrani, a former federal minister and a leader of JUI, which supports the Taliban government in Afghanistan and has been part of many past governments in Pakistan. 
 The party has one of the biggest networks of religious seminaries across the country, but has never been able to win more than a dozen or so seats in Pakistan's Parliament. 
 JUI's massive rally, attended by thousands last week in Peshawar, the capital of the north-western province of the country, was also addressed via video link by former Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal, who is currently based in Qatar and heads Hamas' diaspora office. 
 Mr Durrani told The Straits Times that Mr Meshaal had asked JUI leader Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman for "financial assistance for the people of Gaza". 
 Mr Fazl-ur-Rehman said his people were ready to go to Gaza if they were given access, Mr Durrani said, adding that many countries were silent because they did not want to upset the big powers expressing solidarity with Israel. 
 Ms Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's two-time former ambassador to the United States, criticised those claiming that Islamabad was soft on Israel. 
 "Pakistan has reiterated its longstanding position on the Palestinian issue," she told ST. "It has called for a resolution of the issue in line with UN resolutions and urged de-escalation and an immediate end to the fighting." 
 Dr Kamran Bokhari, a senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, said Islamabad has to tread carefully with its statements, given the dynamic situation in the Middle East. 
 "On the one hand, Islamabad has a need to align with the position of its two main financial backers, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which oppose Hamas and have ties with Israel," he said. 
 "At the same time, it has to cater to widespread domestic public sympathy for the Palestinians." 
 The UAE established diplomatic relations with Israel earlier in 2023. 
 The Saudis were also in talks with Tel Aviv, but the US-backed plans to normalise ties with Israel have been put on ice, given the deteriorating situation in Gaza. 
 The two Persian Gulf states have bailed Pakistan out of financial troubles on numerous occasions, and Islamabad is expecting another investment of US$25 billion (S$34.4 billion) each from both the UAE and Saudi Arabia. 
 Other political and religious groups have also held rallies in Pakistan in support of Palestinians. One of them, JI, has the significant ability to organise massive protests across the country and is a presence in all four provinces. 
 JI also has a close relationship with Hamas, with the militant group's political leader-in-exile Ismail Haniyeh having addressed JI rallies as recently as in 2021. 
 JI recently held a pro-Palestine rally in the port city of Karachi, where it demanded that the international community provide humanitarian aid to Gaza. 
 Al-Khidmat Foundation, the party's charity wing, has also started a donation drive. 
 Its secretary-general Syed Waqas Anjum Jaffery told ST: "We will send food, shelter, blankets and medicines to the people in Gaza like we did in the past. We have partnered humanitarian organisations in Malaysia and Turkey, and we intend to send humanitarian aid to Gaza through the Egyptian border." 
 The display of support for Hamas from these groups is to be expected, said Dr Bokhari. 
 "Hamas and Pakistani groups such as JI and JUI share the same Islamist ideology," he said. "Therefore, it is not surprising that these groups had Hamas leaders speak at their rallies." 
 The analyst believes the Pakistani religious groups are trying to exploit popular support for the Palestinian case to enhance their support base within the country. 
 "Just like Hamas is perverting the Palestinian national struggle to pursue its ideological ambitions, these Pakistani groups are also using the Israel-Hamas war as a tool to advance their own standing in Pakistani politics."

After Biden's visit, Israel's long-term war strategy is still unclear

Byline: Jonathan Eyal Global, After Biden's visit, Israel's long-term war strategy is still unclear
Body


LONDON The Israeli government is satisfied with US President Joe Biden's visit. The optics were undoubtedly good, indicating a solid measure of American support for Israel, just as the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) is about to launch its massive land offensive into Gaza.
 But the stiff hug and the awkward pat on the back with which Mr Biden greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the general silence from Israeli ministers after his departure from Tel Aviv, serve as an indication that the big questions about the purpose and final objective of Israel's war against Hamas remain largely unanswered.
 The monumental failure to anticipate the attack on Oct 7 by the Palestinian militant group, in which more than 1,400 Israelis perished, not only causes a severe dent in Israel's image as the Middle East's invincible country, but is also a disaster for Mr Netanyahu's political career.
 Mr Netanyahu -- the longest-serving prime minister in Israel's history -- has spent most of his time since he returned to office in 2022 trying to cut down the powers of his judges in a desperate attempt to avoid prosecution on corruption charges.
 Meanwhile, he thought he could fix Israel's security problems by encouraging a rivalry between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority -- the moderate and globally recognised body speaking for the Palestinians -- believing the two organisations would cancel each other out.
 These tactics contributed to the current disaster. The Prime Minister's so-called "legal reform" plan divided his nation and paralysed Israeli politics for all of 2023. And Hamas grew into Israel's deadliest foe.
 Since Israelis constantly feel under siege, they instinctively set party politics aside when they are at war; the political reckoning comes only after the battles are won.
 This time, however, the Israelis are not prepared to give their leader a respite until the current war is over. Criticism of Mr Netanyahu is widespread, and most of the local media scorns the Prime Minister's pretences to being a war leader.
 Mr Netanyahu has tried to strengthen his authority by including two key opposition leaders in the government -- former defence minister Benny Gantz and former IDF chief of staff Gadi Eisenkot.
 But although their presence in a "war Cabinet" has reassured the Israeli public and the United States, it has not clarified Israel's war strategy.
 "Smashing Hamas" is the official purpose of the IDF's operation, which seems almost certain to entail a physical occupation of Gaza City to seize the Hamas fighters' ammunition depots and blow up the intricate web of tunnels where they are hiding.
 But that would require many weeks, if not months, of occupying Gaza -- precisely the sort of operation that the IDF's chiefs of staff have always warned would suck Israel into an Afghanistan-style quagmire.
 And no operation to eliminate Hamas makes sense unless a plan accompanies it on who should rule Gaza after IDF soldiers eventually withdraw. Yet, Mr Netanyahu refuses to talk about such a plan because it would require him to discuss the future of the Palestinian Territories, a topic he has avoided throughout his political life.
 There are also big question marks about Israel's ability to fight a war on more than one front, a danger that remains only too real.
 The 2.7 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank could rebel, particularly if Israel inflicts heavy casualties on their brethren in Gaza.
 And Hezbollah -- the Iranian-funded paramilitary organisation better armed than Hamas -- lies in wait on Israel's northern borders, ready to strike with its tens of thousands of missiles.
 The current Israeli plan is to concentrate most of the IDF's ground forces against Gaza, and rely on the bulk of the air force to deter Hezbollah.
 But if violence erupts in the West Bank, the IDF would have to divert troops there at the expense of the Gaza operation.
 And if Hezbollah joins the fight, Israel may find itself in a three-cornered war that could inflict heavy casualties on Israeli civilians, should Hezbollah's vast missile arsenal overwhelm Israel's Iron Dome missile interceptors.
 Israel has successfully faced similar multi-front wars in 1948, 1967 and 1973.
 But in those wars, its opponents were states with established armies that could be decisively defeated on the battlefield. Now, Israel's enemies are all paramilitary groups which can, at best, be contained, yet never defeated.
 The Israelis know that as their tanks start rolling into Gaza, they take a far bigger gamble than just fighting Hamas.
 And paradoxically, the most dangerous moment for the Jewish state and regional stability will come a week or two into the Gaza fight when the IDF's soldiers are most engaged in ground fighting, and the country's other flanks are at peak vulnerability.

The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) said it is saddened by the latest developments of the Israel-Hamas war, including the growing death toll and the unfolding humanitarian crisis, and urged Muslims in Singapore to pray for peace.
 It said in a statement on Thursday that several mosques will hold special prayer sessions from Friday in the hope that the war will be resolved soon.
 "Muis is appalled at the humanitarian crisis occurring in Gaza, particularly the closure of the humanitarian corridor for assistance, as well as events occurring which are in violation of international law.
 "As we are currently seeing no quick end to the crisis, Muis is encouraging the Muslim community to continue offering supplication," the statement said.
 Nearly 3,800 Palestinians have been killed as at Thursday, after Israel launched a series of retaliatory offensives in response to an attack by militant group Hamas on Oct 7, which resulted in at least 1,400 Israelis dead.
 Muis added that it has been working with the Mufti's office to encourage mosques to conduct a special prayer -- recited during times of crisis -- on top of additional prayers during Friday prayers and sermons. 
 These prayers can be performed at home as well, whether individually or with family, said the Islamic body, with Muslims strongly encouraged to do so.
 Religious guidance is also available for Muslims affected by the violence in Gaza. Muis said this is being done in collaboration with online portal Muslim.sg
 Singapore's Mufti, Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, has also met religious officers in various mosques to provide them with guidance. 
 He has also engaged Muslim youth to lead them in prayer and provide them with advice on how to cope with their emotions amid the ongoing conflict.
 Muis said Muslims can also make donations to ongoing humanitarian efforts, pointing to the online fund-raising appeal being carried out by local charity Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation (RLAF).
 The donation drive will run until Oct 31, and is meant to support the urgent needs of affected communities in Gaza. As at 6pm on Thursday, RLAF has collected a total of $571,099, with $200,000 donated by Sheng Siong Group.
 The charity is working with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, with donations being accepted through multiple platforms.
 Those who wish to donate through PayNow can key in RLAF's UEN 200910530ZRLA and indicate "GAZA2023" in the remarks.
 Bank transfers can be made to RLAF at OCBC Bank current account number 601313315001.
 Cheques should be mailed to RLAF at Yusof Ishak Mosque, 10 Woodlands Drive 17, Singapore 737740; or to Muis at 273 Braddell Road, Singapore 579702. Donors who do so will have to write their name and contact number on the back of the cheque, and indicate "GAZA2023".
 A special appeal will also be made at every mosque in Singapore on Friday, with donation boxes set up, and Giving.sg also has an ongoing campaign.
 "Muis once again reiterates the need for the community to respond in a calm and constructive manner in dealing with the current conflict in Palestine, guided by compassion and rahmah following the way of the Prophet," it said, using the Arabic word for "mercy".
 Muslim voluntary welfare organisation Perdaus also expressed similar concerns over the loss of lives in and around the Gaza Strip, given that the humanitarian situation is expected to worsen.
 Urging Singaporeans to donate to humanitarian organisations, it also advised people to learn more about the conflict's history and how it has evolved to its present stage, as well as recommending that awareness of it be spread.

Parliament to have full discussion of Israeli-Palestinian conflict in early Nov

RIYADH Parliament will have a full discussion of Singapore's position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict when it next sits at the beginning of November, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday. 
 A lot of questions have been filed in Parliament, he told Singapore reporters in an interview wrapping up his visit to Saudi Arabia, adding that Singaporeans were following developments very closely and MPs would express concerns of their constituents.
 The ongoing Israel-Hamas war and growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza were a key concern raised by leaders of Asean and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, including PM Lee, at their first-ever summit earlier on Friday.
 Israel was poised to launch a ground offensive to root out the militant Hamas following its Oct 7 attack in the south of the country that killed at least 1,400 people.
 In response, Israel has bombarded Gaza and killed at least 4,100 people while imposing a near-total blockade of the densely populated enclave with a population of 2.3 million.
 "It's always very worrying when you see a humanitarian crisis developing, when innocent civilians suffer... sometimes as a side effect of military conflict, sometimes directly targeted," said PM Lee.
 "In this case, what happened on Oct 7 when Hamas attacked Israel and launched vicious horrible attacks against large numbers of civilians... is horrendous, it isn't something which could be justified by any rationale whatsoever."
 He added: "Whatever the background, whatever the historical situation, nothing justifies such an action, either in law, or indeed in human decency and morality. So that was what we have to be quite unequivocal about, and we came out immediately to condemn it."
 PM Lee also said that under international law, the Israelis have the right to defend themselves, adding that it was "humanly impossible" not to want to do so "having suffered such a grievous and terrifying attack".
 But in exercising that right, Israel has to comply with the law of war and international humanitarian law, to do all it can to minimise civilian casualties and address humanitarian concerns that are going to arise, he added.
 "You have to do this not just because the law is written that way, but also because from Israel's own interests, if you just respond emotionally, cathartically, but in a way which doesn't help to solve the problem, you may get yourself into a much worse situation than you're in," he said.
 PM Lee added that this was something many countries are concerned about, and have spoken out about, including the Americans, the British and the Europeans.
 He also made reference to a recent letter published in the Financial Times, in which a group of distinguished Jewish international jurists and professors of international law counselled Israel's leaders to act in a restrained manner that will not worsen the problem or diminish humanity.
 "It's very significant that these are people who wish Israel well, who are expressing such concerns and such views. We wish Israel well, we also wish the Palestinians well," he said.
 Turning to Singapore, PM Lee noted that people are following ongoing events very closely.
 In particular, Muslims are very agitated by developments as there is a certain feeling of empathy and compassion, closely felt, for the Palestinian cause. "It's completely understandable," he said. 
 "At the same time, we also have to do what is the sensible thing for Singapore, to maintain relations with both the Israelis as well as the Palestinians, and to do what we can to provide humanitarian support for the civilian victims in Gaza especially, but also in Israel." 
 Singapore's long-term position is clear -- a two-state solution is the only way for both sides to live in peace.
 This means Palestinians have to acknowledge that Israelis have a right to exist and to have a nation state and country, while Israelis have to acknowledge that the Palestinians have a right to exist and to live in their own country, said PM Lee.
 He added that both parties have to work towards such an outcome and cannot afford to give up on this aspiration. 
 "It looks very far off. It has not made a lot of progress in the last 10, 15 years," he said.
 "But unless you can make progress in that direction, you are doomed to generations of bloodshed and tragedy, and I don't think either side really wants that."
 PM Lee was also asked about the impact of the ongoing crisis on Asean.
 He noted that the different South-east Asian countries do not all have identical positions on the issue. 
 Singapore has diplomatic relations with Israel, like some members, as well as a good relationship with the Palestinian Authority. 
 Others have championed the Palestinian cause and do not have diplomatic relations with Israel. 
 This means the nuances and the way different countries express their views will not be the same. 
 But PM Lee noted that there was some degree of consensus on the crisis, as expressed in the Asean statement, adding that it was helpful to have such a stance. 
 Asean foreign ministers on Friday issued a joint statement condemning all acts of violence and urging the unconditional release of civilian hostages as well as safe humanitarian passage.
 Said PM Lee: "We have to understand we have different perspectives and, well, we get along and respect one another's perspectives and also respect one another."

Asean and GCC condemn attacks on civilians, call for Mid-East ceasefire

RIYADH Leaders of Asean and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have condemned all attacks against civilians and called for a durable ceasefire as the Israel-Hamas war escalates. 
 They also called for the immediate and unconditional release of civilian hostages and detainees, especially women, children, the sick and the elderly, in a joint statement following the inaugural Asean-GCC Summit in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Friday. 
 Expressing their grave concerns over recent developments in the Middle East, the leaders called "for all concerned parties to ensure the most effective and efficient access for humanitarian aid, and relief supplies and other basic necessities and essential services".
 They also urged the restoration of electricity and water, and called for allowing the unhindered delivery of fuel, food, and medicine throughout Gaza.
 The joint call from the two regional groupings comes in the wake of a growing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.
 Israel has signalled it is preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza to annihilate Hamas over the Oct 7 rampage by Hamas gunmen who killed 1,400 people in southern Israel, including citizens of Thailand and the Philippines who were working there.
 The Israeli military response has killed more than 4,100 Palestinians in Gaza, and the enclave that is home to 2.3 million people is under a tight blockade.
 The Asean-GCC statement said: "We call on all parties to the conflict to protect civilians, refrain from targeting them and to abide by international humanitarian law, particularly the principles and provisions of the Geneva Convention."
 The leaders of both blocs urged all parties involved to work towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict, with a view to realising the two-state solution.
 Such a solution would allow both Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side in peace and security, based on pre-1967 borders in accordance with international law and the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
 The leaders also said they support the initiatives of Saudi Arabia, the European Union and the Arab League to revive the Middle East peace process in cooperation with Egypt and Jordan, as well as to resolve the dispute between Israel and its neighbours.
 Opening the summit, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reiterated the kingdom's support for efforts to reach a just solution to the Palestinian cause.
 He said he was saddened by the escalating violence in Gaza, and firmly rejected the targeting of civilians.
 Addressing fellow leaders, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the latest outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has raised deep concerns, given the tragic loss of civilian lives on both sides, including at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital most recently.
 He reiterated Singapore's position, condemning Hamas' Oct 7 attack on Israel and noting that Israel has the right to defend itself. 
 However, in exercising this right, it must comply with international laws, including the laws of war and international humanitarian law, and do its utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians, he said.
 "We urge all parties to allow for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to the affected civilian population in Gaza," he added.
 PM Lee also reiterated Singapore's consistent support for a negotiated two-state solution as the only viable option to achieve a durable, just and comprehensive solution. 
 Turning to Asean cooperation with the GCC, which includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, PM Lee touched on the potential for cooperation in trade and investment, as well as decarbonisation.
 Asean can tap the GCC's expertise and investments to support Asean's vision for a regional power grid, he said. 
 "In our bilateral cooperation with the GCC, Asean has always promoted an open and inclusive regional architecture, where our external partners can engage constructively and have stakes in our continued stability and prosperity," he said.
 "This summit is thus a timely opportunity to elevate our cooperation with an important, like-minded partner." 
 Earlier on Friday, Asean foreign ministers jointly called for an immediate end to acts of violence in the conflict, and stressed the need to avoid further human casualties.
 "We strongly condemn the acts of violence which have led to the deaths and injury of civilians, including Asean nationals," they said in a statement.
 Besides reaffirming Asean's support for a negotiated two-state solution, the ministers stressed their commitment to providing emergency assistance to Asean nationals and urged the international community to support the Middle East peace process "to ensure long-lasting peace and stability in the region".

Moody's puts Israel's credit ratings on review for downgrade

WASHINGTON  United States ratings agency Moody's has put the Israeli government's A1 credit ratings on review for downgrade, citing the "unexpected and violent conflict between Israel and Hamas". 
 The crisis, sparked by the deadly attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel on Oct 7, increases the likelihood of "longer-lasting and material credit impact", Moody's said in a statement on Thursday.
 More than 1,400 people were killed in the attack, mostly civilians who were shot, mutilated or burned to death on the first day of the raid, according to Israeli officials.
 Israel responded to the attacks by unleashing a barrage of air strikes on the Gaza Strip, killing at least 3,785 Palestinians so far, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
 Moody's announced that it was putting a number of the Israeli government's credit ratings on review for a downgrade, including its long-term foreign and local currency ratings, because of the war.
 "Israel's credit profile has proven resilient to terrorist attacks and military conflict in the past," it said.
 "However, the severity of the current military conflict raises the possibility of longer-lasting and material credit impact," it added.
 Moody's statement comes after Fitch Ratings announced on Tuesday that it was placing Israel's A+ foreign and local currency issuer default ratings on "Ratings Watch Negative".
 In its announcement, Fitch cited "the heightened risk of a widening of Israel's current conflict to include large-scale military confrontations with multiple actors, over a sustained period of time". AFP

Falsehoods fire up online battle to control narratives of conflict

 A murky war of disinformation is being waged online by both Israeli and Palestinian supporters attempting to control the narrative in the wake of a deadly blast at a Gaza City hospital on Tuesday that killed hundreds  and sparked protests in the Middle East.
 In viral posts since debunked, a Facebook account masquerading as the Israeli military's Arabic-language page claimed responsibility for the blast.
 Separately, a user on X, formerly known as Twitter, falsely claimed to be an Al Jazeera journalist who had a video of a Hamas rocket landing in the hospital.
 These are just two instances of the proliferating online misinformation as Israeli and Palestinian officials blame each other for the blast and, more broadly, the war.
 As the ground battle between Israel and Hamas rages on, social media platforms such as X, Telegram, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok are rife with content attempting to shape narratives of the war. 
 Experts say that some of this is misinformation, or content that is simply inaccurate, while some is disinformation, defined as content that is intended to mislead. 
 Spreading alongside real stories of human suffering are shocking but unverified accounts that have sometimes entered mainstream political discourse before they are deemed factual.
 For instance, claims that Hamas had beheaded babies and toddlers, which have not been independently verified, were referenced in remarks by United States President Joe Biden on Oct 11. 
 A US official later clarified that neither the President nor the administration had seen evidence of this. 
 People seeking a closer look at the war have found themselves duped into viewing old content masquerading as fresh footage. 
 This is used in part to "create a sense of outrage", said Dr Jean-Loup Samaan of the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute.
 For example, a widely shared image on X purportedly depicting the Israeli murder of Palestinian children was actually taken in Syria in 2013, said BBC journalist Shayan Sardarizadeh, who covers disinformation. 
 Speculation that undermines established narratives has also surfaced. 
 A conspiracy theory alleging that Hamas had help from inside Israel in planning the Oct 7 attack has spread across social media, according to a study by the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab published on Oct 12. 
 "The danger of mis/disinformation and propaganda further inflaming an already boiling conflict remains as high as ever," the study said.
 The emergence of false and misleading content on the Israel-Hamas war is to be expected, said experts.
 "Like any conflict... there is always an element of misinformation or disinformation on both sides to make their narrative the most compelling," Dr Samaan told The Straits Times. 
 While it is not easy to discern what lies behind this cacophony of voices online, Dr Samaan said that governments and non-state actors have an interest in supporting information campaigns backing their respective agendas.
 Associate Professor Marc Owen Jones of the Hamad bin Khalifa University in Qatar said individuals also have a role to play.
 "The polarisation of the conflict means that people on both sides are less willing to accept that 'their side' may be capable of brutality, so people may share false narratives simply because they agree with them," the disinformation expert told ST.
 The misinformation and disinformation surrounding the Israel-Hamas war, while not necessarily of a larger scale than past conflicts, are "particularly virulent", said Prof Jones. 
 One contributing factor is that social media platforms have "backed away from user safety and content moderation, meaning that there is less censorship of fake news and hate speech", he said.
 Another factor is that individuals can also "propagate misinformed views faster and to a broader audience" by paying to become "verified" premium users on X or to use the "promote" function on TikTok, noted Assistant Professor Saifuddin Ahmed from Nanyang Technological University's Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information.
 According to US-based media analysis firm NewsGuard, nearly three-quarters of the most viral posts on X advancing misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war in the first week of the conflict were pushed by "verified" X accounts. 
 Users of X can pay US$8 (S$11) a month, or US$84 a year, to receive a blue-tick verification on their profiles and have their posts prioritised by X's algorithm.
 The spate of online misinformation and disinformation surrounding the Israel-Hamas war is unlikely to have reached its peak.
 "The battle of narratives will probably get tougher and more intense after the Israelis start their ground invasion," said Dr Samaan.
 "The most dangerous narrative," he said, is one that argues "that this is not just a conflict between Israel and Hamas, but a conflict between a Jewish entity and Muslims".
 Malicious actors on social media and also some international media organisations are guilty of framing the sensitive underlying issues as a religious conflict, said Prof Saifuddin, noting that such narratives are "a concern for any multicultural society, including Singapore". 
 "(We) must not take social media information at face value but seek out information from reliable and multiple sources. 
 "It is crucial to recognise that most misinformation and disinformation operate by exploiting our emotions rather than appealing to our rational thinking," he said.
