UN suspends services at Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon after clashes

August 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A United Nations agency has suspended services at the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon to protest against the presence of armed fighters around its four schools and other facilities within the area.
Deadly clashes   at the Ein el-Hilweh camp last month after a gunman from the hardline Junud al-Sham armed group tried to assassinate Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the Palestinian political faction, Fatah, forcing hundreds to flee.
Khalil's companion, Fatah commander Abu Ashraf al-Armouchi was fatally shot and several of his aides were killed.Al-Armouchi was in charge of security inside Ein el-Hilweh.
The camp is home to more than 63,000 Palestinian refugees and their descendants, who were forcibly displaced from their homes in 1948 in the run-up to Israel's creation.
"The agency does not tolerate actions that breach the inviolability and neutrality of its installations," United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said in a statement.
It said that schools in the camp were unlikely to be available for 3,200 children at the start of the new school year.
"UNRWA reiterates its call on armed actors to immediately vacate its facilities, to ensure unimpeded delivery of much-needed assistance to Palestine refugees," the agency added.
More than a dozen people were killed in the fighting, and thousands of others were displaced.
Following a 1969 agreement between Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the Lebanese army largely avoids entering the camps, but Lebanon's caretaker prime minister had earlier this month threatened to   to Ein el-Hilweh if the clashes continued.
Dorothee Klaus, the director of UNRWA Affairs in Lebanon, said UNRWA facilities have been damaged by the recent fighting in the camp.
'All UNRWA facilities, including schools, must be protected at all times," she said in a statement. "Schools are meant to be a sanctuary for children and zones of peace where children learn and play. They must never be used for armed conflict, clashes, violence and fighting."
Some 400,000 refugees live in Lebanon's 12 Palestinian camps.
Established in 1949 following the first Arab-Israeli War, UNRWA provides public services including schools, primary healthcare and humanitarian aid in the Israeli-occupied territories of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, as well as the neighbouring countries of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

Israeli army and settler attacks against Palestinians in West Bank increase

October 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
As Israel continues to pummel the Gaza Strip from the sky, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are gripped with tension and have reported an increase of attacks against them by settlers and soldiers alike.
Since last Saturday, at least 55 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,100 others wounded.
According to human rights activist Samir Abu Shams, the Israeli army is in violation of multiple international laws, particularly the Geneva Conventions, which stress that civilians should be unharmed in situations of war and armed conflict.
"What we are seeing today is that the occupation forces enter civilian areas, create friction, and target civilians with gunfire without any justification," the 60-year-old from Tulkarem said. "Most of the cases of Israeli gunfire have been against Palestinian civilians passing through the street or going to their place of work."
On the one hand, Abu Shams went on to say, the Israeli occupation isolates the Gaza Strip from the West Bank.
"On the other, it takes revenge on civilians in the occupied West Bank and takes measures to arm settlers and gives instructions to open fire on men, women, and children," he said.
Israeli army shooting at Palestinian civilian cars
On Friday, Karem al-Jallad was driving home from Tulkarem's vegetable market to his home in the southern district of the city at about 8:20pm (17:30 GMT). He was on the street near the Jewish settlement of Gishuri, which connects the west of Tulkarem to its south.
Israeli soldiers fired at his car and al-Jallad, thinking it was sound bombs, kept driving. But he was hit three times by live ammunition: in the chest, hand, and shoulder.
"There were five bullets on the front of Karem's car," his cousin Alaa al-Jallad said to Al Jazeera.
"Karem kept driving on the road until he reached the al-Safir roundabout, and from there he was transferred by ambulance to the local hospital," he said.
Karem's brother Ammar said he is undergoing a second operation.
"Yesterday evening, the doctors took out the bullet that hit him in the shoulder and settled in the neck," Ammar said. "The second bullet caused a fracture and tear in the tendons, according to the doctors."
Ahmed Zahran of the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Tulkarem told Al Jazeera that Israeli soldiers shot at four civilian cars in the same area on Friday, killing one Palestinian and injuring seven others. A second Palestinian, 16, was shot on Friday and died the next day from his injuries.
"We headed there in our ambulance and saw a white Hyundai car that was shot at," Zahran said. "The four passengers were all injured, all in serious condition."
His team transferred three of the wounded, and when they went back for the fourth Palestinian, the Israeli army targeted the medics and ambulance.
"We continued our work quickly, and at the same time we received a report of gunfire at another car about 30 metres (98 feet) away from us," Zahran said. "After identifying it, we found no casualties, only an empty car in the middle of the street, with no one in it."
They found Karem on the roundabout, and after transferring him to the hospital, they received another call that two other Palestinians were shot and injured while driving in their car as they passed by the settlement.
Settler attack
On Thursday evening, Randa Ajaj was in the car with her son Ismail and husband, who was driving back to Ramallah from the village of Yabrud.
"At one of the checkpoints, a Jewish settler opened fire in the air," Ismail, 19, said. "We thought it was the soldiers so my father slowed down, but when we saw it was settlers with flashlights and guns, who tried to attack our car, my dad sped away."
The settlers opened fire. The first bullet hit Ismail in the foot then landed in his mother's body, where her kidney is.
Randa, a mother of seven, had a few years earlier donated one of her kidneys to her brother.
A second bullet penetrated Ismail's shoulder, after shattering the back window.
Thinking Randa was just injured, the father continued driving and made it to a medical centre in the village of Silwad. From there, an ambulance took them to Ramallah Hospital.
"We thought she had fainted from fear because there were no traces of blood, but it turned out to be an explosive bullet that had penetrated my foot and landed in my mother," Ismail said, his voice breaking. "We didn't know that she had been killed."
Ismail couldn't continue the interview. He keeps watching videos of his mother's funeral on his phone since he couldn't attend, as he was in the hospital.
"She was loved by everyone," her brother Abdullah said.
Danger on the roads for Palestinian drivers
Taxi drivers working on the Nablus-Ramallah line have also lessened their movements, citing checkpoint closures and an increase in settler attacks.
"There were 112 cars on the Nablus-Ramallah line before the war, and now there are only 25 cars driven by those from villages," Nael Dweikat, a 51-year-old driver, said.
"Most of the entrances to the Palestinian villages on this route are closed with dirt barriers, as people generally do not go out in their cars because of the increased danger unless it's absolutely necessary."
Dweikat said that drivers have to take an alternative route to leave Nablus instead of the main road, which is 45 minutes longer.
"On Thursday, I was exposed to great danger during the funeral of the four Palestinians killed in the village of Qasra," he said. "By chance, I was at the al-Sawiya village junction at the same time as the funeral procession."
The settlers closed the road and attacked the procession, killing Ibrahim Al-Wadi and his son Ahmed. The road was completely closed for two hours.
"I feel afraid and my nerves are high while travelling because the roads are not safe and the settlers block and attack Palestinian cars with stones at many intersections within the West Bank," Dweikat said. "Sometimes it takes some drivers five hours to get from one governorate to another."
For Abu Shams, the human rights activist, this is all part of a calculated Israeli plan to pressure and cause a displacement of the Palestinian population whether in the occupied West Bank or the Gaza Strip.
"It is not a hidden agenda," he said. "The Israel far-right ministers have announced more than once that they want a land without Palestinian residents, and they promised their voters, as part of their electoral campaigns, to implement that."
"In short, they want to implement a third Nakba by spreading chaos and disrupting Palestinian institutions in more than one place, especially those that provide services to society."

Israel-Hamas war: List of key events, day 42

November 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Nearly six weeks after the start of the war, here is the situation on   November 17, 2023:
Latest on human impact and fighting
The Syrian army announced early on Friday that the Syrian air defence shot down Israeli missiles in the surroundings of the capital, Damascus. While most of the missiles were intercepted, some caused material damage, the army said.
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that Gaza faces the possibility of immediate starvation, adding that only 10 percent of the necessary food supplies are entering the besieged enclave. Air attacks have hit bakeries and wheat mills in southern Gaza, leaving only one company able to produce flour in the enclave.
A communications blackout in much of Gaza, as well as the attacks on Gaza's health system, are making it difficult for the Ministry of Health to   about locations hit by Israeli strikes.
The Israeli military said on Friday it retrieved the body of a soldier, Noa Marciano, who had been held captive by Hamas. The body of another Hamas captive,   was also found, the Israeli military said on Thursday.
Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp was hit by Israeli air strikes on Thursday, killing at least 11 people, according to Palestinian authorities.
Situation at Gaza's hospitals
The situation in Gaza's hospitals continues to worsen.
The Israeli army continues to remain at Gaza's largest medical facility, the al-Shifa Hospital, for a third day in a row. The radiology department of the hospital has been damaged and several bodies have been removed from the medical facility.
The Israeli military said on Thursday night that it found an operational tunnel shaft under al-Shifa Hospital. The military had insisted that Hamas was operating its command centre from under the hospital but has so far   to back its claims.
Hospitals in Gaza have run out of beds to accommodate patients, forcing many to be treated on hospital floors. They are also resorting to manually performing procedures as they have run out of medical supplies and equipment.
Malaysia's former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said  on Friday that a medical facility in Gaza established by his foundation has been destroyed by Israeli bombing.
Diplomacy
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced  on X on Friday that he discussed the current situation with his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese. Trudeau has been pressured by the Canadian electorate to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Meanwhile, Albanese's government has resisted calling for a ceasefire.
The US State Department released a statement on Thursday following the attack on a Jordanian military hospital in Gaza on Wednesday that wounded seven people. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller expressed concern for the wounded, commending the Jordanian government for the establishment of the hospital. Miller, however, did not condemn the strike nor did he say who was responsible.
The State Department also said on Thursday that US Secretary of State   spoke with Israeli war cabinet Minister Benny Gantz, discussing the urgent need to de-escalate tensions in the West Bank, including by confronting rising levels of settler violence.
Blinken also spoke to Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry about efforts to increase humanitarian aid in Gaza, reaffirming Washington's rejection of the forced displacement of Palestinians. However, calls for a ceasefire in Gaza remain off the table.
The Elders, a group of former global leaders working towards peace, sent an open letter to President Joe Bidensaying that Israel's destruction of Gaza and killing of civilians put 'US credibility and interests across the world' at stake.
Updates in the West Bank
Three Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli drone strike in Jenin in the occupied West Bank, the head of the Palestinian ambulance service told Reuters on Friday.
Israeli forces arrested two paramedics and ordered the Ibn Sina Hospital in Jenin evacuated while launching a raid on the hospital. Ibn Sina is one of the Palestinian territory's largest medical facilities and is considered a specialised hospital. Armoured vehicles damaged cars and roads in the raid.
Israeli police killed three Palestinians in open fire at a checkpoint in Bethlehem.

'Very risky': Israel faces months-long campaign against Hamas Gaza tunnels

November 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
As Israeli forces advance forward in northern Gaza, they are also aiming deeper. Their target, a labyrinth of tunnels that the Palestinian armed group Hamas has meticulously crafted throughout the years to build up the core system of its operations.
But while the Israeli military met few obstacles in   for more than a month, experts suggest that eliminating the underground spiderweb of tunnels could present its army with far greater challenges.
'It would be a slow, grinding, months-long task to reduce them entirely, and probably the digging will go on as the [Israeli army] tries,' said Richard Outzen, non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Turkey and senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, a defence policy think tank.
While few know the full extent of what some Israeli officials call the 'metro', the tunnels are believed to cross the entire enclave for hundreds of kilometres, with experts estimating a depth between a range of 15 to 60 metres (50 to 200 feet). In 2021, the Israeli army said that there were 300km (186 miles) of tunnels running under the strip.
Some of these are serviced with oxygen tanks, water pipes and electricity lights. An exclusive video from Al Jazeera Arabic from 2021 shows concrete-reinforced corridors leading to an underground office with a functioning phone line and rooms storing weapons.
The system is believed to have a periphery, with shallower tunnels easier to destroy from the surface, and a core which is where the commando centres, weapons storages, missiles and, more recently, some of the about 240 Israeli captives taken by Hamas, are believed to be. Tunnels allow fighters to conduct surprise attacks and to move quickly across the strip without Israeli eyes being able to trace them.
'One of the main efforts of Hamas for the past 17 years was digging tunnels that would make them resilient, this was not a side activity,' said Andreas Krieg, associate professor at the defence studies department at King's College London. And what works above ground, does not underneath. 'Israel has the technology advantage for everything, but they have been lured into a low-technology war where that competitive advantage is undone the moment they have to go underground,' he added.

The existing system today is the result of more than two decades of work, starting from the 1980s when tunnels were passages used to smuggle goods from Egypt, said Joel Roskin, a geomorphologist at the Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel, who has long been studying tunnels in Gaza.
Farmers from the area used to dig wells to reach underground water for their fields – a know-how that was then applied to excavate deeper for tunnels. The coastal strip's soil was easy to carve. 'It's not stone, but sediment made of sand and clay – it goes down metres so it's easy to dig,' Roskin said.
Back then, tunnels were mostly private endeavours to smuggle goods. The first sign that they were being used also by armed groups was in 2001 when an Israeli military post was blown up with an explosive coming from below ground. But it was five years later that the mysterious tunnels breached Israeli public consciousness when Palestinian fighters emerged from a shaft and kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.
After Hamas gained full control of the strip in 2007, winning elections and kicking out rival party Fatah following violent battles,  . Tunnels turned into the only way to break the siege and get food, goods, weapons, and reportedly, even lions, into Gaza. Their numbers proliferated.
'Hamas started to build up a city below the city knowing that if they would start an armed resistance they would have been able to retaliate and they would have been able to do this underground,' said Krieg.

Since October 7, when   and killed 1,200 people, the Israeli army has retaliated by bombing Gaza. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israeli air strikes have killed   – more than a third of them children. Central to the Israeli military's argument for targeting civilian and medical infrastructures, where thousands of people are sheltering, is the presence of underground tunnels where it claims Hamas fighters operate. The armed group and medics deny these allegations.
Whether Palestinian fighters have dug tunnels underneath civilian infrastructure or not, human rights groups have accused Israel of not taking adequate precautions to avoid civilian deaths, and of breaching international law.
On the military front, air strikes can't reach deep enough to destroy the core of the tunnels, say experts. For those, the Israeli army will have to gain control of all exits and entries – an extremely lengthy and dangerous operation. Even if an area has been meticulously cleared, a tunnel shaft could be hidden behind enemy lines, allowing Palestinian fighters to attack Israeli soldiers from the rear.
'It's a process that requires a lot of time and it's very risky,' said Krieg. Other options used in the past have included pouring wet cement or sewage, as   along its border, inside tunnels. But these techniques wouldn't work if the tunnels have multiple entries and exits.

Entering tunnels presents challenges too, and Israel will try to avoid doing so unless strictly necessary, according to analysts. Oxygen is scarce, if not absent. Visibility is limited. And soldiers are vulnerable to ambushes and booby-traps.
Outzen, who is also a former colonel in the United States Army, believes the army will likely use a combined approach.
'Raids into certain tunnels seen as high-value because of hostages or militant leadership, brute force bombing where the tunnels are close to the surface, and demolition operations involving insertion of engineering teams with demolition experts [explosive and mechanical] to collapse central tunnels where possible,' he said.
But such operations demand time which is a resource some believe Israel is fast exhausting. Pressure is mounting on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to agree to a ceasefire as images of the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza are drawing global condemnation.
Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the US and former deputy minister, said during a conference this week that Israel has a time bomb 'ticking rapidly'.
'If the army thinks it has an unending carte blanche to end this operation, I would say no.'

Rafah, Gaza Strip – A convoy of ambulances lined up on the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing.
Inside one of them was volunteer paramedic Khader Shamout, but he wasn't there to transport the wounded. Shamout had been transporting people injured in an Israeli air attack on October 20 when his ambulance was hit.
His arm was badly wounded. Initially, the doctors amputated it below the elbow but repeated infections meant he had to undergo seven surgeries and further amputations. His arm is now amputated above the elbow and he requires further surgery.
"The pain is excruciating," he explained. "I ask Egypt to treat me well so I can go back to Gaza and live a better life. I hope I'll have one last operation. All I want is to be around my young family, my two-year-old son and baby daughter, safe and sound."

For the first time since October 7, when Israel began its offensive on the Gaza Strip following an attack by Hamas that left more than 1,400 people dead in Israel, foreign nationals, some Palestinians with dual citizenship and dozens of injured people have been permitted to leave the Gaza Strip. According to the General Authority for Crossings in Gaza, 76 wounded Palestinians have crossed into Egypt so far.
According to Gaza's health ministry, 8,796 Palestinians have been killed in more than three weeks of Israeli air raids, including 3,648 children, and 22,000 people have been wounded. Hospitals, overwhelmed by the sheer number of casualties and   as a result of   of the strip, are in a state of collapse. At least 16 of the territory's 35 hospitals have been  , as have 51 of its 72 primary healthcare clinics.
في اليوم 25 من بدء العدوان على الشعب الفلسطيني في غزة، قررت #مصر  فتح معبر رفح من أجل استقبال 81 جريحا فلسطينيا من أصل أكثر من 22000 جريح فلسطيني، أي ما نسبته أقل من 0.34٪
شكرا مصر

Translation: On the 25th day of the start of the aggression against the Palestinian people in Gaza, Egypt decided to open the Rafah crossing in order to receive 81 wounded Palestinians out of more than 22,000 wounded Palestinians, i.e. a percentage of less than 0.34%. Thank you Egypt.
Major General Mohamed Shusha, the governor of Egypt's North Sinai, said that hospitals in his region had 300 available beds for patients from the Gaza Strip and that a medical team on the Egyptian side of the border would evaluate the patients before transferring them to hospitals.
Egypt has also prepared a field hospital with 50 beds in Sheikh Zuweid, 15km (nine miles) from Rafah, and plans to send some of the most serious cases to hospitals elsewhere in the Sinai region or further afield to the city of Ismailia.
'There are thousands more'
Hisham Adwan, the spokesman for the General Authority for Crossings, explained that Egypt had informed them on Tuesday night that the border, the only crossing point out of the Gaza Strip, would be opened. But the small number permitted to cross is only a fraction of those who need treatment.
"There are thousands of serious cases suffering from burn or trauma wounds, and they also need medical treatment abroad," he said.

"We need fuel to operate hospitals and for ambulances and other vehicles used by the civil defence teams to rescue people under the rubble," he explained. "We want the border crossing to be open on a consistent daily basis in order to transfer the seriously wounded so they can get the best treatment."
Naseem Hasan, an ambulance officer who was at the Rafah crossing, explained that the wounded had been transferred from four different hospitals:   in Gaza City, the European Hospital and the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, and the   in Deir el-Balah.
"These wounded need advanced treatment and operations," he said. "There are thousands more left that need medical referrals. There are no beds available in ICUs in the hospitals in Gaza."
Among the injured were many who had serious burns and needed immediate intensive care, he said, adding, "These are injuries that we have never seen before."

Hoping for a better future
Saeed Imran, 23, was on his way to his job as a labourer on October 10 when an Israeli air attack struck a building close to him in Khan Younis.
He woke up in the hospital, with shrapnel in his head and his right eye.
"I can only see out of my left eye now," he said. "I did an operation on my right eye, but the hospital said I needed another one to save my eye and a referral. But the second operation got cancelled because the supplies needed were in a warehouse that Israel bombed."

Imran was accompanied by his father Amin.
"The situation is very difficult," the 56-year-old explained. "People, afraid that they will be buried alive in their own homes, are sleeping in the streets. Others queue from 2am until the afternoon just to get a bag of bread at a bakery."
When it was time to cross, Amin was turned back as he did not have his passport with him. While patients required only their identification cards, issued by the Israeli military, those travelling with the injured needed their passports to cross.
For Imran, saying goodbye to his family was especially hard.
"I don't know whether they will be alive or dead by the time I get back," he said. "I just hope life gets better for everyone in Gaza."

Gaza's Indonesian hospital 'out of service', overwhelmed with wounded

The Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza has gone 'completely out of service' due to a lack of supplies and an overwhelming number of patients amid Israel's assault on the besieged territory, hospital director Atef al-Kahlout has said.
Footage from the hospital in Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip shows wounded Palestinians lining the hallways of the facility and laying prone amid amid pools of blood.
'We cannot offer any more services we can't offer patients any beds,' al-Kahlout told Al Jazeera on Thursday.
While the hospital has a capacity of 140 patients, al-Kahlout said some 500 patients are currently inside the hospital.
He said 45 patients are in need of 'urgent surgical intervention', and called on ambulances 'not to bring anymore wounded people' to the facility due to the lack of capacity.
He says the hospital's departments are 'unable to carry out their work'.
Health workers at the hospital cited a a critical shortage of supplies.
'We don't have beds,' a health worker told Al Jazeera on a tour of the building.
'This person needs an intensive care unit,' he added pointing to a young man lying on the ground while being tended by a nurse.
'And [here],' he says pointing to another patient with an amputated leg, 'we have no medicine.'
'We receive wounded people from Wadi Gaza to Beit Hanoun,' he says, 'some have been here for ten days.'

Nearly 30,000 Palestinians have been wounded since Israel began its assault on Gaza on October 7 after Hamas carried out a surprise attack on southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
More than 11,400 people have been killed, including more than 4,600 children, in the Israeli assault on Gaza, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israel has also   supplies of water, food,  , with aid agencies warning of a humanitarian catastrophe in the enclave.
'Medical teams [at the Indonesian hospital] were forced to amputate some patients due to the rotting of the organs,' Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Khan Younis, adding that the hospital is unable to transfer the injured elsewhere.
'All hospitals in Gaza City and the north have stopped operating,' director al-Kahlout said.
The Indonesian Hospital, located near the Jabalia refugee camp - the largest in Gaza - has also been sheltering hundreds of displaced people who sought shelter there.
The vicinity of the hospital had been struck multiple times by Israeli forces, with at least two civilians killed in those strikes between October 7 and 28, according to Human Rights Watch.
Israel's military has alleged the Indonesian Hospital is used 'to hide an underground command and control centre' for Hamas. Palestinian officials and the Indonesian group that funds the hospital have rejected the claims.
Meanwhile, concerns are growing for the thousands of civilians trapped at   hospital, Gaza's largest medical complex, amid an ongoing Israeli raid. Israel says the hospital harbours a Hamas command centre, a claim the group has denied.
White House spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday the US was 'confident in our own intelligence assessment' that Hamas has been using the hospital 'as a command and control node, and most likely as well as a storage facility."
Late on Thursday, the Israeli army published videos it said showed a Hamas tunnel shaft and a vehicle 'containing a large number of weapons' uncovered at Gaza's Al Shifa hospital complex.

'From friend to enemy': Palestinians in Israel suspended from jobs over war

October 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
On Saturday, October 7, Noura* went to work as usual early in the morning at the hospital in Israel where she's been employed for more than two years.
The Palestinian health care professional had taken a quick glance at the news, but in the rush to make it to work in time, she had not fully understood the magnitude of what was happening in the country: an attack by the Palestinian armed group Hamas on southern Israel that would leave   in Israel dead. In response, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has launched a deadly bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 2,300 Palestinians, and enforced a   on the enclave, blocking supplies of food, medicines and fuel. A ground invasion appears imminent.
But on Saturday morning, Noura had no knowledge of any of this. Palestinian armed groups periodically fire rockets into southern Israel that are mostly intercepted by the country's missile defence system, known as the  .
So, when a visibly shaken co-worker spoke to Noura about what had happened, she responded by telling her, 'This is not the first time' — a response she now recognises lacked empathy.
But as more details began to come through, and the unprecedented nature of the attack became clearer, Noura was summoned to her manager's office, told to leave her work and not come back until further notice - because of that earlier conversation with her colleague.
'I felt very insulted, I couldn't believe this is happening to me,' said Noura, who is one of 1.2 million Palestinians who are citizens of Israel - about 20 percent of the country's population.
'I feel  ,' she continued. 'Day by day, you don't feel it. But you feel it when something like this happens. You know that automatically you turn from a friend to an enemy.'
Shortly afterwards, she received a letter from the hospital's management, which Al Jazeera has reviewed, in which she was called to a hearing to formalise her suspension on grounds that she had violated the institution's disciplinary code, by allegedly supporting the Hamas attack.
Noura denied ever uttering the words she was accused of saying.
'What insulted me the most is that when they called me for the meeting, they had their mind set, the decision had been made. They didn't want to listen,' Noura said of the hearing, which is expected soon.
She spoke to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because, despite everything, she hopes to be able to be heard fairly and keep her job.
'Dozens' of complaints
Noura is not alone. Lawyers and human rights organisations in Israel have received dozens of complaints from both workers and students who, since last Saturday, have been abruptly suspended from schools, universities and workplaces over social media posts or, in some cases, conversations with colleagues.
Letters sent by some of their institutes or offices, reviewed by Al Jazeera, cited posts written on social media and alleged support for 'terrorism' as the reason for the immediate suspension 'until the matter is investigated'. In some cases, recipients have been summoned to appear before a disciplinary committee.
'People who have been working for three, four, five years found themselves getting letters saying don't come to work because of what you published,' Hassan Jabareen, the director of Adalah, the Legal Centre for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, told Al Jazeera from Haifa, a city in the country's north.
In some of the cases, 'they say hearings will be held at a later date, but they don't [specify] when,' he said. 'The hearing should be held before you get the decision.'
Adalah is aware of at least a dozen workers who were suspended since last Saturday in similar circumstances, mostly over social media posts. It also received  complaints from around 40 Palestinian students at Israeli universities and colleges who have received letters of expulsion or suspension from their institutions.
Wehbe Badarni, director of the Arab Workers' Union in the northern city of Nazareth, also told Al Jazeera that the union is following up on more than 35 complaints, including students as well as workers in hospitals, hotels, gas stations, restaurants and call centres.
In one letter seen by Al Jazeera, a company had summoned an employee to a telephone hearing to 'examine the possibility of terminating the employment with the company' over 'posts that support terrorist activity and incitement'.
'Incitement to terrorism is a serious charge that would need to be proven in court,' said Salam Irsheid, a lawyer with Adalah. 'In our opinion, what is happening right now is not legal.'
'Atmosphere of terror'
Another health worker Al Jazeera spoke to in Tel Aviv said he was doing everything he could to keep a low profile, for fear of retribution. 'No one is talking about the situation, I'm being faced with grumpy and angry faces every morning considering I am the only Palestinian working there,' he told Al Jazeera.
'The news is horrifying but when I'm at work I try to put a face that everything is just news. I can't really express or talk about what's going on,' he said. 'Since the last war [in 2021] everyone is keeping a low profile.'
Physicians for Human Rights Israel, a non-profit founded more than three decades ago in Jaffa, has handled several cases of suspensions of medical workers since 2021, after the last war between Hamas and Israel, according to board chairperson Dr Lina Qassem Hasan.
In one high-profile case , Ahmad Mahajna, a doctor at Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital, was suspended for offering sweets to a Palestinian teenager who was under police custody at the hospital, where he was being treated for gunshot wounds after an alleged attack. 'There is an atmosphere of terror, people are afraid,' Dr Qassem told Al Jazeera.
She was scheduled to go on a bi-monthly visit to Gaza with her human rights group on October 12. That visit by physicians and psychologists this month was cancelled after the Hamas attack. Instead, she found herself treating patients evacuated from their homes in southern Israel.
A local radio station interviewed her on her visit. 'In this interview, I said that what Hamas did is a war crime in my eyes, and also that I see that what Israel does in Gaza is a war crime,' she said.
'Two hours after the interview, I got a call from my employer,' she said. She wasn't asked to stop speaking to the media, but 'it was like a warning for me that I have to be careful, you know, that [they] follow what [I] do.'
Palestinian citizens of Israel have historically faced systemic discrimination, including chronic underinvestment in their communities and — according to Adalah — more than 50 laws that are  .
Yet 'racism has accelerated' further, attorney Sawsan Zaher told Al Jazeera. 'What we are seeing now is something that we haven't seen before.'
'The mere fact that you express your opinion, even if it's not necessarily incitement based on the criminal code… it's enough now to express any kind of support for not only Hamas, but the Palestinian people,' she added.
Zaher said people were increasingly 'afraid to speak Arabic' in public.
Keeping her head down is what Noura usually does too, she said.
'In every situation where there is an incident or something that happens, we try not to talk about it at all. We try to just to forget it, put it in the back of our heads because we know we will get judged if we say a word,' Noura said.
'This time, it was my mistake that I replied.'
*Name has been changed at the person's request to prevent potential retribution.

Iran and Israel: From allies to archenemies, how did they get here?

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Tehran, Iran – Iran has emerged as one of the most strident voices against the brutal Israeli bombardment of Gaza. And that's in line with its staunch anti-Israel foreign policy. The two Middle Eastern nations are often described as archenemies.
The Palestinian issue has been at the centre of the hostilities for decades, and Tehran has been   and its closest ally, the United States, that the war with Hamas could spread as Tel Aviv has escalated attacks beyond Gaza. Israel has bombed positions in Lebanon and Syria, two countries where Tehran wields considerable influence.
Here's a quick look at the history of relations between Iran and Israel, and where things stand now.
How did relations between modern-day Iran and Israel begin?
Under the Pahlavi dynasty, which ruled from 1925 until it was overthrown in the 1979 revolution, ties between Iran and Israel were anything but hostile. Iran was, in fact, the second Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel after it was founded in 1948.
Iranwas one of the 11 members of the special United Nations committee that was formed in 1947 to devise a solution for Palestine after the   of the territory ended. It was one of three to vote against the UN's partition plan for Palestine, centred on concerns that it would escalate violence in the region for generations to come.
"Iran, alongside India and Yugoslavia, came up with an alternative plan, a federative solution which was about keeping Palestine as one state with one parliament but divided into Arab and Jewish cantons," University of Oxford historian Eirik Kvindesland told Al Jazeera.
"That was Iran's compromise to try to maintain positive relations with a pro-Zionist West and the Zionist movement itself, and also with its Arab and Muslim neighbouring countries."
But two years after Israel managed to capture more territory than the UN had approved following the start of the first Arab-Israeli War in 1948, Iran – then under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the second Pahlavi king or shah – became the second Muslim-majority nation after Turkey to officially recognise Israel. Leading up to Israel's establishment in 1948, more than 700,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homes by  . Palestinians call their forced displacement and dispossession the Nakba, Arabic for catastrophe.
Kvindesland said Tehran's move was mainly to manage Iranian assets in Palestine as about 2,000 Iranians lived there and had their properties confiscated by the Israeli army during the war.
But it also happened in the context of Israel's so-called "periphery doctrine".
"To end its isolation in the Middle East, Israel's Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion pursued relations with non-Arab states at the 'edges' of the Middle East, in what would later become known as the periphery doctrine. This also included Ethiopia, but Iran and Turkey were by far the most successful approaches," Kvindesland said.
Things changed after Mohammad Mosaddegh became Iran's prime minister in 1951 when he spearheaded the nationalisation of the country's oil industry, which was monopolised by Britain. Mosaddegh severed ties with Israel, which he saw as serving Western interests in the region.
According to Kvindesland, Mosaddegh and his National Front political organisation's efforts to nationalise oil, kick out the British colonial power and weaken the monarchy were the main story for Iran at the time. Its ties with Israel were "collateral damage", he says.
"There was some anti-Zionist mobilisation inside Iran. There was [influential Shia cleric] Navvab Safavi, one of the most famous characters who propagated strongly against Zionism and the establishment of Israel. But for Mosaddegh, the main aim was to gain support from surrounding Arab states to combat British control over the oil industry," Kvindesland told Al Jazeera.
Zionism emerged as a political ideology in the late 19th century that called for the creation of a homeland for Jews who faced atrocities in Europe.
Things dramatically shifted when Mosaddegh's government was overthrown in a coup organised by the intelligence services of the United Kingdom and the United States in 1953. The coup reinstated the shah who became a staunch ally of the West in the region.
Israel established a de facto embassy in Tehran, and eventually the two exchanged ambassadors in the 1970s. Trade ties grew, and soon Iran became a major oil provider for Israel, with the two establishing a pipelineaimed at sending Iranian oil to Israel and then Europe.
Tehran and Tel Aviv also had extensive military and security cooperation, but it was largely kept under wraps to avoid provoking the Arab nations in the region.
"Israel needed Iran more than Iran needed Israel. It was always Israel that was the proactive party, but the shah also wanted a way to improve its [Iran's] relations with the US, and at the time Israel was seen as a good way to achieve that aim," Kvindesland said.
"There was also the prospect of building up the security apparatus, and the [Iranian security and intelligence service] SAVAK was partly trained by Mossad. These were things Iran could get from elsewhere, but Israel was keen to provide them because it needed a partner in the Middle East that was otherwise fairly anti-Zionist and anti-Israel."
The historian said the Shah was mainly driven by the need for alliances, security and trade, and "showed little concern for the Palestinians in his dealings with Israel."
What happened after Iran's revolution?
In 1979, the shah was overthrown in a revolution, and a new Islamic Republic of Iran was born.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution, brought about a new worldview that predominantly championed Islam and argued for standing up to 'arrogant' world powers and their regional allies, who would oppress others - including Palestinians - to serve their own interests.
This meant that Israel became known in Iran as the 'Little Satan' to the 'Great Satan' that is the US.
Tehran cut off all ties with Israel; citizens could no longer travel and flight routes were cancelled; and the Israeli embassy in Tehran was transformed into the Palestinian embassy.
Khomeini also declared every last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan as Quds Day, and ever since large rallies have been held on that day in support of Palestinians across Iran. Jerusalem is known as al-Quds in Arabic.
Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, told Al Jazeera that Khomeini pushed against framing the Palestinian issue as an Arab nationalist cause and sought to transform it into an Islamic cause in order to provide Iran with not only the ability to champion the Palestinian cause but to lead it.
"To overcome both the Arab-Persian divide and the Sunni-Shia divide, Iran adopted a much more aggressive position on the Palestinian issue to brandish its leadership credentials in the Islamic world and to put Arab regimes allied with the United States on the defensive," he said.
The enmity grew over the decades as both sides sought to cement and grow their power and influence across the region.
Now, Iran supports a 'resistance axis' network of political and armed groups in several countries across the region, including in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, who also support the Palestinian cause and view Israel as a major enemy.
Over the years, Israel has backed a variety of groups who are violently opposed to the Iranian establishment. Tehran says these have included a number of groups it designates as 'terrorist' organisations. Among them are the  , a Europe-based organization, Sunni organisations in Iran's southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province, and  .
How have they clashed?
Tensions between Iran and Israel have not been limited to ideologies or proxy groups.
The two are alleged to be behind a long series of attacks on each other's interests within and outside their soils, which they publicly deny. This has become known as a 'shadow war' that has increasingly spilt out into the open as hostilities grew.
Iran's nuclear programme has been at the centre of some of the largest attacks. Israel - itself thought to clandestinely possess dozens of nuclear weapons - has vowed to never let Iran develop a  . Tehran has reiterated that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes.
Israel and the US are widely believed to be behind the Stuxnet malware that inflicted major damage on Iran's nuclear facilities in the 2000s.
Over the years, there have beenmany  on Iran's nuclear and military facilities that Tehran has blamed Israel for. Iran also regularly publicises news of foiling more sabotage attacks.
The attacks have also targeted personnel, including a series of high-profile nuclear scientists. The most brazen assassination came in 2020 when top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was gunned down using a satellite-monitored, AI-controlled   mounted on the back of a pickup truck that later exploded to destroy evidence.
On the other hand, Israel and its Western allies accuse Iran of being behind a series of attacks on Israeli interests, including several drone  and cyberattacks.
Could there ever be normalisation?
Several Arab states in the region have chosen to normalise their relations with Israel as they seek more Western support.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, the other powerhouse in the region, this year   with Iranafter a seven-year rift following an agreement brokered by China in March.
The US has been trying to mediate a similar deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Any prospect of normalisation between Tel Aviv and Riyadh has been put on hold, at least for now, as Israel continues to bomb Gaza, having already caused a humanitarian nightmare and killing nearly 10,000 people, one-third of them children.
But for the current establishment in Iran, any rapprochement with Israel is out of the question.
Parsi said common security imperatives that in earlier decades had led the two to become allies, including the threat from Arab nationalist states and the Soviet empire, vanished in the early 1990s.
Tehran opposes US hegemony in the Middle East while Israel has consistently pushed back against any efforts in Washington to bring American troops home from the region. Iran-linked groups have regularly attacked US bases in Iraq and Syria.
It's a "rivalry for dominance and power in the region, the two states have been embroiled in a low-level war for more than a decade," said Parsi.
There are no signs of that changing.

On Sunday, the third day of the truce between Hamas and Israel, both communities appeared to have gotten used to the guns being silent and captives being released.
The first releases of the captives, on Friday, were tense as the procedures were unknown to all. Expectations were high and all waited for those first groups to get home. By Saturday, the media on both sides of the divide was inundated with emotional scenes of families reuniting and embracing their dearest.
At one point on Saturday, it looked like fresh celebrations might have to be postponed – Hamas announced that it would not release the second batch of captives because Israel was not respecting the truce deal.
Israeli forces were shooting at Palestinians trying to reach their homes, Israel was not releasing prisoners according to the agreed guidelines and, most importantly, aid deliveries were short of targets set in the agreement. Hamas warned that unless the agreed number of trucks enter the Strip, with a significant number taking supplies north to what remains of Gaza City, there would be no release.
Qatari and Egyptian diplomats immediately went into overdrive and a frenzy of phone calls and emails is reported to have ensued. In a couple of hours, assurances acceptable to Hamas that the agreed number of aid trucks would get to Gaza before the truce expires on Tuesday morning were issued, and the captives were released late in the evening, the Palestinian detainees minutes later.
The two divided communities took to the streets to vent 50 days of fear, anxiety and frustration in mass displays of emotion. In Tel Aviv, 100,000 Israelis rejoiced, half an hour's drive away in Ramallah, Palestinians went around town singing and dancing. The celebrations repeated on Sunday.
Saturday clearly demonstrated how much the world wants and needs this truce to succeed. Even limited as it is, and only four days, it is nevertheless the first positive development since October 7 and the international community is eager to extend it, hoping to make it permanent. We have heard that efforts are ongoing, although no details have leaked yet, but I am certain that the success of brokering the current truce encouraged countries to express to the warring sides, either directly or through Qatar and Egypt, their desire for the conflict to end and support for any deal the parties reach.
 
So strong is the desire for a feeble, limited pause to become a more lasting cessation of hostilities, that any inconvenience that could mar it is pushed aside, minimised or ignored. Like the Israeli forces killing of eight Palestinians in the occupied West Bank on Sunday. It made the news but nobody, Palestinian authorities included, pushed for the condemnation of the perpetrators or raised the issue with any international organisation. The truce seemed more precious than a few civilian lives.
Even before the fighting paused Friday morning, it was clear that the warring sides and regional powers agreed that it should be given a chance and not be upset by any irresponsible act. The biggest worries were that Hezbollah, or the Houthis might continue or even step up their attacks on Israel, endangering the fragile ceasefire. Neither group was party to the agreement, so they did not have any obligation to honour it.
Again, as several times earlier during the last seven weeks, Iran stepped in with uncharacteristic delicacy. To make sure Hezbollah would not do anything reckless, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian flew to Lebanon on Thursday, as pre-truce bombardments were still ongoing, to meet with Hezbollah head Hassan Nasrallah. Tehran's message was clear, and the minister repeated it to the media: If the then-tentative truce is not observed, 'the scope of the war will expand'.
Known for its effective command and disciplined officers and soldiers, Hezbollah clearly decided to conduct itself as its mentors expected. Only one incident was reported, on Saturday, when Hezbollah fired a missile at an Israeli observation drone over Lebanese territory. Israel retaliated with artillery fire directed at the missile site but it seems that neither side wanted to escalate further.
The Houthis were not subject to the same degree of attention from Tehran, so they showed less restraint. New missile launches against Israel – 2,000km (1,240 miles) away – were recorded after the start of the truce. No projectile managed to get through the multilayered defences consisting of US Navy destroyers in the Red Sea, an Israeli navy corvette in international waters at the top of the Gulf of Aqaba and Israeli air force aircraft ready to intercept anything that manages to squeeze through the shipborne defences.
In a further escalation, the Houthis continued threatening cargo ships with alleged links to Israel. Just days after hijacking the Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader, on Saturday their armed drones attacked the Malta-flagged CMA CGM Symi without attempting to board it, unlike the next incident on Sunday when they first attacked from the air and then tried to hijack the Central Park, flying the Liberian flag. US Navy destroyer USS Mason, patrolling the Gulf of Aden, intervened, forcing the attackers to flee the ship.
The Houthis, known for tenacity and aggressiveness, obviously do not feel obliged to refrain from attacking what they see as Israeli assets, so it is a blessing that their arsenal appears unable to mar the current agreement.
After three days of quiet and captives from both sides coming home, we should remind ourselves that this almost idyllical respite is only scheduled to last until Tuesday and that in less than 24 hours, explosions will again rock the Gaza Strip and more people, civilians and soldiers, will be killed.
As the expiry of the truce neared, both sides toyed with the possibility of extension. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, venturing into Gaza territory for a brief propaganda photo op amid heavy security, hinted that the truce could be extended if Hamas continued releasing hostages and that every group of 10 would buy another day of pause. Hamas told the Reuters news agency that it is seeking to extend the truce but wanted more Palestinians freed from Israeli jails.
While something might be cooking under a tightfitting lid and civilians in Palestine and Israel seem hypnotised by three days of 'peace', soldiers and politicians remind them that it is only a pause after which the fighting is scheduled to continue. Chief of General Staff General Herzi Halevi said on Sunday that once the pause expires, his forces 'will return to our operations with determination, for the continued release of the hostages and the complete dismantlement of Hamas'. The message was repeated by Netanyahu later as he vowed to continue 'until victory'.
Barring some last-minute miracle, it will be legal for both sides to resume military activities at 7am sharp on Tuesday 28 November. I have never seen a ceasefire last until the agreed-upon moment: Usually, they are either extended by an agreement made while they still last or they are broken before the deadline.
In the absence of an official extension, it is very likely that fighting might resume on Monday night after the last batches of hostages are out and the last aid trucks are in. Realising that the last prisoner exchange is over, soldiers might not see a need to wait for hours until the official expiration. Any shot fired at or near the current front lines on Monday night will probably signal to every fighter to return to war with all his might.
The only way to prevent the unravelling of the truce is to announce its extension before the last captives are freed on Monday.

After outcry over Ukraine, big business muted on Israel-Hamas war

When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, the corporate world's response was loud and clear.
Corporate giants from Adidas and Disney, to Bank of America and Toyota, pledged financial and moral support for Ukraine and Ukrainians. CEOs including Apple's Tim Cook and Citi Group's Jane Fraser sported Ukrainian flag lapels in solidarity.
Many firms, including oil behemoth ExxonMobil and household goods brand Unilever, condemned Moscow in explicit terms.
More than 1,000 companies ultimately pledged to cease or scale back business in Russia as perceptions of Moscow soured globally.
The response of big business to the Israel-Hamas conflict has been muted in comparison.
Many household name brands that adopted a vocal stance on the Ukraine war have declined to weigh in on the Middle East conflict.
Those that have – such as Microsoft, Google, Hewlett Packard, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs – have expressed support for Israel and condemned Hamas over the armed group's multipronged attack on Saturday, which killed at least 1,300 people and injured about 3,400.
By contrast, major corporations have been silent on Israel's retaliatory air raids on Gaza, which so far have killed at least 1,799 Palestinians and injured more than 6,300.
The United Nations and aid groups have further warned of a coming humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza after Israel   trapped in the enclave to move south within 24 hours ahead of an expected ground offensive.

For companies known for touting their social justice credentials, the Israel-Palestine conflict represents a particularly challenging issue to weigh in on due to the sensitivities and complex dynamics involved, according to marketing experts.
Rahat Kapur, editor of the industry publication Campaign Asia, said the level of historical complexity and nuance involved in the conflict makes companies wary of inserting themselves and engaging in 'brandification'.
'There's a temptation to issue binary points of view in order to show fervor and strength, which oftentimes backfires when their following or consumer base is able to see through these efforts,' Kapur told Al Jazeera.
'Similarly, performative brand stances in social areas can often lead to more backlash, unprecedented reputation damage and overnight loss of customer sentiment and loyalty, which are all incredibly difficult, time-consuming and costly to recover.'
Showing support for Palestine in particular is likely to be a risky move for companies in Western countries, many of which describe Hamas as a "terrorist" group.
Expressions of solidarity in countries such as the United States and United Kingdom have been largely confined to small organisations like student associations and the Green Brigade of Celtic Football Club supporters.
In the US, pro-Palestinian rallies during the past week have faced heavy blowback from critics who have accused organisers of justifying Hamas violence.
France has banned all pro-Palestinian protests outright on public order grounds, while Germany, Australia, the Netherlands and the UK have warned or restricted pro-Palestine groups accused of supporting Hamas or advocating anti-Jewish views.
'Israel's countermeasure under the name Operation Swords of Iron has, since Monday, resulted in the death of hundreds of Palestinians, many of whom were children,' Carl Rhodes, the dean of the University of Technology Sydney's Business School, told Al Jazeera.
'There has been no noticeable response from Western corporations, whose actions appear more political than genuinely humanitarian.'

Big business has also faced criticism for not mounting a stronger condemnation of the deadliest attack inside Israel since the country's founding.
Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt told CNN in an interview this week that the response of corporate America had been 'disappointing at best, disastrous at worst'.
Consumers themselves have given ambivalent signals about whether they favour companies weighing in on social and political matters.
In a 2019 survey by Sprout Social, more than two-thirds of American consumers said it is 'important for brands to take a public stance on social and political issues'.
However, just over half said they would boycott brands that did not 'align with their own views' while 34 percent said they would reduce their spending on them.
In 2020, a poll by the Pew Research Center found that 55 percent of American social media users felt 'worn out' by political posts in general.
Felipe Thomaz, an associate professor of marketing at Oxford's Said Business School, said perceptions of companies' social justice campaigns often come down to individuals' personal beliefs and values.
'We use brands as a way to communicate things about ourselves, so it's reasonable to want brands to reflect your opinion about the world,' Thomaz told Al Jazeera.
Thomaz said the stakes are especially high during war, which is why brands often prefer to stick to general comments decrying violence or say nothing at all.
'When brands take a stance that is opposite to the majority of its users, that statement becomes an attack on their identity, and they revolt. So it's risky,' he said.

First fuel truck since start of Israel-Hamas war enters Gaza

The first truck delivering fuel to the Gaza Strip since the war began has arrived in the besieged enclave.
The diesel fuel truck arrived in Gaza via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Wednesday. However, it is "not at all enough", the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said, adding that use of the fuel has been "restricted" by Israel.
"Just received 23,027 LT [6,083 gallons] of fuel from Egypt (half a tanker) - but its use has been restricted by Israeli authorities – only for transporting aid from Rafah," Tom White, the director of UNRWA Affairs in the Gaza Strip, said in a post on X.
"No fuel for water or hospitals. This is only 9% of what we need daily to sustain lifesaving activities," he continued.
"This is the equivalent of half a truck! Not at all enough. Much more is needed. Fuel is being used as weapon of war, this must stop," UNRWA said on X.

Israel has imposed a total siege on Gaza since attacks last month in southern Israel by Hamas. Limited deliveries of humanitarian aid have been crossing from Egypt into Gaza since October 21, but Israel had refused to let any fuel enter.
On Tuesday, it gave approval for 24,000 litres (6,340 gallons) of diesel to be allowed into Gaza, but it is meant only for UN trucks and not for Gaza's hospitals, which are shutting down because they have no fuel to power their generators.
The fuel was delivered to the UN "to facilitate the delivery of aid after trucks on the Palestinian side stopped operating for lack of fuel", an Egyptian source told the Agence France-Presse news agency.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence unit that handles Palestinian civilian affairs had said earlier: "UN trucks transporting humanitarian aid through the Rafah crossing will be refuelled at the Rafah crossing, per US request."
Fuel shortages have already caused or contributed to the closure of hospitals, bakeries, sewage pumping stations, water desalination plants and water wells and are threatening to shut down telecommunication data centres and connection points within 48 hours, the UN said on Tuesday.
Gaza's two main telecommunications companies, Paltel and Jawwal, warned on Wednesday of a "complete telecom blackout in the coming hours" in the Gaza Strip due to a lack of fuel.
Our entire operation is now on the verge of collapse.
By the end of today, around 70 % of the population in #Gaza  won't have access to clean water.
To have fuel for trucks only will not save lives anymore. Waiting longer will cost lives.
- Philippe Lazzarini (@UNLazzarini) November 15, 2023
After the first fuel truck entered, witnesses told media two more were waiting on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing, but it was unclear when they might enter.
"To have fuel for trucks only will not save lives," Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general of UNRWA, said in a post on X. "Our entire operation is now on the verge of collapse. By the end of today, around 70% of the population in Gaza won't have access to clean water."
Aid agencies in Gaza say a chronic lack of fuel has hampered efforts to deliver food, water and medicine to Palestinians in Gaza, which is under siege as Israel wages a war that has killed at least 11,200 people.
Israel's bombardment and ground offensive followed the Hamas attacks on October 7, which killed 1,200 Israelis.
On Tuesday, 91 trucks carrying food, medicine, bottled water, blankets and tents entered Gaza from Egypt, but the UN says deliveries since October 21 – 1,187 trucks in total – can meet only a fraction of Gaza's needs.
Distribution of the aid had largely come to a halt because of lack of fuel, it said.

US police probe death of Jewish man at pro-Palestinian, pro-Israel rallies

Police in the United States have announced they are investigating the death of an elderly Jewish man at competing pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian rallies as a homicide.
Paul Kessler, 69, died on Monday after falling and striking his head after a confrontation during duelling demonstrations in Thousand Oaks, northwest of Los Angeles, authorities said.
Ventura County Sheriff's Department said authorities had not ruled out the possibility that a hate crime had taken place.
'Witness accounts indicated that Kessler was involved in a physical altercation with counter-protestor(s),' the sheriff's office said. 'During the altercation, Kessler fell backwards and struck his head on the ground.'
The sheriff's office said that it had not taken any suspect into custody following the incident, which appeared 'to be isolated and not part of a large effort'.
Footage on social media appeared to show Kessler lying on the ground bleeding and holding his head.
The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles said in a statement on social media that Kessler had been struck in the head by a megaphone wielded by a pro-Palestinian protester and it would not tolerate 'violence against our community'. The group did not provide a source for its claim.
Michael Barclay, a local rabbi, urged the public against jumping to conclusions about the incident.
'I just got off the phone with the Chief of Police,' Barclay said on X, formerly Twitter.
'They have conflicting reports of what happened, and they did interview the suspect that is identified in social media at the event. They have no video.'
The incident comes a month after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
Israel's bombardment of Gaza in response has killed more than 10,000 people, according to the Ministry of Health in the Hamas-governed enclave.

EU to boost Gaza aid amid Israel-Hamas truce

The European Commission will step up aid deliveries to Gaza during the agreed four-day pause in Israel's war.
 , Ursula von der Leyen, chief of the EU's executive body, said the bloc will use the window to get more humanitarian into the Palestinian enclave.
"The European Commission will do its utmost to use this pause for a humanitarian surge to Gaza," she said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that "I wholeheartedly welcome the agreement".
Tamer Qarmout, assistant professor in public policy at the Doha Institute, told Al Jazeera that the most important thing that needs to be addressed during the pause is the catastrophic humanitarian condition in Gaza.
'It's about food and shelter. Winter is here in Gaza, people are sleeping outside, and there's nothing to cover them. So it's a disaster. Aid needs to be increased and the international community need to push Israel on this,' Qarmout said.
'No evidence'
Von der Leyen's comments came a day after the commission announced a review of its development aid to Palestinians – ordered after the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas – found no evidence of funds going to the armed group that rules Gaza.
"The review found no indications of EU money having directly or indirectly benefitted the terrorist organisation Hamas," Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday.
The EU is the biggest provider of development aid to Palestinians. It has earmarked about 1.2 billion euros ($1.3bn) for its programmes for the period between 2021 and 2024.
Brussels was forced, in the wake of the October 7 attacks, to deny it would cut all aid to Gaza in October, following a statement bythe Hungarian-nominated commissioner for neighbourhood and enlargement.
Oliver Varhelyi stated on social media that "all payments" to the Palestinians had been "immediately suspended" and that "all new budget proposals," including for 2023, had been "postponed until further notice".
The scale of terror and brutality against #Israel  and its people is a turning point.
There can be no business as usual.
As the biggest donor of the Palestinians, the European Commission is putting its full development portfolio under review, worth a total of EUR 691m
️
- Oliver Varhelyi (@OliverVarhelyi) October 9, 2023
The commission scrambled to clarify that Varhelyi's statement was not official and that humanitarian funds would continue to flow, while an "urgent review" would be conducted regarding development assistance that was earmarked but not yet disbursed.
Development aid is used for projects designed to have a long-term impact, such as paying the salaries of officials at the Palestinian Authority, which governs the occupied West Bank, and the work of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA.
It is separate from humanitarian aid, meant for urgent needs for essentials such as food, water and shelter.
"The review found that the control system in place has worked. As a result payment to Palestinian beneficiaries and UNRWA will continue without any delays," Dombrovskis told reporters.
The commission said, however, that it would not proceed with plans to provide 75.6 million euros ($82.5m) for Gaza infrastructure projects that were not "feasible in the current context".
That money will now go to other projects after Israel launched its heavy bombardment of Gaza following the October 7 attacks.
The enclave's Hamas-run government says at least 14,100 Palestinians have been confirmed killed during Israel's aerial blitz and invasion. In Israel, the official death toll from Hamas's attacks stands at about 1,200.

Illinois man pleads not guilty in killing of Palestinian-American boy

A man accused of murder, attempted murder and a hate crime in an attack on a Palestinian-American woman and her young son has pleaded not guilty following his indictment by a grand jury in Illinois in the United States.
Joseph Czuba, 71, is charged in the   Wadea Al-Fayoume and the wounding of Hanaan Shahin on October 14. Authorities said the victims were targeted because of their Muslim faith and as a response to the  .
Shahin told police that Czuba, her landlord in Plainfield in Will County, was upset over the war and attacked them after she had urged him to 'pray for peace'.
Czuba appeared in court Monday wearing a red jail uniform, socks and yellow rubber slippers.
His attorney George Lenard entered the not guilty plea after the judge read the eight-count indictment. Czuba did not speak, looking down at the podium with his hands folded behind his back as he stood before the judge in the court in Joliet, 80km (50 miles) southwest of Chicago.
Shahin, 32, is recovering from multiple stab wounds. Hundreds of people attended her son's October 16 funeral, where he was remembered as an energetic boy who loved playing games. He had recently had a birthday.
The boy's father and other family members attended the hearing. They declined to speak to reporters.
The murder charge in the indictment against Czuba describes the boy's death as the result of 'exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior'. The attack on the family — which renewed anti-Islamic fears in the Chicago area's large and established Palestinian community — has drawn condemnation from the White House.
Judge David Carlson ruled that Czuba will remain detained as he awaits a January 8 court hearing.
In arguing to keep Czuba detained, Will County Assistant State's Attorney Michael Fitzgerald said Czuba was a danger to Shahin and others. 'We also believe he is a threat to the safety of the community,' he said.
Czuba's attorneys disagreed, citing Czuba's age and the fact that he is a veteran without any criminal convictions. Lenard and Fitzgerald declined to comment to reporters after the hearing.
Shahin asked the public to "pray for peace" and said her son was her best friend in a statement issued last week through the Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
The attack comes amid rising hostility against Muslim and Jewish communities in the US since October 7, when Hamas attacked Israel and Israel began bombarding Gaza.

"I cannot be happy with just this win, with what is happening. I'm sorry guys, it's supposed to be about tennis, but it's very frustrating looking at videos every day.
"I'm sorry - it's not a political message, it's just humanity. I want peace in this world and that's it."
Following the on-court interview, Jabeur was visibly upset in her post-match press conference as well and said she had been finding it difficult to get much sleep after watching "horrible" photos and videos from the war in Gaza.
"I try to stay off social media as much as I can but it's very tough," she told reporters.
"You go through horrible photos and videos every day - it doesn't let me sleep or recover very well.
"The worst thing is I feel hopeless, I feel like cannot do anything."
The world's seventh-ranked women's singles player said she has been affected by "seeing babies, women and people dying every day".
"I wish [for] peace in this world, I wish we could restore humanity."
At least 8,796 people, including 3,648 children and 2,290 women   by an Israeli bombardment since the Palestinian armed group Hamas carried out deadly attacks in Israel on October 7.
'Winning a tennis match doesn't mean anything'
Jabeur is the only Arab and Muslim player to have qualified for a women's singles Grand Slam final.
The Tunisian found plenty of support in the crowd at Cancun, including a young fan who shouted: "I started playing tennis because of you, Ons."
Jabeur said it was an honour for her to receive such warmth although she came "from very far away [from Mexico]."
However, she said winning a tennis match "doesn't mean anything in front of what's been happening for weeks and weeks [in Gaza]".
"I wish could wave a magic wand and just end this and have peace for everybody."
Despite pledging to donate a part of her prize money to Palestinians, Jabeur said she knew it wouldn't "mean anything to them right now" but hoped it would help a little bit with what they have been going through.
She revealed plans to start her own foundation "very soon" and hoped it would help people "in different situations".
"It's part of my plan to be not just an athlete but also a good ambassador and a good human being because after all, the tennis career will stop and all I want to do is to help people in different situations."

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - Cosme Felippsen's nephew was 17 years old when he was killed by Brazil's military police in a Rio de Janeiro alley nicknamed the  .
'Almost every favela in Rio has an area residents call Gaza,' Felippsen said, pointing to the bullet holes along the alley walls. Residents have used the name for at least 15 years, he added. 'It designates the area where most of the gunfire is concentrated at any given time.'
The neighbourhood where Felippsen's nephew, Jos Vieira, died in 2017 is called Morro da Providncia. It is one of hundreds of impoverished communities — or   — strewn across the city.
Activists and residents say   they have seen in the favelas has given them unique insight into the urban warfare currently unfolding in Gaza, a Palestinian territory under  . And the parallels they perceive are motivating them to take action.
'Militarisation, armed groups executing inhabitants — many things that happen in Palestine also happen in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro,' said Felippsen, a local politician and tour guide who specialises in Black history.

Leftist groups,some of whom haveties to Brazil's favelas,have organised protests across the country since the Israel-Hamas war began on  .
In the weeks since, more than 13,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed amid an Israeli   campaign and a   that cut off essential supplies to the densely populated territory. About 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attacks that started the war.
  that the Palestinian people are at 'grave risk of genocide'.
Adriana Odara Martins, who lives in the Baixada Fluminense neighbourhood on the outskirts of Rio, was among the protesters calling for a ceasefire in front of the local United States consulate in October.
Her community, she explained, was frequently the target of  ,and she found her experiences reflected in recent media coverage of Gaza.
'We are here in solidarity because we have empathy. We know what it is like to live under violence,' said Martins, who is part of the feminist group Articulation of Brazilian Women and a coordinator for the Unified Black Movement.
  killed more than 6,400 people last year, 83 percent of them Black, according to the nonprofit Brazilian Public Security Forum.
The violence is particularly acute in the favelas,   where a majority of residents are Black or mixed race.
Palestinians and residents of favelas are commonly perceived as 'racially subaltern populations', said Bruno Huberman, a professor of international relations at the Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo.
They share a history ofsystematic repression, expulsion from their homes, confinement in segregated spaces, subjugation and exploitation, he told Al Jazeera.
'Both populations are subjected to infinite wars: the Palestinians to the war on terror and the favela populations to the war on drugs,' Huberman said.

While hesitant to compare theviolenceafflictingthe two groups, Fatima Ouassak, a French political scientist, author and activist, said she too had noticed similarities in how favela residents and Palestinians were treated in their respective homelands.
'These populations are made to feel illegitimate where they live, as if they were not at home or welcome where they are,' she told Al Jazeera. This feeling, Ouassak added, extended to other Arab and African diaspora communities in places like France.
The perceived similarities have led some social movements in the favelas to identify explicitly with the Palestinian struggle.
Every year since 2016, activists in Rio organise "Black July", an event that brings together populations facing racism and militarisation for activities and discussions.
The issue of Palestinian rights often features in these events. This year's Black July included a webinar from two Brazilian activists — Gizele Martins and Thais Siqueira — who had recently returned from a trip to the occupied  .
'I thought we were the only ones suffering in the favelas,' Martins said during the webinar. A resident of Rio's Mar favela, she first visited the West Bank in 2017. 'As soon as I got there, I saw that everything was very similar — but much more tense.'
One of the similarities she pointed out was the   Israel constructed through Palestinian communities in the West Bank. In August, Rio de Janeiro state Governor Claudio Castro announced the construction of a wall bordering certain favelas, also in the name of security.
'Wall of shame! Rio's apartheid wall,' Martins said on Instagram after the announcement, evoking the West Bank barrier.

But the identification between the two groups has its limits.Mike, a pro-Palestinian protester who declined to give his surname, said there was more talk in support of Israel than Palestine in the favela where he resides, Barreira do Vasco.
'I sometimes feel a bit alone in backing Palestine,' Mike told Al Jazeera at the demonstration in front of the US consulate in Rio de Janeiro.
In recent years, favelas have seen a rise in  , a religious movement that identifies strongly with Israel.
Though Brazil has the largest Catholic population in the world,   is believed to be its fastest-growing religious group. Roughly 30 percent of the population identifies as evangelical.
Favelas in particular are seen as hotbeds for the church's growth, as religious leaders reach out to impoverished residents with social services like job opportunities and education.
Guilherme Casarões, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university, explained that evangelicals are more likely to sympathise with Israel due to their view that the country is a holy place to be protected.
'The idea is that Jesus Christ will only return to Earth to save humanity when the people of Jerusalem have converted to his word,' Casarões said.
That view, Casarões added, has translated into 'unconditional alignment with Israel' politically.
'Even if there is some criticism of the killing of innocent Palestinians in Gaza, the predominant view is that Israel has the right to defend itself in this battle between good and evil,' he said.

That viewpoint clashes with the stance of current left-wing President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva.
Over the past month, Lula has been sharply critical of Israel's relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip, denouncing the Palestinian bloodshed.
'This is not a war. This is a genocide,' Lula told journalists at the Planalto presidential palace in Brasilia on October 25. He also used a social media address on Tuesday to call Israel's actions 'equivalent to terrorism'.
In his previous two terms in office, from 2003 to 2010, Lula was likewise outspoken in his defence of Palestinian rights.
Latin America's biggest democracy has for decades called for a two-state solution to the conflict, one that would allow the creation of a separate Palestinian state alongside Israel.
In 2010, Lula took a step towards that goal, recognising Palestine as an independent state based on 1967 borders. The Israeli government responded with a statement expressing its 'sadness and disappointment' about the decision.
Experts say Lula's rhetoric echoes that of other  . Bolivia cut   with Israel over the war in Gaza, while Chile and Colombia have recalled their ambassadors in Tel Aviv for consultations.
By contrast, right-wing Latin American leaders have sympathized more openly with Israel, according to Casarões. They also tend to enjoy more evangelical support.
Former far-right President   stopped short of changing Brazil's longstanding support of the two-state solution, though he did make public statements denying Palestine was a country.

When Bolsonaro and Lula went head to head in the 2022 presidential race, the favela vote became key, given how narrow the margins between the two leaders were.
Residents in the favelas constitute a major voting bloc. An estimated 16 million people live in poorly resourced urban areas like favelas, and in Rio de Janeiro alone, at least a quarter of the population lives in areas considered favelas.
Lula ultimately   Bolsonaro in the final vote. In the weeks before the election, the nonprofit G10 Favelas/Favela Diz found that Lula held a seven-point lead over Bolsonaro among favela voters, with 38 percent support to the far-right leader's 31 percent.
Whether Lula's foreign policy stance will affect that support remains to be seen. But Huberman, the international relations professor, said Brazil's economy and quality of life are the biggest factors to sway the vote.
However, some Palestinian rights supporters would like to see Lula do more to address the ongoing conflict.
Fransergio Goulart, a coordinator for the Right to Memory and Racial Justice Initiative in Rio de Janeiro, said he observed Lula's popularity decreasing among his fellow activists.They felt the left-wing president was not taking a strong enough stance against Israel's military offensive.
'Lula should position himself against Israel, and he hasn't done that,' Goulart said.
Palestinian rights supporters have called on the Brazilian government to take further steps to distance itself from Israel [Apolline Guillerot-Malick/Al Jazeera]
Part of the issue is Brazil's ongoing ties to Israel's  . Brazil has long purchased weaponry and armoured vehicles from Israel to bolster its own security capabilities.
In 2013, for instance, the state of Rio de Janeiro signed an agreement with the Israeli company Global Shield to buy armoured vehicles for its military police, local newspaper Estado reported at the time.
And in October, Sao Paulo's military police showcased 7.62mm calibre Light Negev machine guns bought from Israel Weapon Industries Ltd in 2020, the local news organization Ponte reported.
This kind of weaponry has been used in the favelas in the name of combating gang violence.
'For years, military technologies   on Palestinians have been used in Brazil,' Goulart wrote in an article in March,referencing efforts to crack down on gangs in the favelas ahead of major sporting events.
Huberman noted that ties   have actually deepened when Lula's Workers' Party was in power, particularly in the area of security cooperation.
Last month, for instance, Brazil's Chamber of Deputies — with the backing of the Workers' Party — voted to renew three cooperation agreements with Israel, including one to combat organised crime.
This creates a contradiction, Huberman said, between Lula's stance on Israel's military offensives and his embrace of Israel as a domestic security partner.
'Palestinians have asked for an end to military relations [between Brazil and Israel],' Huberman said, 'because there is no point in Brazil asking for peace but buying Israeli weapons that sustain the occupation.'

State Department official resigns over Biden's handling of Israel-Gaza war

A US Department of State official has resigned over Washington's decision to   to Israel, saying the US-supported   would lead to more suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians.
Josh Paul, a director in the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, wrote in a note published online on Wednesday that the administration of President Joe Biden was repeating the same mistakes Washington has been making for decades.
'The response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people,' he wrote.
'I fear we are repeating the same mistakes we have made these past decades, and I decline to be a part of it for longer," he said, adding that the Biden administration's 'blind support for one side' was leading to policy decisions that were 'shortsighted, destructive, unjust and contradictory to the very values we publicly espouse'.
'I knew it was not without its moral complexity and moral compromises, and I made myself a promise that I would stay for as long as I felt the harm I might do could be outweighed by the good I could do,' wrote Paul who was involved in arms transfers to US allies for more than 11 years.
'I am leaving today because I believe that in our current course with regards to the continued – indeed, expanded and expedited – provision of lethal arms to Israel I have reached the end of that bargain,' he said.
In an interview with The New York Times, Paul also said that "continuing to give Israel what he described as carte blanche to kill a generation of enemies, only to create a new one, does not ultimately serve the United States' interests".
'What it leads to is this desire to sort of impose security at any cost, including in cost to the Palestinian civilian population,' he told the US publication. 'And that doesn't ultimately lead to security.'
Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza, attacked southern Israel on October 7, prompting Israel's retaliation on the besieged Palestinian enclave. The   has killed at least 1,400 people in Israel and nearly 3,500 in Gaza.
Biden visited Israel on Wednesday, showing support and giving it "the   to act as it sees fit" in Gaza.

Palestinians pack 'emergency' bags as Israeli bombs rain down on Gaza

Eman Shanti, a Palestinian woman in Gaza, has several items in her "emergency backpack", which she carries around as Israeli bombs rain down on the besieged and blockaded strip.
"So first I have lights," she says in a video posted to her Instagram account on Tuesday, pulling a torch from her bag.
"I also have dates with me, because sometimes we can be in places where we don't have access to food, so at least we have dates to eat. I also have my personal ID … and health card."
As she unzips every compartment of the bag to show her followers, the sounds of bombs are heard in the background.
"Sorry for the noise you hear … I can't afford preparing a setup in a more appropriate location," she says.
Since the war between Israel and Hamas escalated, Shanti, who works as a social media content producer in Gaza, has been posting videos and pictures regularly, portraying daily life in Gaza amid fears of an imminent   and humanitarian catastrophe.
Many Palestinians like her have become accustomed to life under Israeli bombardment and Shanti says they have a system in place, to be ready for emergencies.
"I hope that we will not have to leave or evacuate .. but from the first day of the  , we've had a system to prepare to leave our homes in case of an attack."
She says women wear prayer clothes, "which is our official uniform in an emergency situation".
These clothes, which are lightweight, comfortable and loose-fitting, are worn in case people are attacked while inside buildings. They do not want their bodies to be exposed, should they be killed or injured, and have to be retrieved from under the rubble.
In her emergency bag is a small bright green pouch containing medicine and a first aid kit. There are also Kleenex tissues, perfumed wipes, and a patterned yellow folder – in which she keeps her official identity documents.
"Hopefully we will not have to use them [documents]. But we carry them just in case we need to present them or to avoid having to get them reissued in case there's a raid," she says.
"And of course, I carry my laptop … these are the items that I put in my bag when there's a strike, and a lot of women and mothers take these items with them."
She advises women to wear their precious jewellery or carry it in the tailored pockets of prayer outfits and says it would be helpful for children to carry their own emergency backpacks with some personal items.
"I hope that you all stay safe, and I hope that we stay safe," she tells viewers, signing off.
Israel began bombarding Gaza after Hamas, which controls the strip, carried out a surprising attack on Saturday in Israel. It is accused by Israel of killing hundreds of civilians, including children. The Palestinian group denies deliberately targeting civilians but has admitted taking hostages.
In retaliation, Israel   6,000 bombs on Gaza in six days, imposed a total blockade – cutting supplies of food, fuel, and water, and promised to launch a ground invasion aimed at crushing Hamas.
But some world leaders and many international rights and aid groups have condemned Israel's response as brutal and warned it endangers the more than two million people who live in Gaza, about half of whom are children.

Debate over US stance on Israel-Gaza war mounts

The "US is not telling Israel what to do," Vice President Kamala Harris has stated, as debate over Washington's stance on the war in Gaza mounts.
Speaking in an interview  with CBS on Sunday, Harris stressed that the United States is only providing advice, equipment and diplomatic support to Israel. US troops will not be sent to Israel or Gaza, she added.
US policy regarding the conflict has come under increased focus after Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country's war with Hamas has entered its 'second stage'.
"A terrorist organisation, Hamas, slaughtered hundreds of young people at a concert … Israel, without any question, has a right to defend itself," Harris told CBS reporter Bill Whitaker.
"That being said, it is very important that there be no conflation between Hamas and the Palestinians. The Palestinians deserve equal measures of safety and security, self-determination and dignity, and we have been very clear that the rules of war must be adhered to and that there be humanitarian aid that flows," she said.
Asked whether the war could drag US troops in to fight, Harris said: "We have absolutely no intention nor do we have any plans to send combat troops into Israel or Gaza, period."
Tit-for-tat
Harris also noted that while the US wants to ensure the conflict does not escalate, it has not been easy.
Her comments came after the   linked to Iran last week, following a series of attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria.
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the strikes in Syria are not connected to the Israel-Hamas war, despite claims that the tit-for-tat attacks came due to Washington's stance on the Israel-Gaza war.
US President Joe Biden has also told reporters that Washington's response has "nothing to do" with Israel.
Yet Harris also noted to Whitaker that President Biden has warned Iran not to create a wider conflict.
Diplomatic dissent
Vice President Harris's comments are in line with the White House stance. But within Washington's diplomatic corridors there are signs of friction.
Democrats seeking a ceasefire are frustrated over Biden's continuing steadfast support for Israel amid its blockade and bombardment of Gaza.
US diplomats are reported  to be preparing a "dissent cable". The document, criticising Washington's policy, will go to State Department leaders.
"There's basically a mutiny brewing within State at all levels," one State Department official told the Huffington Post.
Last week, State Department official Josh Paul resigned, citing the Biden administration's stance on the Israel-Hamas war as a reason.
'Hamas' attack on Israel was not just a monstrosity; it was a monstrosity of monstrosities … But I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response and for the status quo of the occupation, will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people - and is not in the long term American interest," Paul wrote  in a Linkedin Post.

'Dehumanising'
An October 24 unclassified diplomatic cable reported  on by VICE News, reveals that the US Office of Palestinians Affairs in Jerusalem had warned the White House of the dire situation facing Palestinians in Gaza and called on Washington to take action.
However, two days later, President Biden   over the number of people dead in Gaza, saying that he has 'no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using'.
That helped stir further dissent regarding the US's humanitarian response.
Yara Asi, a Palestinian American public health expert at the University of Central Florida, called the president's remarks 'appalling'.
'To dispute those figures was really, really just putting both feet in with Israel on this, in yet another way that dehumanises Palestinians,' Asi told Al Jazeera.
US Senator Brian Schatz said that he was 'deeply concerned' following a near-total communications blackout on Friday.
"There already is a dire humanitarian situation, including dangerous proximity to military operations for civilians and insufficient amounts of food, water, medicine, and fuel," he said on X.
Signs of response
There are signs that Biden's administration may be beginning to respond to the criticism.
According to a Washington Post report , Washington pressured the Israeli government to switch communication channels back on.
On Sunday, the White House said that Biden called for 'accelerating' humanitarian assistance to Gaza in phone calls with the leaders of Israel and Egypt.
The US leader reiterated to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "Israel has every right to defend its citizens from terrorism and a responsibility to do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law which prioritises the protection of civilians."
In his conversation with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, Biden agreed to commit "to work together" in protecting civilian lives and "ensure" that Palestinians in Gaza are not displaced to Egypt or any other nation, the White House said.
Humanitarian aid has trickled into Gaza through the Rafah crossing run by Egypt, the only crossing not controlled by Israel.
However, the UN and other agencies have warned that the current flow of aid to the 2.3 million people in Gaza, is still a "drop in the ocean".

EU leaders to meet as bloc struggles for united message on Israel-Hamas war

October 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
European Union leaders are set to meet to decide on a united message on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war after days of mixed messages.
In the emergency video conference on Tuesday, the EU leaders will discuss their response to the conflict after confusing and sometimes contradictory messaging that has raised tensions within the bloc.
"It is of utmost importance that the European Council … sets our common position and establishes a clear unified course of action that reflects the complexity of the unfolding situation," European Council President Charles Michel said in a letter inviting leaders to attend the meeting.
Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, travelled to Israel on Friday to tell Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel has Europe's backing, a move that generated blowback for appearing to speak for the bloc as a whole.
'Foreign affairs is a matter for member states, it is a matter for the [European] Council,' the AFP news agency quoted an unnamed EU official as saying.
Von der Leyen also faced criticism for not stating that the EU expects Israel to abide by international humanitarian law in its response to Hamas's October 7 attacks, as other EU leaders did.
EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell last week said Israel's siege of Gaza 'is against international law', following a meeting of EU foreign ministers.
Oliver Varhelyi, the commissioner responsible for relations with countries neighbouring the EU, also faced criticism last week for going it alone to announce that a disbursement of EU development aid to Palestinians had been frozen.
Officials later clarified that development projects in Palestinian territories might 'need to be adjusted' but humanitarian aid would be unaffected.
Von der Leyen on Monday said the EU would triple humanitarian aid  to Palestinians to 75 million euros ($79m).
Palestinians in Gaza are in need of humanitarian aid.
They cannot pay the price of Hamas' barbarism.
On top of tripling humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza, we are organising an EU Humanitarian Air Bridge to Gaza through Egypt.
With the first two flights this week.
- Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) October 16, 2023
During their meeting on Tuesday, EU leaders are expected to discuss ways to mitigate the fallout of the war amid fears of regional escalation and a humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.
Israel has placed Gaza under a total blockade and bombarded it with unprecedented air raids in retaliation for Hamas's attack, the deadliest on Israel in decades.
Israel's attacks have killed at least 2,808 people and injured more than 10,000 others in the enclave, according to Palestinian officials.

Qatar says it successfully mediated an agreement between Israel and officials in the Gaza Strip to reopen crossing points to the besieged territory after Palestinians were prevented from working and violence broke out.
The crossings were opened on Thursday after nearly two weeks of demonstrations by Palestinian workers through an informal agreement Qatar helped mediate alongside a flurry of diplomacy involving Egypt, Israel and Hamas.
'The situation in the Gaza Strip is dire and another conflict will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. Qatar has worked and succeeded in de-escalating the situation in the Gaza Strip by mediating an understanding to reopen the Erez crossing for Palestinian workers,' Qatar's envoy to Gaza, Mohammad al-Emadi, was quoted by media as saying.
'Qatar will spare no efforts in supporting the Palestinian people through diplomacy and developmental initiatives until they achieve their aspirations for statehood and prosperity,' he added.
Israel shut the Beit Hanoun crossing – called 'Erez' by Israel – with Gaza in advance of the Rosh Hashanah Jewish holiday.
For nearly two weeks,   against the protesting labourers, responding with live fire that killed at least one man and wounded dozens more.
'Nightmare'
The reopening allows thousands of Palestinian workers to return to their jobs in Israel and the occupied West Bank.
About 18,000 Gazans have permits from Israeli authorities to work outside the blockaded enclave, providing an injection of cash amounting to some $2m a day to the impoverished territory's economy.
Jobs in Israel are in high demand, paying up to 10 times as much as similar jobs in Gaza. Unemployment in the Palestinian territory – which has been under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade since 2007 – hovers at 50 percent.
"We want to go to work and earn a living for our children because the situation was too bad for us the past two weeks," said Khaled Zurub, 57, who works in construction in Israel.
The crossing closure was a "nightmare", said Mohammad al-Kahlout, a labourer waiting to cross into Israel on Thursday. "It felt like someone was trying to suffocate you."
Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry agency that coordinates with the Palestinians, said security assessments will determine whether the Gaza crossing point will remain open.
After the Erez crossing reopened, Palestinian protest organisers announced they would suspend the daily rallies, but promised to resume demonstrations if Israel did not adhere to its commitments.

The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah armed group has met top Palestinian armed group leaders from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, discussing what their alliance must do to achieve an 'all-out victory' over Israel, according to a statement by Hezbollah.
The statement said Wednesday's meeting involved Hezbollah's Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Hamas deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri and Islamic Jihad chief Ziad al-Nakhala, without mentioning the location.
'The leaders tackled latest developments since the start of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood and the events that followed on all fronts, including the confrontations across the border between Lebanon and the occupied Palestine,' Lebanese state media Al-Manar quoted the statement as saying, referring to the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas fighters that killed at least 1,400 people in Israel and prompted a retaliation that in turn killed more than 5,700 people in Gaza.
'Sayyed Nasrallah assessed with Nakhale and al-Arouri the international and regional stances as well as steps to be taken by the Axis of Resistance in this critical phase in order to achieve an all-out victory and to stop the brutal attack on the oppressed people of Gaza and the West Bank," the statement added.
Since the October 7 attack, Hezbollah has had near-daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces along the Israeli-Lebanese border.
The Lebanese group announced on Wednesday that two more of its fighters had been killed, increasing the death toll in its ranks to 40 fighters since the start of the conflict.

On Tuesday, the health ministry said that 704 Palestinians, including 305 children, were killed as Israel ramps up its aggression against the enclave.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Tuesday's death toll was the highest figure reported in a single day since the conflict began.
In the occupied West Bank, at least 100 people have also been killed in clashes with the Israeli military, the Palestinian health ministry said.
Amid fears that the conflict could spill over across the Middle East, Israel's military said its jets also hit Syrian army infrastructure in response to rockets launched from the neighbouring country.
While the military did not provide further details, it did not accuse Syria's army of firing the two rockets.
Syrian state news agency (SANA) said, citing a military source, that the Israeli attack killed eight soldiers and wounded seven near the southwestern city of Deraa.

US 'urges delay' in ground invasion as Israel continues to pound Gaza

The United States is pressing Israel to delay its anticipated ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, according to reports. Meanwhile, hundreds are reported killed as Israel continues to pound the Palestinian enclave and small ground-force clashes are also reported.
President Joe Biden's administration has advised Israel to delay its invasion plan to allow time for the release of hostages and shipments of aid into Gaza, according to US officials quoted by The New York Times newspaper on Monday.
The report, which also suggests that Washington is concerned about preparing for attacks on US interests in the region, remains unconfirmed.
Meanwhile, Israeli air attacks on Gaza have intensified. Some 400 Palestinians have been killed in the last 24 hours, according to Palestinian health officials.
The Hamas-controlled government media office in the blockaded Gaza Strip said in a statement that more than 60 people were killed in the Israeli raids overnight.
At least 10 other people were killed in further attacks on Monday morning, the media office said in a separate statement, bringing the overall death toll since Sunday night to at least 70.
The Israeli military said on Monday morning it had hit "over 320 military targets in the Gaza Strip" over the past 24 hours.
"The terror targets struck included tunnels containing Hamas terrorists, dozens of operational command centres … and Islamic Jihad terrorists, military compounds, and observation posts," it said in a statement.
Ground forces clash
Hamas fighters engaged with Israeli forces who infiltrated the Gaza Strip on Sunday, according to the Palestinian group's armed wing Qassam Brigades.
The group said the infiltration took place east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza region.
'Fighters engaged with the infiltrating force, destroying two bulldozers and a tank and forced the force to withdraw, before they returned safely to base,' the statement said.
The Israeli army also said one of its soldiers was killed and three injured during the clash on Sunday, adding that the aim was to locate captives held by Hamas.
On Monday, in a televised briefing describing Israel's latest moves on the ground, its chief military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said 222 people had been confirmed as taken captive on October 7 by Hamas.

"During the night, there were raids by tank and infantry forces. These are raids that kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for the next stage in the war," Hagari said, describing incursions that went "deep" into Gaza.
"These raids also locate and search for anything we can get in terms of intelligence on the missing and the hostages."
Hagari said such interventions helped understand where "the terrorists are assembling, [and how] the terrorists are getting organised in anticipation of the next stages of the war. And our role is to reduce these threats".
Delay
The unconfirmed New York Times report said the Biden administration wants to buy time for negotiations with Hamas on the release of the captives and to allow more humanitarian aid to reach Gaza.
It added that American officials also wanted more time to prepare for possible attacks on US interests in the region from Iran-backed groups, which officials said are likely to intensify once Israel moves its forces fully into Gaza.
For more than two weeks, Israel has been attacking Gaza.
The violence has killed at least 1,400 people in Israel and more than 4,650 people in Gaza.
Amid the campaign, tens of thousands of Israeli troops are gathered along the enclave's borders for a widely anticipated ground invasion.
Israel has told more than one million residents in northern Gaza to move south for their safety, and the United Nations says more than half of the territory's 2.3-million population is now displaced.
Hundreds of thousands of civilians are believed to remain in and around Gaza City in the north, unwilling or unable to leave.

China takes cautious approach to diplomacy over Israel-Gaza war

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A Chinese embassy spokesperson in July expressed confidence that Beijing was ready to play a positive role in promoting peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, amid hopes the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia would spur a 'wave of reconciliation' across the Middle East.
The previous month, Chinese President Xi Jinping welcomed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to Beijing and invited Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu to visit.
China's role in the dtente between Iran and Saudi Arabia garnered much attention with some marking it as a defining moment, a demonstration that as the United States's star was waning in the region, China's was rising.
Then, on October 7, the armed group Hamas launched a surprise assault on Israel, killing at least 1,400 people and abducting more than 200. Israel has responded with a relentless bombardment of the blockaded Gaza and recently launched ground attacks into the coastal strip, which is controlled by Hamas.
According to Gaza's health ministry, at least 9,770 Palestinians have been killed so far.
US President Joe Biden quickly condemned Hamas's attack while his administration later ordered two carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean and readied the deployment of 2,000 troops to deter any other actors from widening the war in the region.
Biden also   in a show of solidarity. A meeting was scheduled between Biden and several Arab leaders, but it was cancelled following a blast at the   in Gaza in which hundreds were killed.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron have also visited Israel, while Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa travelled to Israel and Jordan.
At the same time, Egypt and Qatar have reportedly been playing a key role in negotiating the release of the  .
China's engagement, however, has looked quite different.
Beijing has sent its Middle East envoy,  , but neither Xi nor his foreign minister, Wang Yi, have visited the region since the outbreak of fighting.
Xi has called for a ceasefire while Wang has said that the source of the conflict 'lies in the fact that justice has not been done to the Palestinian people' and that the 'collective punishment' of the Palestinians must come to an end.
Such statements follow the basic Chinese playbook when conflict breaks out between Israelis and Palestinians, according to William Figueroa, an assistant professor at the University of Groningen who has conducted research on China's relationship with Middle Eastern countries.
'They take a very cautious stance initially and then call for peace and condemn violence against civilians while primarily focusing on Palestinian grievances,' he told Al Jazeera.
Yao-Yuan Yeh is a professor of international studies focusing on Taiwan, China and Japan at the US University of St Thomas. He agrees that in spite of an increased Chinese diplomatic engagement in the Middle East recently, this has not translated into a leading mediation role in the current Hamas-Israel war.
'We have not really seen the Chinese doing something new or taking a leadership position in the current conflict.'
Israel-Palestine in Beijing's Middle East strategy
In the immediate aftermath of Hamas's attack on Israel, the Chinese government was accused of responding in only vague terms and adopting a non-committal tone.
'They took kind of a wait-and-see attitude at first,' said Figueroa.
The Chinese foreign ministry called for calm, to exercise of restraint and refrained from condemning Hamas.
Beijing has traditionally   relations with the Palestinians in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
During Mao Zedong's era, Beijing considered the Palestinian struggle for land to be part of the world's national liberation movement, according to Hongda Fan, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University.
'The understanding of the Palestinian Question still largely stems from this perception,' Fan told Al Jazeera.
In 1965, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) was allowed to open a diplomatic mission in China, and upgraded to an embassy in 1974. Beijing was probably the PLO's primary supplier of weapons for a time in the 1960s and 1970s, according to the Beirut-based Institute for Palestine Studies, and has recognised the State of Palestine since 1988.
However, China has also expanded its ties with Israel.
China established full diplomatic relations with Israel in 1992 and has since invested billions in its economy - its investments in the Palestinian territories being negligible in comparison.
But Chinese investments in Israel are in turn dwarfed by its  .
'China has invested heavily in Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries,' Figueroa said.
Beijing and Riyadh announced investment deals worth $10bn in June.
Trade between the two reached $106bn in 2022 – almost double the value of Saudi Arabian-US trade.
China is also the primary buyer of Saudi Arabian and Iranian oil.
This is part of a larger development which has seen China become the Arab world's main trading partner.
According to Figueroa, China's deep economic ties with the Gulf states have contributed to a Chinese Middle East outlook centred around certain Middle Eastern countries like  .
So when it became clear there was going to be a strong outcry from these countries following the Israeli military operations in Gaza, the Chinese rhetoric became much more clearly pro-Palestinian, Figueroa observed.
Subsequently, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang accused Israel of going 'beyond self-defence' in its military actions in Gaza.
Opposing the US
This has placed the Chinese government at odds with the US.
While there has been an absence of Chinese diplomatic leadership in the conflict, according to analysts, China has been more outspoken in its criticism of Washington even as the two countries try to rebuild a severely strained relationship.

In an editorial in the government-controlled China Daily, the newspaper accused the US of 'adding fuel to the fire by blindly backing Israel in the ongoing conflict'. The state-run Global Times said in its own editorial that the US was 'stained with the blood of innocent civilians' after the US on October 18   a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by Brazil, calling for a humanitarian pause to the conflict to allow aid into Gaza.
On October 27, a resolution put before the UN General Assembly drafted by Jordan received support from 120 countries. The US voted against it while China voted in favour.
Before that, China, along with Russia, vetoed a US draft resolution that stated Israel's right to defend itself and demanded that Iran stop exporting arms to hardline groups.
'The draft does not reflect the world's strongest calls for a  , an end to the fighting, and it does not help resolve the issue,' China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun told the council after the vote.
Beijing is this month's Security Council president and has said the Israel-Gaza war will be a priority.
Laying out China's plans for November, Zhang said the council's performance was 'not as good as what the global community expects', and that every effort would be made to guide it towards concrete actions in promoting political settlements.
'To make it more specific, the top priority [this month] is to tackle the Israel-Palestine - namely Gaza - conflict that is going on,' he said.
On Monday, at the request of China and the United Arab Emirates, the 15-member body will hold more closed-door deliberations on the conflict.
'The best-case scenario for China would be for the fighting to end as soon as possible and for China to be involved in any potential negotiating process in some way,' Figueroa said.
'But I am not sure they will be able to be involved at all, frankly.'

Israel's war on Gaza: Is the West Bank under increased attack too?

October 19th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Ramallah, occupied West Bank - As the world's attention has been fixed on Israel's brutal bombardment of the Gaza Strip for the past two weeks, killings of nearly 70 Palestinians by Israeli forces in the same period have barely made it to the headlines.
More than   have been killed in Israel's deadliest assault on Gaza, which is under a total blockade.
The occupied West Bank on the other hand has witnessed record killings in the past two years, with an average of one Palestinian killed a day by Israeli forces. At least 69 Palestinians have been killed, including eight by armed settlers, across the West Bank and Jerusalem since October 7, when the latest escalation between Israel and Palestinians began.
Israeli army raids into Palestinian cities and villages have also sharply increased, along with confrontations and protests against the bombing of Gaza, which has killed at least 1,000 children.
Tensions are also growing with the Palestinian Authority (PA), which has limited administrative control over 18 percent of the occupied West Bank and is seen by many as a subcontractor for the Israeli occupation.
What has been happening in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem?
Israel's latest assault on Gaza began after fighters from Hamas, the Palestinian armed resistance movement governing the occupied Strip, launched a surprise attack on October 7 just outside the besieged enclave on Israeli territory. So far, at least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, according to Israeli officials.
Since then, the Israeli army has stepped up its daily deadly raids on Palestinian neighbourhoods, villages and cities in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than three million Palestinians live. Killings of residents by armed settlers have also increased.
These attacks have led to an average of five Palestinians being killed every day in those areas since October 7. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Wednesday that more than 1,300 have been injured so far.
Between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, Israeli forces and settlers killed five Palestinians and injured dozens of others with live ammunition.
Two of the five Palestinians killed were children. The health ministry identified them as 16-year-old Taha Mahameed, who was killed in the Nour Shams refugee camp in Tulkarem, and 17-year-old Ahmad Muneer Sadooq, killed in the Dheisheh refugee camp in Bethlehem.
The ministry noted they were both shot in the head during confrontations with the Israeli army over its continued bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip for the 13th consecutive day.
The other two individuals killed by Israeli army fire were 32-year-old Ibrahim Jibreel Awad, in the village of Budrus west of Ramallah, and 23-year-old Ibrahim Haj Ali in the village of Jammain outside of Nablus city.
Separately, Israeli settlers shot dead 21-year-old Mohammad Fawaqa in the area of Dura al-Qar' about 10 minutes north of Ramallah.
Mass arrests
Israeli forces have also arrested at least 850 Palestinians in raids in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem over the past 13 days, including at least 120 overnight on Wednesday. This is apart from hundreds of other Palestinians, including labourers, from Gaza who have been arrested inside Israel.
The escalating violence has sparked sporadic and organised protests and confrontations against both the Palestinian Authority (PA) in West Bank city centres and Israeli forces at checkpoints, military bases and settlements.
The protests increased drastically after the bombing of a hospital courtyard in Gaza on Tuesday night killing 471 people, in what has been described as a massacre and spurred worldwide outrage. Palestinians blamed Israel for the hospital bombing while Israel pointed fingers of blame at armed groups.
Images and videos aired by journalists at the scene showed countless bodies strewn across the ground and people carrying the limbs of their slain loved ones in bags, on the 12th day of Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza.
Some 70 percent of those killed were women and children, the health ministry said on Wednesday, and at least 314 others remain injured, including 22 in critical condition.
What has the PA's response been?
On the night of the hospital attack, thousands emerged in protests across occupied West Bank cities, which the PA cracked down on with live ammunition, teargas and stun grenades.
A young Palestinian girl, 12-year-old Razan Nasrallah,   by the PA security forces in the northern city of Jenin, and dozens of others were injured, including at least one in critical condition.
In Ramallah, where the PA is based, protesters hurled rocks, chairs and other items at PA armoured vehicles attempting to disperse them.
The most common chant in protests has been: 'Put the sword before the sword, we are the men of Mohammed Deif,' in reference to the commander of Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, but protests on Tuesday also   a call for PA President Mahmoud Abbas to step down.
The PA was created under the   between the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Israel, making it 30 years old this year.
It was formed as an interim, five-year governing body, meant to lead to a Palestinian state comprising of the 1967-occupied territories of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Israel's 56-year military occupation of these territories, including the building of illegal settlements – the majority of which were built either entirely or partially on private Palestinian land – has prevented that prospect.
Under the agreement, the PA is also required to share intelligence with Israel as part of its highly controversial   and to aid in thwarting armed resistance by Palestinians, including by helping with arrests, making it unpopular with most Palestinians.

Palestinians break into Gaza UN aid warehouses in a sign of desperation

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) says thousands of Palestinians, desperate due to three weeks of total siege and bombing, broke into several of its warehouses in the Gaza Strip, taking wheat, flour and other basic goods.
"This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege," said Thomas White, the UNRWA chief in Gaza.
Israel imposed a total siege – no food, water, electricity – on the Palestinian enclave of 2.3 million people in the wake of the Hamas attack in Israel. Israel has allowed limited supplies of basic necessities and medicines. Efforts are under way to get more supply of food, water, fuel and medicine in the enclave that has been under intense bombing since October 7.
UNRWA provides necessities in Gaza, and many of the displaced Palestinians are sheltering in UNRWA schools. Several hospitals have shut down and others are on the verge of closing down due to a lack of fuel.
According to the UNRWA, more than 613,000 of 1.4 million internally displaced people in Gaza are sheltering in 150 of its facilities across the blockaded territory.
But severe overcrowding, a lack of privacy and inadequate sanitation have put these schools at risk of a prolonged and severe public health crisis, adding pressure to the already overloaded healthcare system which doctors and the Ministry of Health describe as being in a state of total collapse.
The UN agency said some shelters are currently hosting 10 to 12 times more people than their capacity.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire" in the Israel-Gaza war.
Speaking in Beijing just hours after the   in Gaza, Guterres said that Hamas "attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people".
Speaking at a forum to mark 10 years of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the UN chief reiterated what he called "two urgent humanitarian appeals".
He called on Hamas to "[immediately] and [unconditionally] release" those it is holding captive and Israel "to immediately allow unrestricted access of humanitarian aid" to Gaza. The humanitarian ceasefire was needed for both of these appeals to be met, Guterres added.
"Too many lives and the fate of the entire region hang in the balance," he said.
Guterres's speech came after he released a statement condemning the attack on a   in Gaza, in some of the strongest language he has yet used to describe the violence over the past week.
Palestinian health authorities say at least 500 people were killed in the attack, which has been widely   and human rights groups. Israel has denied responsibility.
Representatives from more than 130 mostly developing countries are attending the forum in China, including at least 20 heads of state and government.
Speaking on the theme of the conference, China's growing programme of providing finance and loans to developing countries to build infrastructure, Guterres acknowledged that many developing countries were "drowning in debt" and called for "effective debt relief mechanisms".
  also addressed the opening ceremony of the forum in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Israel foreign minister says US will allow visa-free travel for Israelis

September 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC – The administration of US President Joe Biden is set to allow Israeli citizens to travel visa-free to the United States, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen has said, despite concerns about Israel's treatment of Palestinian- and Arab-American travellers.
In a social media post on Monday, Cohen said Israel's looming acceptance into the   (VWP) was "great news" for the country.
Cohen said that, "as we promised", Israel would enter the programme in November.
The United States government has not formally announced Israel will be joining the VWP, but State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday that a decision would be made in the next days.
That was echoed by a spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), who told Al Jazeera in an email on Monday afternoon: "We have nothing to announce publicly at this time, but DHS and the State Department will make a final determination in the coming days."
The prospect of Israel's entry into the VWP has faced widespread condemnation from Arab-American civil rights advocates.
That's because one of the main elements of the programme is what's known as "reciprocity"; countries in the VWP must allow visa-free travel for American citizens in exchange for a similar easing of visa requirements for their own nationals travelling to the US.
However, scores of US and other foreign nationals of Palestinian and Arab descent are routinely turned away by Israeli authorities, who control all access to the occupied Palestinian territories.
In 2019, Israel   US Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib to visit the country and the occupied Palestinian territories, citing 'their boycott activities against Israel'.
While US officials have pledged that in order to be accepted into the VWP, Israel would have to treat Americans equally – stressing that "blue is blue" in reference to the colour of the US passport – rights advocates have cast doubt on whether Israel would live up  .
In July, US and Israeli officials signed a   to facilitate Israel's entry into the programme. That set off a trial period before the Biden administration makes a final determination by the end of the month.
However, even if fully implemented as intended, experts have said Israel's admission into the programme could still possibly violate the US Constitution, which requires equal treatment under the law.
For instance, the memorandum, a copy of which was shared with Al Jazeera, acknowledges Israel's right to deny admission to Americans based on 'legitimate security concerns', a caveat that advocates say Israel may easily abuse to target Palestinian rights supporters.
Moreover, it remains unclear whether US citizens in Gaza would be able to leave the besieged territory under the new regulations.
"If confirmed, this decision is horrible," Abed Ayoub, executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) advocacy group, told Al Jazeera in a statement on Monday.
"By allowing for the creation and recognition of different classes of US citizens, our government has endorsed and embraced Israeli discrimination and apartheid. With this decision, the US government will be sending a message that not all American passport holders are equal."

Israeli forces have attacked Palestinian worshippers at Bab as-Silsila, one of the main entrances to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem, according to local sources.
Israeli forces imposed tight security measures on Sunday, ejecting worshippers from Al-Aqsa Mosque and intensifying their presence around it, denying access to any Palestinian below the age of 50 to clear the way for Israeli settlers on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.
In celebration of Rosh Hashanah, hundreds of ultranationalist Israelis made an incursion into the Al-Aqsa courtyard through the Morocco Gate under the protection of Israeli troops, according to news outlet Al-Mayadeen.

The Jerusalem Islamic Endowments Department confirmed that the army was working to clear the compound prior to the settler incursion.
Israeli settler groups had been calling for unfettered access to the compound to celebrate Rosh Hashanah on what is known to Jews as the Temple Mount.
A number of Muslim worshippers had gathered at the holy site following dawn prayers to object to the harassment and intrusions by Israeli settlers.

Israeli forces "physically assaulted and beat up three worshippers", including an elderly man and elderly woman, near Bab as-Silsila, Palestinian news agency WAFA said, adding that the three had objected to an Israeli settler blowing a horn at the entrance to Al-Aqsa Mosque.
Two men were arrested inside the compound and transferred to 'an unknown destination', Al-Maydeen added.
Video footage showing settlers touring the Al-Aqsa Mosque courtyard was circulating on social media.

A coalition of 34 Harvard University student organisations has issued a pro-Palestinian statement  in reaction to  , prompting outrage from the university's prominent alumni.
The students of the most influential university in United States politics said in the statement published on Monday that they "hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence" between the Palestinians and Israelis following decades of occupation, adding that "the apartheid regime is the only one to blame".
Harvard has produced eight former presidents and four of the nine current Supreme Court justices.
The organisations signing the letter included Muslim and Palestinian support groups as well as others named for a variety of backgrounds including the Harvard Jews for Liberation and the African American Resistance Organization.
Prominent Harvard University alumni on Monday denounced the pro-Palestinian statement and urged the university to take action against the signatories.
Harvard President Lawrence Summers, the former US Treasury secretary under Democratic President Bill Clinton and former university president, was one of several Harvard graduates to criticise the current Harvard leadership for failing to respond.
"The silence from Harvard's leadership … has allowed Harvard to appear at best neutral towards acts of terror against the Jewish state of Israel," Summers wrote on the social media platform X. "I am sickened."
Elise Stefanik, a Republican US Representative from New York and a Harvard graduate, called the statement "abhorrent and heinous" for excusing the "slaughter of innocent women and children".
Republican US Senator Ted Cruz, a Harvard Law School graduate, wrote on X: "What the hell is wrong with Harvard?"
Harvard President Claudine Gay and senior leadership including 15 deans issued a statement  on Monday that said they were "heartbroken by the death and destruction unleashed by the attack by Hamas that targeted citizens in Israel this weekend".
But the statement avoided direct references to the student letter or the reaction to it.

A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel was not affiliated with the ship's ownership, operation or crew. However, public ownership records link the vessel to Israeli businessman Abraham 'Rami' Ungar. Japan's government has condemned the seizure of the ship, which was on its way from Turkey to India.
The Washington Post reported on Sunday that the United States, Hamas and Israel had reached a tentative deal that entails freeing 50 or more captives in Gaza every day over a five-day pause in fighting, but the US and Israel both said there was no deal in place yet. Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani   that only "minor" challenges that are "more logistical" remain.
In a statement  on Sunday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was "deeply shocked that two UNRWA schools were struck in less than 24 hours in Gaza". He called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and thanked Qatar for leading mediation efforts.
Human Impact and Fighting

'Preparations are under way' for them to enter Egypt along with three doctors and two nurses, according to Mohammed Zaqout, director-general of hospitals in Gaza. Eight other premature babies at al-Shifa have died after incubators stopped functioning following Israel's ban on the entry of fuel into the enclave early in the war.
Two Israeli soldiers have been killed during fighting in northern Gaza, raising the count of its personnel killed since October 7 to 387, the Israeli army announced on Monday.
On Sunday, 69,000 litres of fuel entered Gaza from Egypt, according to the latest flash update from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Doctors Without Borders reported on Sunday that 122 patients arrived at the   in Khan Younis within minutes of an Israeli attack in the vicinity. Seventy were dead upon arrival, while others had burns and injuries.
Diplomacy
French President Emmanuel Macron   Netanyahu on Sunday that there were 'too many civilian losses' in Israel's war in Gaza and reminded him of 'the importance of achieving an immediate humanitarian truce leading to a ceasefire', according to a statement from Macron's office on Sunday. The country will also be sending more medical supplies and a second hospital ship to Gaza.
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on Muslim states to cut political ties with Israel, at least for 'a limited time' on Sunday, reported the Reuters news agency, quoting state media.
China's Foreign Minister   told a visiting delegation of Arab and Muslim officials on Monday that Beijing would work with them to "restore peace in the Middle East as soon as possible", according to the AFP news agency. He added that Beijing has "always firmly supported the   of the Palestinian people to restore their legitimate national rights and interests", while the delegation called for an immediate ceasefire, according to Reuters.
US President Joe Biden said "a revitalised Palestinian Authority" should eventually govern the West Bank in an op-ed published in The Washington Post on Saturday.
Arrests and attacks in the occupied West Bank
Israeli forces have arrested at least 30 Palestinian workers who were originally from Gaza during raids in Deir al-Ghusun and the neighbouring town of Attil, in the northwest part of the  , according to Palestinian news agency Wafa on Monday.

The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees has said that it will be forced to suspend aid work in the Gaza Strip within 48 hours, as an Israeli siege   to much-needed fuel.
In a social media post on Monday, Thomas White, the Gaza chief for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), said that fuel has not been allowed into Gaza for more than a month, as humanitarian conditions reach  .
"The humanitarian operation in Gaza will grind to a halt in the next 48 hours as no fuel is allowed to enter Gaza," White wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
As Israel continues to hammer Gaza with air strikes amid a ground offensive on the territory, a siege   to food, electricity, and fuel has overwhelmed organisations trying to assist those displaced and wounded by the fighting.
Palestinian authorities have said that Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 11,240 people, including more than 4,600 children, since fighting began on October 7 when the Palestinian armed group Hamas carried out an attack on southern Israel that killed about  , according to Israeli authorities.
The UN said on Monday that 101 workers in Gaza have been killed since the beginning of the fighting.
In Gaza, where the health system is being stretched to the breaking point, the collapse of medical and communications services has stymied   since November 10.
Palestinian doctors   that hospitals are running out of fuel, leaving them unable to save patients, including newborn children in incubators, as electricity generators stop working.
Israeli forces have closed in around   in northern Gaza, with medical workers and at least 650 patients trapped inside. Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said that 32 patients died in the last three days due to a shortage of power.
Israel says the hospital sits atop a complex of   used by Hamas, an accusation the group denies.
"The tanks are in front of the hospital. We are under full blockade. It's a totally civilian area. Only hospital facility, hospital patients, doctors and other civilians stay in the hospital. Someone should stop this," Dr Ahmed El Mokhallalati, a surgeon, told the news outlet Reuters.
He added that Israel had bombed water tanks, water wells, and water pumps for the hospital and that those remaining were 'barely surviving'.
Officials have also warned that the conditions created by the bombing and the siege could lead to the  , with access to clean water severely restricted.
"This morning two of our main water distribution contractors ceased working – they simply ran out of fuel – which will deny 200,000 people potable water," White said.
Mansour Shouman, a displaced Palestinian who fled northern Gaza and sought refuge at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, told Al Jazeera that the conditions at the site were "primitive".
"Let's leave aside the food and the water, electricity, fuel. There is no safety, there is no security," he said. "We were told, 'Go to the south, you'll be safe there.' However, every day I'm hearing more ambulances come to the hospital. I'm seeing more people take their loved ones to the graveyard."

UK minister Suella Braverman fired: Here's what to know

November 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has sacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman after mounting pressure on him to act against her.
Here's everything to know about Braverman and why she was sacked on Monday:
Why was she fired?
The government said Braverman left her job as part of a cabinet reshuffle ahead of a general election expected next year.
But the dismissal came after Braverman   from within the Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party. After pro-Palestinian   in London, she wrote an opinion piece for The Times of London, which was published on Thursday. In it, she blamed the police for 'playing favourites' and for taking a lenient stance towards pro-Palestinian protests.
She described the protesters as 'pro-Palestinian mobs' and 'hate marchers'.
Sunak told reporters that Braverman had not run the article by his office, violating the ministerial code. Still, while Sunak was   to sack Braverman, he had initially backed her.
Who is Suella Braverman?
Braverman was appointed as Britain's secretary of state in the Home Department by former Prime Minister Liz Truss in September 2022. She was ordered to   weeks into the job for what she said was breaking rules by sending an official document from her personal email account. She was reinstated as head of the Home Department by Sunak after he became prime minister.
A daughter of immigrants from Kenya and Mauritius, she grew up in Wembley. Braverman, a Conservative, was appointed as attorney general by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2020 and has also been a Brexit minister, a post from which she resigned in November 2018.
She has championed tougher immigration rules, such as a plan to   — blocking the entry of refugees crossing the English Channel.
Who is the new home secretary?
In the reshuffle triggered by Braverman being fired, Sunak appointed James Cleverly as the new home secretary.
Until then, Cleverly had been serving as the foreign secretary. To replace him, former Prime Minster David Cameron was appointed. Cameron   as prime minister in July 2016 after his bid to keep Britain in the European Union failed. Three months later, he   in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the EU.
What's the UK position in the Israel-Gaza war?
Sunak   Israel on October 19 to 'express solidarity with the Israeli people'.
'I am proud to stand here with you in Israel's darkest hour,' Sunak said at a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'We will stand with you in solidarity. We will stand with you and your people. And we also want you to win.'
How have people reacted?
After her dismissal, Braverman said: 'It has been the greatest privilege of my life to serve as home secretary.'
'I will have more to say in due course,' she added.
Braverman's removal and Cameron's return angered some Conservatives on the right of the party.
Member of Parliament and former Business and Trade Secretary Jacob William Rees-Mogg told GB News that sacking Braverman was a mistake that undermines Conservatives' chances to win the next election. He added that Cameron's appointment could shift the Conservative vote to Reform UK, the new Brexit party.
Cameron's appointment has also been criticised by the opposition. David Lammy of the Labour Party posted on X, formerly Twitter, that Cameron's appointment was 'a last gasp act of desperation'.
David Cameron was a disastrous PM. This is a last gasp act of desperation from a government devoid of talent and ideas.
Amid international crisis, Sunak has chosen an unelected failure from the past who MPs cannot even hold to account.
Only Labour offers the change we need.

Dozens injured as Israeli forces raid Nablus, blow up building

August 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Nablus, occupied West Bank – A large contingent of Israeli soldiers accompanied by a military bulldozer raided the Balata refugee camp, forced families to evacuate a residential building and then blew it up at about 3am on Wednesday.
The incident overnight was among several raids by Israeli forces in the city of Nablus in the occupied West Bank.
The raids left one Palestinian man seriously injured and destroyed the Fatah party's offices in Balata, in addition to the apartment building owned by Raed Shallal, the Palestinian Red Crescent and officials said.
'We were forcibly evicted, and we could not take anything out of the house, even ID cards and school bags,' Shallal, a 40-year-old father of seven, said. 'We are now homeless, my wife and our children, the oldest is 12 and the youngest, a year and a half old.'
Also in Shallal's destroyed building was the family home of a Palestinian man wanted by Israeli forces.
More than 80 Palestinians suffered from tear gas inhalation during the raids, the Red Crescent said.
Earlier, Israeli soldiers fired tear gas canisters at Palestinians in the eastern part of the city where they were providing cover for Israeli settlers who had stormed Joseph's Tomb, a shrine located within an area controlled by the Palestinian Authority.
Israeli settlers frequently storm Nablus to perform prayers at the shrine under the guard of the Israeli army, believing that it is the tomb of the Prophet Joseph, while Palestinians say the tomb is only 200 years old and a Muslim man called Yousef Dweikat lived there.​​​​​​​​​
One man, Mohammed Leila, was shot five times in the chest and twice in the legs near the tomb and was seriously wounded. He was transferred to Rafidia Hospital in Nablus, Ahmed Jibril, the director of the Emergency and Ambulance Center at the Red Crescent, said.

In a separate incident, another Palestinian was shot in his car by the Huwara checkpoint after allegedly firing at soldiers there, but Israeli forces prevented ambulance crews from reaching him and arrested him instead.
'Our medics were attacked and prevented from providing first aid to the injured man in his car,' Jibril told Al Jazeera. 'He was kidnapped by the soldiers and taken to an unknown destination.'
Jibril said medics and first aid teams are often attacked, whether by verbal assault, physical beatings, or being targeted by live and rubber bullets, during Israel's near-daily raids into the occupied West Bank.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, Nablus Governor Ghassan Douglas, a Palestinian official who monitors Israeli settlements in the Nablus region, said these acts by the Israeli army are 'clear evidence of the arrogance of the Israeli occupation'.
'We recorded the damages in the camp in the aftermath of the raid, and we will rebuild everything that was destroyed and return the residents to their homes,' he said.
'This is a message to the Israeli occupation that the Palestinian people remain, despite the siege imposed on them, until the occupation is defeated."
In a statement, the Israeli military said its forces "blew up two laboratories for the production of explosive devices in the camp" and that15 makeshift bombs were found at the site.
The statement also said Israeli forces "neutralised a number of explosives planted on the entrance road to Balata".

But Douglas accused Israel of hiding behind claims of carrying out operations against 'terrorists', and said the Shallal building had housed four families.
Shallal, who had previously spent seven and a half years in Israeli prisons, said this is not the first time a family home has been targeted.
'Two months ago, the house of my brother and my mother was bombed, with the aim of forcing my brother Abdullah to turn himself in,' he said.
His mother Jamila Shallal, 60, said Israeli forces have been trying to arrest Abdullah since last December after they targeted her home with an ENERGA anti-tank grenade.
'The bombing of the two family homes has resulted in 29 members of my family being homeless,' she told Al Jazeera.
'Today, Israel has displaced us again after expelling my family from Jaffa in 1948,' she said, appealing to the Palestinian Authority to provide shelter.
Israel's increased raids into the occupied West Bank have stoked violence, with more than 200 Palestinians killed there this year so far.

November 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Hospitals in northern Gaza are now completely out of service, according to the besieged enclave's Ministry of Health.
Ashraf al-Qudra, Gaza's health ministry spokesperson, said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Tuesday that the occupancy rate in hospitals in Gaza's north has reached 190 percent.
Israel bombed and destroyed parts of al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza, where more than 700 people are still held captive under a siege by the Israeli army, according to al-Qudra.
Last week, Israeli forces   to search for what they said was a Hamas tunnel network and command centre built underneath the complex. Hamas has denied the allegations.
A group of 28   were evacuated from the al-Shifa Hospital to Egypt to receive treatment on Monday, according to the Palestinian authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO).
'Circle of death'
Al-Qudra also said that about 120 people were evacuated from northern Gaza's Indonesian Hospital to Nasser Medical Complex in the south of the Strip.
There are still more than 400 injured people inside the Indonesian Hospital, in addition to about 200 medical staff and more than 2,000 others taking refuge, he added.
The Israeli army has put those inside the hospital in a "circle of death", targeting anybody who moves around the hospital or inside it, al-Qudra said.
Gaza's health ministry had said on Monday that at least 12 Palestinians were   and dozens wounded by attacks on the hospital funded by Jakarta, which is currently   by Israeli tanks.
The WHO said on the same day that the Indonesian Hospital was only able to provide basic services, with the lives of those with severe injuries and other medical emergencies being at immediate risk.
Al-Qudra also said that Israeli air strikes targeted the house of Gaza's deputy undersecretary of the health ministry on Tuesday morning, adding that there were 56 of his relatives in the house who had been displaced from different areas of Gaza.
Rescue teams managed to find 17 bodies while the rest are still under the rubble, according to the spokesperson.

Dire conditions
Hospitals in northern Gaza and Gaza City have faced power outages due to a lack of fuel and Israeli attacks.
They have also faced severe shortages of water, essential medicines and supplies as Israel continues its ground operations and air strikes on the enclave.
The WHO says it has recorded 335 attacks on health complexes in the occupied Palestinian territory since October 7, the beginning of the Gaza war, including 164 attacks in the Gaza Strip and 171 attacks in the West Bank.
These attacks have resulted in forced mass evacuations from hospitals, and multiple fatalities and casualties among patients, their companions, and displaced people taking refuge there, according to the WHO.
At least 13,000 Palestinians – about 5,600 of them children and 3,500 women – have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its air and ground assault on Gaza after the October 7 attacks by Hamas targeting Israel, according to the enclave's health ministry.
Hamas and allied groups took about 240 captives during their incursion into southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.

Israel orders 1.1 million people in Gaza to move south: What to know

October 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel's army has ordered the evacuation of all civilians living in Gaza City and in the north of the Gaza Strip ahead of a feared ground offensive on the besieged enclave.
The directive came on Friday on the heels of what the United Nations said was a warning they received from Israel to evacuate 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza within 24 hours.
The order, which comes on the seventh day of a   and "  " declared by Israel following an unprecedented Hamas incursion and deadly attack, directs residents of Gaza City to flee deeper south into the Gaza Strip, a narrow coastal territory that is home to about 2.3 million people.
What the Israeli army said
Israel's directive charged that Hamas fighters were hiding in tunnels under Gaza City.
'This evacuation is for your own safety,' the Israeli military said, in a warning it said was sent to Gaza City civilians.
'You will be able to return to Gaza City only when another announcement permitting it is made. Do not approach the area of the security fence with the State of Israel,' it added in a statement.
It warned that "in the following days", the Israeli army "will continue to operate significantly in Gaza City and make extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians".
More than 1,500 people – about half of them children and women – have been killed in relentless Israeli bombardment on Gaza since Hamas attacked Israel October 7, in a surprise operation that killed more than 1,300 people in Israel.
What the UN said
The broad order for all of Gaza's north also applies to all UN staff and to the hundreds of thousands of people who have taken shelter in UN schools and other facilities since Israel launched round-the-clock air strikes on Saturday.
'The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences,' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.
'The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation,' the spokesman said.
The global body also said its agency for Palestinian refugees is moving operations and foreign staff to southern Gaza, following the Israel army's evacuation order.
"UNRWA relocated its central operations centre and international staff to the south to continue its humanitarian operations and support to its staff and Palestine Refugees in Gaza," the agency wrote on X.
What is happening on the ground
As the news of the order spread, confusion and fear started spreading among panicked residents of the besieged enclave.
'I have been receiving lots of phone calls from my father, my brother, my friends," al Jazeera's Safwat al-Kahlout, reporting from northern Gaza, said. "'What is the plan, where should we go, is there a specific place in the south where we can go?'' al-Kahlout said, adding that the order was impossible to follow.
Inas Hamdan, an officer at the UN Palestinian refugee agency in Gaza City, echoed the sentiment.
'This is chaos, no one understands what to do,' said Hamdan, as she grabbed whatever she could throw into her bags as the panicked shouts of her relatives could be heard around her.
Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum, also reporting from Gaza, said southern Gaza was not even big enough to host "this massive number of displaced people".
"The space in the Gaza Strip only contains about 365 square kilometres (140 square miles). You're talking about half of the population [who] will move to live in half of the space they used to live in," he said.
What has been the reaction?
In the United States, progressive US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also denounced Israel's push.
'Any person can see that ordering 1+ million people to move in under 24 hours is not possible. It is unacceptable,' she wrote in a social media post.
'The UN has already deemed the order 'impossible' without 'devastating humanitarian consequences'. Humanity is at stake. Nearly half are children. We must halt this.'

Palestinian-American comedian and activist Amer Zahr called Israel's order 'depraved'.
'Israel continues to terrorise Palestinians by basically telling them that its soldiers are about to invade,' Zahr told Al Jazeera.
'It wants to create space for its illegal, murderous invasion by making the most densely populated place on Earth even more crowded, essentially turning the Palestinians there into fish in a barrel. It's depraved,' he added.
Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch, said  'the international community must act to prevent a calamity" caused by the massive displacement.
"History will not be kind to those who remain silent,' he said.

Biden to Netanyahu: Occupying Gaza would be a 'big mistake'

November 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
US President Joe Biden has said he had made it clear to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that occupying Gaza would be "a big mistake" and that the two-state solution was the only way to bring an end to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
"I made it clear to the Israelis I think it's a big mistake for them to think they're going to occupy Gaza and maintain Gaza," Biden told a news conference in San Francisco. "I don't think that works."
Netanyahu said earlier this month that after the war Gaza would have to be 'demilitarised, deradicalised and rebuilt' and that Israel would need to find a '  ' to govern the enclave, which has been run by Hamas since 2006.
The Israeli leader said there was no plan to "occupy" Gaza although many consider it an occupied territory already because Israel has full control of its borders, airspace and territorial waters despite having formally withdrawn its forces and settlers in 2005.
Speaking as the Israeli military continued its raid on  , Biden said he had also discussed with Israeli leaders the need to 'be incredibly careful' in its actions at the hospital, under which Israel says the Palestinian armed group Hamas had built its military headquarters.
Hospital officials and Hamas, which controls Gaza, deny the claim.
More than 11,300 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began bombarding the besieged enclave on October 7 after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 captive.
Biden, who was speaking to the media after a four-hour summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, insisted the only way to end the bloodshed was the 'two-state solution', with Israel and Palestinians living side by side.
While urging caution at al-Shifa, Biden repeated Israeli claims about the military headquarters and said Hamas was committing war crimes by housing such a facility beneath a hospital.
The   on the hospital has drawn condemnation from the United Nations, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank and is a rival to Hamas.
Under international humanitarian law, hospitals can lose their protected status if used for military purposes. But civilians must also be given ample time to flee, and any attack must be proportional to the military objective — putting the burden on Israel to show the hospital was a big enough military target to justify the siege against it.
Biden said Israel had gone into al-Shifa, with a limited number of troops with guns, and that Israel had an obligation to use as much caution as possible in going after targets.
Israel has said it is not only looking for Hamas fighters but also the captives, including a three-year-old US citizen, who have been held in Gaza for more than a month.
Netanyahu, who has led Israel on and off for 16 years and is facing corruption charges, is under intense domestic pressure to account for political and security failings that may have led to the Hamas attack, the worst in the country's history.
Protesters have taken to the streets demanding more be done to secure their release.
Biden said he was "mildly hopeful" there would be a deal to free them.
"I don't want to get ahead of myself here because I don't know what's happened in the last four hours, but we have gotten great cooperation from the Qataris," he said when asked about progress.
Qatar, where Hamas operates a political office, has been leading   between the group and Israeli officials.

How Palestinians in Gaza soothe their terrified children amid Israeli raids
Newstex Blogs

October 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza City – As another Israeli air raid thundered, eight-year-old Pretty Abu-Ghazzah stood shell-shocked, while her five-year-old twin brothers rushed to their mother Esraa's arms. Pretty's youngest sibling, aged two, cried loudly.
To escape the heavy bombardment in their neighbourhood of Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, Esraa brought her children to her in-laws' house in a less-targeted area. But there is no escaping the mental health effects of the raid.
"I can't bear to see my children trembling and their faces pale with terror. It's too painful. Pretty vomited several times today due to panic and fear," the 30-year-old mother said.
Making up nearly half of the 2.3 million people trapped in Gaza, children are suffering from the mental and emotional fallout of years of blockade and violence. According to a 2022 study  by the non-profit Save the Children, four out of five children in the enclave grapple with depression, grief and fear.
Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza, which it launched following the October 7 attacks by the armed wing of the Palestinian group Hamas, has killed at least 2,382 Palestinians and wounded 9,714 others so far. It has also left parents scrambling to keep their kids alive and mentally healthy through what they describe as the fiercest aggression they have faced in years.
After Israel cut off the electricity in Gaza last Monday, residents now live in the dark amid dwindling fuel supplies, which are needed to operate generators. Many parents use what limited internet access they have to seek advice for comforting their children on platforms like YouTube and WhatsApp support groups.
Esraa has been observing her children's reactions to the air attacks with growing concern. In addition to vomiting, they have been suffering from involuntary urination, a symptom she said is recent and highlights heightened fear.
'None of my children had faced issues with involuntary urination before,' she said.
In the 2022 Save the Children report, 79 percent of caregivers in Gaza reported an increase in bedwetting among children, compared with 53 percent in 2018. The last Israel-Hamas war was in 2021. Symptoms like increased difficulties in speech, language and communication as well as an inability to complete tasks also increased in children since 2018.
"I found a lot of helpful YouTube videos  during the last war on how to talk to children. It was important to engage in a conversation with them and discuss what was happening in their surroundings," Esraa said, adding that the impact of such strategies remains limited given the gruesome circumstances they are living through.

Engaging their minds
From the online resources, Esraa learned about keeping children entertained and engaged during conflict. One way was easing restrictions on screen time. "I usually limit my children's iPad usage but given these distressing circumstances, I allow them to watch cartoons to keep themselves entertained. I make sure to keep my iPad or cellphone charged while they watch [in case of an emergency]," she explained. Esraa also reads stories to her children.
Unlike in previous assaults on the territory, the Israeli Air Force has not been issuing warnings before shelling residential units, sending families racing for their lives.
In its Humanitarian Needs Overview  2022, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 678,000 children across Palestine need mental health and psychosocial support services. More than half of the children in Gaza are in need of such support. However, available mental healthcare has not been sufficient to address the significant need, especially during recurring times of distress. This leaves parents - who are facing their own mental health and emotional issues - to find ways to soothe their frightened children.
Esraa recalled that her children's playtime now often revolves around war and imitating their mother's phone calls to loved ones. 'My children look up to me and pretend to have phone conversations, asking each other: 'What's happening in your area?' They mimic me when I call my family members who live in different parts of Gaza, just to make sure they are okay,' Esraa explained.

Expressing themselves
Rawan, another mother in her 30s, said her three daughters are struggling with the reality of the violence they are confronting.
"This is the fifth war I've experienced as a mother and each time, I turn to YouTube and online articles to enhance my understanding of how to support my daughters during times of conflict," Rawan said.
However, her eldest daughter is experiencing accentuated symptoms. "My daughters, Aysel, 9, Areen, 6, and Aleen, 4, are profoundly affected by the terrifying sounds of bombings, especially Aysel. She's now old enough to understand the implications of war. She has stopped eating and drinking. I've also noticed an increase in her heart rate," she said.
Aleen, too, has displayed signs of food aversion and frequent trembling due to fear, Rawan said.
To ease their anxiety, Rawan tries to engage her daughters in group games and activities.
For guidance, Rawan has been turning to YouTube and awareness messages sent by her daughters' teachers to help mothers support their children's mental well-being. Among such advice is to monitor children closely for signs of anxiety that they may have difficulty expressing verbally. In this situation, mothers are advised to encourage their children to express themselves creatively, through writing stories or drawing as an outlet to process their feelings.
Like many people in Gaza seeking a safe haven from the shelling, Rawan and her family spent the first three days of the aggression in their home in the al-Nasr neighbourhood of Gaza City. However, after the bombings intensified near their residence, they relocated to the Nuseirat refugee camp near Deir el-Balah in the heart of the Gaza Strip.
As with Esraa's children, the relocation has not eased the mental unrest of Rawa's children. "They stick close to me at all times, even when I'm preparing meals. I constantly embrace and comfort them," she said in a helpless tone.
When her daughters ask about the ongoing war, Rawan tries to divert their attention by showing them photos and videos of happier times or engaging them with games, reading together and cuddling.
Unlike Esraa, Rawan feels compelled to limit her kids' use of mobile phones and iPads for entertainment, since these devices are essential for emergencies. She has also tried to restrict their exposure to news by turning off the television during war-related coverage.
Mental health support
Some mental health professionals have been providing free resources on social media. In a Facebook post, the Palestinian Counseling Center announced the formation of a national emergency team to provide 'free psychosocial support via phone calls and WhatsApp' to those who need it. The post includes a list of names and contacts of professional mental health and social work specialists across Palestine who are available to jump on calls. The page has shared a number of tips  on how to assist children under fire.

'Children are unavoidably influenced by the consequences of Israeli aggression, the rising levels of violence, the widespread dissemination of images depicting casualties and devastation, and the continuous sounds of explosions,' Muayad Jouda, a Gaza-based psychiatrist explained.
He said that children might display symptoms such as intense anger, incessant crying and prolonged fits of screaming. They may continuously discuss the ongoing war and even engage in playing games with violent themes.
Ansam, a mother of two, said that she has seen these behaviours in her two daughters, aged two and four. 'I hug them and comfort them because that's a motherly instinct and because as a mother and a human, I'm terrified. But amidst the massacres we're living through and witnessing, mental well-being is a luxury. All we want is for them to come out alive,' she said.
If you or someone you know is in Gaza and needs mental health support, the Palestinian Counseling Center  may be able to help.

Israel's war on Gaza in 10 explainers

October 28th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
As Israel's war on Gaza continues into its fourth week,it can be difficult to keep pace of events, grappling with the multiple dimensions of a rapidly escalating conflict that has already caused so much devastation.
Since Hamas launched its lightning attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,405 people and taking at least 200 hostages, Israel unleashed the full force of its firepower on besieged Palestinians in the Gaza Strip - more than 7,000 people have now been killed and the death toll rises almost every hour.
Amid the chaos, a battle of narratives is also being waged, pitting Israel's backers in the West against Palestinians and Middle Eastern nations that watched this catastrophe unfold at close quarters for the past 75 years. In this hot conflict, history matters.
Al Jazeera has been tackling the big questions about this asymmetrical war, to help you make sense of it.
Take a look at 10 must-read explainers:
The conflict did not start with the Hamas attack on October 7. It didn't even start with the creation of Hamas.
As a first stop, we suggest our simple guide to the Israel-Palestine conflict, from Arthur Balfour to the Nakba. We walk you through landmark developments decade by decade, with video and visuals, to decode the decades of injustice, dispossession, displacement and humiliation that have brought the region to this moment.
More than 70 years after the Nakba (catastrophe), protesters gather to attend 'Great March of Return' and 'Palestinian Land Day' demonstrations at the Israel-Gaza border in eastern Khan Younis, Gaza on March 30, 2019 [Ashraf Amra/Anadolu]
You've read the reports on the group's shock attack of October 7, the worst in Israel's history. But what does the name 'Hamas' actually mean? And how did this group, designated as a terrorist organisation by a number of countries, come to administer the lives of 2.3 million people in the Gaza Strip? What are its links with Iran, Syria and Lebanon's Hezbollah?
Hamas might control Gaza, but the West Bank is governed – notionally, at least – by the Palestinian Authority (PA). The pair had a civil war, which led to the PA losing control over Gaza in 2007. Governing the shrinking West Bank, the body has all the trappings of a state, but no real power. Many are now asking what its future might be after the war.

As the war escalates, it is possible that Israel may end up doing battle not only in Gaza and the West Bank, but also on its northern border with Hezbollah in Lebanon. With the threat of a regional war looming, Justin Salhani traces the history of tortured relations between Israel and Lebanon, going right back to 1948 and the creation of Israel.
How did we get here? In three weeks, Israel's intense bombing campaign has turned much of Gaza to rubble, killing thousands. But, as Indlieb Farazi Saber explains, the enclave was already struggling under a 16-year blockade before bombing turned an existing humanitarian disaster into a "catastrophe".
(Al Jazeera)
The Rafah border crossing has a central role in enabling humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and for trapped people in Gaza who want to leave to escape to safety. But who controls this border? Why have negotiations been so tricky? And what are the implications of throwing it open? Al Jazeera's Maziar Motamedi explains all.
The first casualty of war is truth. In the hours after the al-Ahli hospital explosion, which killed at least 400 people, Israel's jumbled and verifiably faked version of events cast serious doubt on its claims that the disaster had been caused by a misfired rocket from Palestinian Islamic Jihad. But, as Al Jazeera explains, sowing confusion is all part of the playbook.

Al Jazeera's Indlieb Farazi Saber asks psychologists about the mental toll that war exacts on its youngest victims — many of whom, in Gaza, have barely survived after being buried under rubble from buildings brought down by Israeli missiles.
How does trauma manifest in children? And do they stand any chance of recovery?
How are abuses against children even allowed to happen? Countless numbers of children have lost their homes, face shortages of food, water and medicine, their education disrupted for the foreseeable future. Areesha Lodhi explains how the Geneva Conventions, the basis for the laws of war, apply to children.

How will this war end? In the immediate aftermath of Hamas's brutal attack and Israel's no-limits counteroffensive, Al Jazeera took a look at the diplomatic chessboard to explain who might play a role in making peace. As the situation escalates, positions have oscillated. But the broad brushstrokes of alliances in the making are set out in this explainer.

Israeli air attacks have hit the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, and initial reports suggest a large number of casualties.
The attack on Monday came as Israel has launched a massive air campaign against targets in Gaza after an   by Hamas that started on Saturday.
The Palestinian news agency WAFA said the attack hit a market area, "killing and wounding dozens and causing heavy destruction". The Reuters news agency also quoted the Gaza-based Ministry of Health as saying the attack has killed and wounded dozens of people.
Footage captured by Al Jazeera showed frantic scenes as rescue workers began to pull people from under the rubble.
A school run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) was also hit in the attack on the camp, according to Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed.
Reporting from Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, ElSayed said "dozens" of casualties had been brought there, including children.
She added that another Israeli attack hit the Shati refugee camp, also known as Beach Camp.
Overall, more than 500 Palestinians   and about 2,700 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza as of Monday afternoon.
In Israel, the toll has surpassed 800 with more than 2,200 wounded in the attacks that began on Saturday with Hamas sending fighters into Israel and firing thousands of rockets.
Fighters broke through Israeli barriers with explosives and carried out attacks that killed civilians in towns and on highways while others were taken captive and moved to Gaza. More than 250 people attending a music festival were among those killed, according to the Zaka volunteer group, which helped collect the bodies.
'Total blockade'
Also on Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel would impose a "  " on Gaza, including a ban on admitting food and fuel and cutting off its electricity.
Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz also issued an order 'to immediately cut the water supply' to Gaza, his spokesperson said.
Gaza has been under a crippling air, land and sea blockade since 2007 with devastating consequences for its more than two million residents, who face  , as well as a lack of medicines.
'Nobody can anticipate what will happen in the coming days,' Al Jazeera's Jamileh Abu Zanoon said, reporting from Gaza City.
'Power stations are running out of electricity. … There will be no electricity, food or water."
Palestinians in Gaza braced for what many feared will be an Israeli ground attack aiming to defeat Hamas and liberate at least 100 Israeli hostages.
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned civilians to get away from all Hamas sites, which he has promised to turn "to rubble".
The army said it had called up about 300,000 reservists and said in a statement it would aim to end Hamas's rule of Gaza.
'We have never drafted so many reservists on such a scale,' Israel's chief military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, told reporters. 'We are going on the offensive.'

Former Biden campaign staffers call for Israel-Hamas ceasefire

November 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - More than 500 former campaign staffers who helped elect Joe Biden in 2020 have called on the United States president to work towards a ceasefire in Gaza and end   that has killed more than 10,800 Palestinians.
The letter released on Thursday adds to the growing calls from sources close to the Biden administration to push for an end to the war.
"As President of the United States, you have significant influence in this perilous moment," the letter, first reported by Vox , said.
"You must call for a ceasefire, hostage exchange, and de-escalation, and take concrete steps to address the conditions of occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing at the root of the horrific violence we are witnessing now."
While the Biden administration and Congress remain steadfast in their support for Israel, staff members, grassroots organisations and activists have been expressing growing opposition to the war.
The American Postal Workers Union, which represents US Postal Service employees, also backed calls for a ceasefire on Thursday.
"We call on our government, which is the primary   of the Israeli government, to use all its power to protect innocent lives and to help bring about peace in the region, and not use our tax dollars for more war," the union said in a statement.
"We join the calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, and urgently needed massive humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. The cries of humanity demand nothing less."
Growing calls
The two statements follow earlier efforts from within the government to push for an end to hostilities.
Last week, employees at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) circulated   calling for an immediate ceasefire, and by Wednesday, it had surpassed 1,000 signatures.
Hundreds of Congress staffers also staged a walk-out on Wednesday to demand an end to the war.
Thursday's letter by people who worked on Biden's campaign highlighted the mounting death toll in Gaza and the mass displacement of residents in the territory's northern reaches, noting that scholars have raised alarm about the risk of genocide in the conflict.
The Democratic staffers also said they were "horrified by the devastating   against Israeli civilians on October 7″.
United Nations agencies and rights groups have also urged a ceasefire, with UN chief   warning that Gaza is becoming a 'graveyard for children'.
But early Thursday, Biden ruled out any definitive stop to the conflict. When reporters asked about the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza, the US president said, "None, no possibility."
Biden has voiced unconditional support for Israel and requested more than $14bn in   for the country since its war in Gaza started on October 7, angering US progressives, Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims.
Last month, the US president   among Palestinian rights supporters when he cast doubt over the death toll in Gaza, saying that he has 'no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using'.
Rights experts and fact-checkers defended the numbers, which are released by the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza based on hospital and morgue records. They explained that, in previous conflicts, the Health Ministry's numbers matched the findings of independent researchers.
A senior State Department official also said on Wednesday that the actual Palestinian death toll may be even higher than the official numbers.
"In this period of conflict and conditions of war, it is very difficult for any of us to assess what the rate of casualties are," Barbara Leaf, assistant US secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, told lawmakers. "We think they're very high, frankly — and it could be that they're even higher than are being cited."
The Health Ministry has also said that its current statistics do not account for people who remain under the rubble or who were buried without being registered.
'His legacy will be genocide'
When Biden ran for president, his supporters often portrayed him as a "decent" man aiming to restore unity in the US after the presidency of  .
Biden has suffered personal grief in his life, having lost his wife and young daughter in a car accident in 1972 and his son Beau, a politician and army veteran, to cancer in 2015.
The campaign staffers' statement called out the US president for appearing to play down — if not dismiss — civilian casualties in Gaza.
"Mr President, you have spoken intimately about the unbearable pain and grief of losing a child," the letter said. "We were shocked and saddened to see you justify the death of Palestinian children as 'the price of waging a war'."
Biden made that comment while questioning the Palestinian death count on October 25, in an appearance  before reporters at the White House. "I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it is the price of waging war," he said.
As the US president faces pressure from his own base, his approval ratings among Democrats are slumping. He is also seeing an enormous   in Arab communities.
A recent New York Times poll  showed Biden losing to Trump — the likely Republican nominee in the 2024 race — in five key swing states: Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
Heba Mohammad, a Palestinian American staffer who worked for the Biden campaign in another swing state, Wisconsin, warned that the carnage in Gaza may become what people remember him for.
"President Biden has the ability and responsibility to save lives and reduce human suffering," she said in a statement accompanying the letter. "If he doesn't act swiftly, his legacy will be genocide."

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) have spoken on the phone about the  , in their first call since Tehran and Riyadh restored ties.
The two leaders discussed on Wednesday 'the need to end war crimes against Palestine', Iranian presidential political affairs aide Mohammad Jamshidi said on X.
'Islamic unity was stressed and both believed the regime's crimes and the US green light will cause destructive insecurity for the regime and backers.'
Saudi state news agency SPA said that MBS stressed the "necessity of adhering to the principles of international humanitarian law and expressed deep concern for the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and its impact on civilians."
The Saudi crown prince also said the kingdom was exerting "maximum effort to engage with all international and regional parties to halt the ongoing escalation," SPA said.
The two leaders' talks came as Israel carried out air raids on Gaza for a fourth consecutive day following Hamas's multipronged attack inside Israel over the weekend.
More than 1,200 Palestinians in Gaza and 1,300 people in Israel have been killed in the violence so far, according to Palestinian and Israeli officials.
  under a China-brokered deal that drew a line under seven years of hostility between the sides.
Riyadh severed ties with Tehran in 2016 after protesters invaded Saudi diplomatic posts in Iran, following Saudi Arabia's execution of a prominent Shia scholar.

Shooter kills Tel Aviv policeman in Israel; suspect gunned down

A gunman opened fire in central Tel Aviv and killed an Israeli police inspector before he was shot dead by a responding officer.
Amateur video circulated online of police and civilians on Saturday running through the cafe-lined streets in the seaside metropolis.
Police identified the gunman as Kamel Abu Bakr, 27, from a village near the flashpoint city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank.
The man wounded in the shooting was a municipal patrol worker who was targeted when he approached the suspect after noticing something suspicious. He was taken to hospital "in critical condition" and later died, according to the Magen David Adom emergency service.
"Another municipal inspector responded swiftly and managed to neutralise the terrorist," police said, adding that "significant police forces are present at the scene".
"We are standing at a very sad incident," Tel Aviv's Mayor Ron Huldai told Israel's public broadcaster.
The shooter is suspected to be a resident of the Palestinian town of Jenin in the occupied West Bank.

Near-nightly raids
Jenin's refugee camp last month was the site of the largest Israeli offensive in the occupied West Bank in nearly 20 years. Twelve Palestinians, including at least eight fighters, and one Israeli soldier, were killed in the raid, which forced thousands to flee their homes and left large swaths of the camp in ruins.
Tensions in the occupied territory have intensified since early last year when Israel began its near-nightly raids into Palestinian areas.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed this year in the occupied Palestinian territories and the Gaza Strip, the majority in the occupied West Bank.
This year is already the deadliest for Palestinians since the United Nations began keeping track of fatalities in 2005.
Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war, along with the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. Palestinians seek those territories for their hoped-for independent state.

In the midst of Israel's assault, people of Gaza still don't want the PA

November 7th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza Strip – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said Israel would govern the security of the Gaza Strip for an   after the ongoing war, in comments that came amid a growing debate over what the besieged strip might look like after the war.
Israel and its biggest ally, the United States, have insisted that Hamas – currently in power in Gaza – cannot be allowed to continue to rule the strip, following its attack on southern Israel on October 7, in which an estimated 1,400 people were killed.
However, Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, called for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip on Sunday and indicated that the PA would be   to the besieged enclave as part of a future political settlement.
'We will fully assume our responsibilities within the framework of a comprehensive political solution that includes all of the [occupied] West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip,' Abbas was quoted as telling United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken by the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
  was visiting Ramallah, the PA's seat in the occupied West Bank.
So how do people in Gaza view the prospect of the PA taking power in the besieged Strip 17 years after Hamas won legislative elections, and then a military battle against Fatah, the political arm of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), chaired by Abbas?
Here are some voices from the ground:
Mohamed, 25
I don't think the PA taking over Gaza is a solution people will accept or support. I reject it because I can see what's happening in the West Bank, which is under PA's control.
There are always raids into so many towns and people are always arrested in these areas considered under the PA's rule.
They don't change anything on the ground. This is why its rule will not benefit Gaza in any way. I would be for a national unity government [including Hamas, Fatah and other Palestinian factions].
That would be much better.
Kamal, 53
The PA will not protect Gaza because it participated in its siege repeatedly and oppressed the people of Gaza, all because of its dispute with Hamas. We don't believe it can be fair in Gaza.
The president always gives these speeches talking about Gaza and his responsibility towards it, but he doesn't do what he says.
The evidence is the siege and the explosion that occurred in Gaza. If the  , it may have been good in Gaza.
But we can see that the return of the PA is impossible. It can only come as part of a national unity government chosen by the people.
Somaia, 29
The West Bankis enough of an example of how life is for other Palestinians under the rule of the PA. The Israeli occupation has an iron fist that strikes at the simplest rights of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories.
The only solution, or any next move that should be discussed now, should prioritise the means of how to dismantle years of occupation and military rule across the occupied territories.
That will help whoever runs Gaza, from among the Palestinian factions, to do what is best for the people, and for the people only.
Abu Hakeem, 45
Whether the PA is a valid alternate player that could take power over two million people here doesn't seem to be a priority question for people right now.
What the US and the PA are discussing now, no matter what, can't be enough to guarantee the safety of my family or thousands of others who are currently in Gaza under fire from Israeli warplanes.
Ahmed, 33
We have been calling for years for the mere human rights that we need to have a life – like employment, electricity, clean water, freedom of movement and the right to seek medical referral outside.
The legitimacy of the PA as a suitable power, and of any other ruler in Gaza, comes into the equation only when we have enough for a good life and survival from this hell.

Nice footballer Atal detained for sharing alleged anti-Semitic content

November 24th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
French authorities have said that Algerian footballer   was detained for questioning and will stand trial for sharing a social media post that purportedly encouraged violence against Jews.
In a statement on Friday, prosecutors said that police detained Atal, who plays for French club Nice, for questioning on Thursday as part of a probe into possible 'justification of terrorism' over the post.
He was released on bail of 80,000 euros ($87,500) on Friday, and placed under judicial supervision pending the trial. He is not allowed to leave France except for international games.
The 27-year-old footballer was suspended for seven games by the French football league for sharing a social media post last month in which a Palestinian preacher allegedly made anti-Semitic statements calling for violence against Jews.
Al Jazeera was not able to confirm the contents of the post, which Atal quickly deleted and apologised for.
Nice authorities opened an investigation into the matter, and prosecutors have said that Atal, who has been suspended by his club 'until further notice', will face trial on December 18 for possible incitement to religious hatred.
Atal has said that he would 'never support a message of hate' and that he condemns violence 'no matter where in the world' but has not offered an explanation for why he shared the video.
The Nice defender is one of several footballers who have faced criticism or penalties for social media posts amid the   between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas that has created simmering tensions in communities around the world.
After French football star   criticised "unjust bombings which spare no women or children" in a social media post about Israel's assault on Gaza, which Palestinian authorities say has killed more than 6,500 children, France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin accused him — without evidence — of having links to the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood.
A French senator also called on Benzema to be stripped of previous football awards as well as his French citizenship.
On Thursday, a council member of the Football Association (FA), English football's governing body, resigned after comparing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.
"Recent events have left me bereft of energy and hope. I have felt overwhelmed at how this has transpired," Wasim Haq said in a resignation letter posted to social media, in which he said that he had meant to criticise a politician and not Jewish people more widely.
"As someone who has worked closely with many Jewish people over the years and created meaningful and valued friendships, the most painful part of this process is knowing that some of those friends and colleagues may not forgive me for the misunderstanding and hurt I have unintentionally caused.'
Dutch footballer   was also expelled from the German football team Mainz 05 after social media posts in support of Palestine, despite reiterating his opposition to anti-Semitism and violence against civilians.
El Ghazi has taken legal action against the club over his termination.

August 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Jenin, occupied West Bank – A commander of a Palestinian armed group has been killed by Israeli forces and his older brother arrested in an early morning raid, the Palestinian health ministry said.
Mustafa al-Kastoni was shot in the head, chest and stomach, the ministry said, and was pronounced dead at the government hospital in Jenin, in the northern occupied West Bank.
The 32-year-old was one of the commanders of Fatah's armed wing in Jenin, known as the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.
A Palestinian woman who "supports medical professionals" was also shot in the chest and abdomen during the raid, the health ministry said.
Jenin's deputy governor, Kamal Abu al-Rub, said she was in critical condition.
Al-Kastoni's father, Akram, told Al Jazeera that Mustafa was wanted by Israeli authorities immediately after he was released from an Israeli jail six months ago.
"Special forces entered the city and arrested one of my sons. Mustafa was in our home," he said.

The elder al-Kastoni had left the house at 5am to go to work in the industrial zone, and when he heard the sounds of bullets, he raced back to try to reach his home.
"I knew they were coming for Mustafa," the 57-year-old said. "I couldn't get to the house and saw a civilian car with Israeli soldiers and my other son Hani who they had arrested. The soldiers told me if I took a step further they would shoot me."
According to the Israeli outlet Haaretz, a spokesperson for the Israeli military said its soldiers arrested a number of wanted Palestinians belonging to the Islamic Jihad group and returned fire after being shot at by armed fighters during the raid.
The spokesperson said Mustafa al-Kastoni shot at the forces and tried to escape during an attempt to arrest him. One Israeli soldier was lightly wounded by shrapnel and taken to the hospital.
But Basema Sabaaneh, Mustafa's mother, said her son was unarmed and had called out that he would give himself up.
"I heard Mustafa, who was on the first floor, shouting to the soldiers that he'd surrender, and not to shoot because there are children in the building," she told Al Jazeera, shaking her head emphatically.
Sabaaneh had been on the second floor of the family building, where she lived with her son Hani's family.
"We heard banging noises [from the floor below], and the sound of dogs attacking him," she said. "He screamed again that he would surrender, and then we heard bullets being fired."

Muhammad Ajawi, who works at the Noor Bakery close to the al-Kastoni house in Jenin's old city, said he and nine other workers were forced out of the bakery at gunpoint.
"At about 6am, Israeli special units surrounded the area," he said. "They were in military uniforms but came in civilian cars. They made us stand by the bakery's entrance."
Ajawi said that the soldiers besieged the house but did not call on anyone to surrender, instead firing "randomly".
" A quarter of an hour later, they brought two young men handcuffed and blindfolded, and sat them down with us," Ajawi said. "They said to one of them, 'We killed your brother, get in the car and don't say a single word.'"
The soldiers then disappeared into the house for 10 minutes, then withdrew and blew up the house.
"We were only several metres away from the explosion, very close," Ajawi said. "My legs were wounded, and the rest of the workers were injured by debris from the blast."

The workers and Mustafa's father went to search among the rubble for Mustafa, finding him after 15 minutes.
"His body was strewn with bullets," Akram al-Kastoni said. "We pulled him out of the house and took him to the hospital, but he was gone."
Videos circulated  on social media show men pulling al-Kastoni's lifeless body out of a window, where a crowd of men below were waiting with a stretcher.
Other images shared by Palestinian activists showed al-Kastoni as a young boy in the second Intifada 20 years ago, an Israeli Merkava battle tank behind him.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed since the beginning of the year, in what the United Nations warned is the deadliest year for Palestinians since it began recording fatalities in 2006.
The occupied West Bank has been witnessing escalating violence due to the near-nightly raids by Israeli forces of Palestinian cities and towns, after the emergence of a growing movement of cross-factional armed fighters.
In a statement, the Jenin Battalion for the Islamic Jihad's armed wing al-Quds Brigades said Israeli forces sent in reinforcements after its resistance fighters targeted them with bullets and explosives.

The battalion mourned al-Kastoni and said it "will remain, along with all the forces of resistance and free people, the spearhead in fighting the brutal occupation until victory or martyrdom".
Palestinian political factions condemned the Israeli raid. The leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) said: "The aggression against the city of Jenin is part of the plan that targets the resistance in all Palestinian lands."
Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif al-Qanou said Palestinian resistance in the occupied West Bank is unified.
"Day after day, it leaves its mark, confirming its permanence and its continuous confrontation with the Israeli occupation," he said.
"The assassination of the resistance fighter, Mustafa al-Kastoni, will not affect the unity or the resolve of the resistance fighters," he added and called on the Palestinian Authority to stop all forms of security coordination with Israel.

Surrounded by death, Gaza content creators fight to get the truth out

Gaza Strip – Ahmed Hijazi was one of the first people to arrive at the al-Rimal neighbourhood in Gaza City hours after Israeli bombing wreaked havoc and   to a shadow of what it was.
The neighbourhood, with its trendy cafes, boutiques, apartment buildings and villas, was bombed last Wednesday, leaving a trail of destruction, debris, broken glass, and hollowed-out structures.
Hijazi, a content creator and programme presenter with more than 980,000 followers on Instagram , was there to fulfil the mission he has been on since the Israeli assault on Gaza began: to show the world what was happening.
"Our role has shifted … to communicating to the outside world what the Israeli army is doing in its aggression against us," Hijazi said.
Before the assault, he used his social media presence to shed light on community initiatives and showcase life in Gaza, with all its beauty in spite of the blockade and suffering.
"There is nothing left in Gaza. The war has destroyed any beauty and has devastated so much."
'It's where our love grew'
Gaza high-rises have been levelled, like Palestine Tower and al-Badrasawi, where Hijazi's wife used to have her photography studio.
"We had some beautiful moments there, that's where our love for each other grew," Hijazi said.
Now, he posts videos from inside hospitals, showing terrified children in agony who survived Israel's attacks on their homes, and doctors battling exhaustion and coming face to face with the death and injuries of their loved ones.

"What we're witnessing will never leave me," he said. "What affected me the most was the newborn baby whose entire family was killed, the children selling black pepper at the doors of the UNRWA schools their families fled to, and the injured child who was consoling his father in the hospital."
Battling the algorithm, too
But Hijazi, echoing many others who post Palestine content, says his content has been shadow-banned, which is when a social media platform blocks a user's content from showing up without notifying the user.
'My account has been closed twice, my followers' access to my posts has been restricted, and my content from photos and videos have been hidden," he said.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said it was taking  "specific steps" to monitor its content amid the violence, and said support and praise for Hamas is banned on its platforms. But Palestinians and others have accused Meta of restricting content that depicts Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip as part of the Western media's pro-Israel bias.

The comedian who cried
Mahmoud Zuaiter is popularly known as the "Minister of Happiness" to his more than 600,000 followers. The comedian, who co-founded popular Gaza City-based comedy troupe Tashweesh in 2012, has made a   using satire to keep people 'smiling and laughing'.
"Our role as influencers is to convey the truth of what is happening in Gaza," he said. "We've managed by circulating the videos that we share on social media sites to Arabic TV channels such as Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya."
Zuaiter, whose followers have increased by the tens of thousands since Israel began bombarding Gaza on October 7, added that content from the Gaza Strip must reach the whole world, not just Arab countries.
"We noticed that Palestinian content in Arabic is limited to Arab countries and needs to be translated," he said. "It helps a lot if the influencers here have good English because their role is to convey what's happening to us to the world."
The 37-year-old, who posted comedy skits before, says the current situation is extremely difficult with no joy anywhere.
"One of the most emotional scenes I saw was people fleeing with little to no belongings from north to south," he said.
According to the United Nations, more than one million Palestinians have been internally displaced in the blockaded Strip in 10 days, with nowhere to go.
"I cried when I saw people leaving," Zuaiter said, saying displacement keeps replaying in the history of Palestinians, starting with the 1948 Nakba, or Catastrophe, that forcibly displaced 750,000 people.

"I took a video and shared it on social networking sites," he said. "Some followers asked me to be more optimistic, but I'm not going to hide my feelings as a Palestinian in Gaza living through this."
Families of journalists and influencers killed
More than 2,800 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli air attacks, a third of them children. The   killing 11 so far, nor their families.
The killing of popular artist, actor and digital creator Ali Nisman, who had nearly 200,000 followers on Facebook, was a shock to his fans.
Nisman, whose last video  on Facebook was uploaded last Wednesday, was killed two days later on October 13.
"This is Gaza and, I swear, if they kill us all, our graves will fight back," he said as explosions sounded and smoke rose behind him.
One of his last messages  on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, was poignant: "My friends, trust in God and His mercy … If we are cut off, we will meet either in Jerusalem or in heaven."
Since the beginning of the war, 11 journalists have been killed.
Anadolu Agency's photographer Ali Jadallah, who covered every Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip since 2008, lost his three younger brothers and father last week after an Israeli missile targeted their apartment building in the Sheikh Radwan area, northwest of Gaza City.
A widely circulated video showed Jadallah crouching over the rubble, kissing the ashen, exposed hand of his mother, who ended up being the sole survivor. Jadallah's sister's body is still under the debris.
Jadallah himself shared  a video of himself driving his car with his father's body in the backseat, going to bury him alone as there was no time for funeral rites or a burial attended by others.
Motaz Azaiza, another photojournalist with more than a million followers on Instagram , filmed the aftermath of an Israeli attack that targeted his family home in the Deir al-Balah refugee camp. At least 15 members of his family, most of them women and children, were killed. One of the body bags contained the body parts of two of his younger cousins.
Fighting predominant narratives in Western media has given social media users in Gaza more drive to share the truth about Israel's siege and being cut off from water, food, electricity and communication inside and outside the Gaza Strip.
But with little to zero network connectivity, many people are using hospitals running on generators to charge their phones and devices.
"Everyone cares about staying in touch not just with the world but with their own families who fled their homes," Ahmed Hijazi said.
"Each of us has a role in conveying the truth," he added.

Iran's top diplomat discusses Israel's war in Gaza with Hezbollah leader

November 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Iran's top diplomat has met the leader of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah in an undisclosed location in Lebanon, discussing efforts to end Israel's war in Gaza.
The meeting of Iran's Hossein Amirabdollahian and Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah as Israel and Palestinian group Hamas ready for an upcoming four-day humanitarian pause and a deal that is expected to free 50 Israelis held captive in Gaza and 150 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.
The warring sides are still   of the Qatar-brokered deal, which Israel says will not take effect 'before Friday'.
Amirabdollahian, speaking to the Beirut-based Al Mayadeen channel on Wednesday, warned that if the ceasefire does not hold, 'the scope of the war will expand'.
Amirabdollahian left Beirut for Qatar's capital Doha after meeting Nasrallah, Iran's Nour news agency reported.
Israel's northern front
Hezbollah, a close ally of Iran, has repeatedly traded deadly cross-border fire with Israel since the start of the Gaza war on October 7, raising fears of a broader conflagration.
Hezbollah said on Thursday morning that it fired 48 Katyusha rockets at an Israeli military base at Ein Zeitim, near the town of Safed about 10km (6 miles) from the border.
The group said it also carried out at least 10 other attacks on Israeli positions near the frontier, which it claimed had caused casualties.
The Israeli army hit several areas in southern Lebanon in retaliation, according to Lebanon's National News Agency.
Hezbollah says it has been acting in support of Hamas since the Palestinian group's surprise October 7 incursion in southern Israel, which Israeli officials say killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 people taken captive.
Israel has promised to destroy Hamas and launched a relentless air and ground offensive on the Gaza Strip, killing more than 14,500 people, about 6,000 of them children, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health.
The violence between Israel and Hezbollah has killed at least 108 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but also at least 14 civilians, including three journalists, the AFP news agency reported.
Six Israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed on the Israeli side, according to the authorities.

Why Singapore is 'friend of all, enemy of none' in Israel-Gaza war

November 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Singapore - Since the  , the tiny Southeast Asian city-state of Singapore has taken a stance of non-interference, reflecting a long-held foreign policy focused on being a 'friend to all and enemy to none'.
At a special parliamentary session earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong explained  that Singapore's 'longstanding support for a two-state solution remains unchanged', in that Palestinian people have the right to a homeland and that Israel has the right to live within secure borders, he added.
Singapore 'consistently takes a principled position' in line with international law and support of global peace and security, Wong stressed.
The country has come out strongly to condemn Hamas's October 7 assault on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and some 200 taken captive, as 'acts of terrorism".
But it has also condemned the rising death toll in Gaza, with the foreign ministry saying on Friday that it was 'deeply concerned' about the humanitarian situation in the besieged enclave where more than 13,000 people have been killed since Israel's bombardment began.
In late October, Singapore was among the 120 countries voting in favour of a   and uphold legal and humanitarian obligationsduring an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Singapore's approach is 'premised on the faithful observance of international law, especially the independence and sovereignty of nation-states,' said political analyst and Singapore Management University (SMU) associate law professor Eugene Tan.
Tan told Al Jazeera there was 'no contradiction' in Singaporeans empathising with the plight of the Palestinians and taking the stance that the attacks on Israel cannot be justified.
At the same time, it is 'also possible to support Israel's right to defend itself and for Israel to avail itself of the use of force to protect its legitimate interests but also demand that Israel's response must be consistent with the rules and requirements of public international law so that the safety, security and wellbeing of civilians are safeguarded,' he said.
'What the debate in parliament demonstrated is that Singaporeans can hold very strong views on the tragedy unfolding in the Middle East region and yet come to a consensus on how Singapore and Singaporeans should respond In short, Singapore firmly believes that Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in peace, security and dignity."
'Generally risk averse'
Still, unlike many countries around the world, there have been no public protests in favour of either the Palestinians or Israel in Singapore.
Singapore - with a mostly ethnic Chinese population but also with a sizeable ethnic Malay-Muslim minority as well as ethnic Indians - has long prioritised preserving social cohesion and religious harmony.
The city-state came into being on August 9, 1965, after it separated from Malaysia, forming 'the backdrop to Singapore's commitment on the right to self-determination in accordance with international law', said Tan.
Given ' heightened sensitivities ' surrounding the latest conflict, the Singapore government, which allows protests only by citizens and only in the so-called "Speakers' Corner" in the city centre, has argued that strong preemptive measures are necessary to manage the situation, citing the risk to public safety as well as security concerns.
Authorities rejected five applications to use the Speakers' Corner for events related to the Israel-Hamas war in October, despite having allowed rallies during a previous war in 2014. It has also warned  against the public display of foreign national emblems relating to the conflict and told people to be careful about supporting fundraising activities.
"My hunch is that the current situation is a lot more sensitive and emotive than in 2014, and it involves terrorist acts by Hamas," Tan said. "I would say it is more a case of not importing foreign issues that will only create social divisions."
Singaporean community organiser Zaris Azira was feeling helpless watching the news about Gaza on her phone, when she came across a video of thousands of Malaysians chanting for Palestine in their football stadium.
Protests were allowed in 2014 but this time, the government has talked of 'heightened sensitivities' [File: Wallace Woon/EPA]
The 30-year-old felt motivated to do something more.
Azira applied for a permit to organise a rally at the Speakers' Corner and found that 'interest exploded', with 740 people registering their interest to attend in less than a day. She also released a petition for Singaporeans to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, drafted in consultation with local political observer Walid J Abdullah. As of November 20, it had 26,280 signatures.
Expressing disappointment at the rejection of her application, Azira said she was not surprised, given Singapore is 'generally quite risk-averse as a nation, and I understand the desire to avoid any situation that could potentially spiral out of hand".
Singaporean activism has tended to the more subtle.
On social media, people have joined campaigns such as the #freewatermelontoday campaign or the #weargreenforpalestine movement.
An underground movement also emerged for people to show up at the Raffles Place MRT train station in green and say a prayer for Palestine, while others have taken pictures with a  , which has become a symbol of Palestinian solidarity.
'More and more, people want to show their solidarity with the people of Palestine, who are going through such unspeakable horrors on a daily basis. Singaporeans need an outlet to demonstrate safely, legally and powerfully,' Azira said.
Local journalist and activist Kirsten Han expressed similar views in her newsletter We The Citizens, arguing that clamping down on freedom of expression and assembly would affect Singaporeans' ability to participate in nuanced and important conversations.
Calling the warnings and restrictions 'infantilising', she said: 'We need civil society involvement, well-facilitated discussions, opportunities to educate ourselves and organise in non-violent ways for justice and human rights.'
Han added that the ability to be together in a physical space can 'also be incredibly powerful in helping people process the devastation we're seeing in the news every single day.'
In contrast, SMU's Tan argues that the authorities' move was prudent because of the potential for such actions to 'detrimentally affect our hard-earned social cohesion and harmony".
'Protests make for good social media posts and rabble-rousing but will not move the needle on the conflict,' he said.

Humanitarian assistance
In the absence of public protests, Singaporean civil society and faith communities have instead devoted their efforts to organising humanitarian aid for Gaza.
As of November 14, about 6 million Singapore dollars ($4.5m) have been donated by the public through the non-profit Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation (RLAF). Elsewhere, disaster relief organisation Relief Singapore has put out an urgent call for blankets, receiving about 2,500 to date. The blankets will be sent to the Gaza Strip, where winter temperatures can drop as low as 13C (55.4F).
'While we are aware of the politics involved in the conflict, our focus is on the most pressing humanitarian needs,' said Relief Singapore director Jonathan How. 'We know the vulnerable may die of cold as winter approaches in a city that looks more like an earthquake zone. We hope that more people will step up to lend their support in this crisis.'
Ultimately, in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Singapore has key national security priorities linked directly to stable relations with its closest neighbours, according to Arvind Rajanthran, an associate research fellow with the National Security Studies Programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University.
Its next-door neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia have 'Malay-Muslim majorities that frequently experience more politically charged atmospherics from the antagonism between the Israelis and Palestinians', said Rajanthran. Both countries have seen large demonstrations in support of Gaza.
So, it was significant that at the 10th Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat held on October 30, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim agreed that their different diplomatic positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should not affect the bilateral relationship, Rajanthran pointed out.
Singapore's "friend to all" approach to foreign policy appears to have allowed it to establish longstanding good relations with both Palestine and Israel.

The government has committed substantial technical assistance and support to the Palestinian Authority, which controls the occupied West Bank, over the years, and will continue to do so, Deputy Prime Minister Wong said in parliament.
Meanwhile, Israel helped build up the Singapore Armed Forces during Singapore's early years and Singapore continues to cooperate closely with the country in many areas, including in science and technology, he said.
In his speech to parliament, Wong said regional internet traffic on hardline sites had increased threefold since the start of the Israel-Gaza war.
'We have also observed an uptick in anti-Singapore rhetoric, including violent threats against Singapore by regional extremist elements online,' he said.
Islamophobia and anti-Semitism have also increased.
In October, police received eight reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at Jewish or Muslim people in Singapore, Wong noted. This was equal to the total number of reports on anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim conduct that police received from January to September.
Being a small state, Singapore has 'little choice' but to continue its policy of non-state interference, said political scientist Antonio Rappa, an associate professor at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS).
To take the side of Israel would risk antagonising Singapore's local Muslim community unnecessarily, while supporting Palestine would betray Israel - an 'unwritten ally' of Singapore since the days of its founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, said Rappa, who is head of the security studies programme at SUSS's business school.
Singapore has had close diplomatic ties with Israel since its independence in 1965, while Muslim-majority  , Malaysia and Brunei have no formal diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv.

On the strict controls taken by the government to clamp down on public rallies, Rappa explained that Singapore has been operating within a climate of fear for decades.
Pointing to the idea of a garrison state, Singapore still has a 'fortress-like' mentality that persists today, especially as a Chinese-majority nation surrounded by larger mostly-Muslim countries, which might 'create a certain degree of tension".
'Still, it is not wise for us to bring in other people's problems and import it into our country and create tensions within the population. We don't want animosity and chaos created for Singapore,' he said.

Israel stages large overnight ground raid into Gaza Strip

Israeli troops and tanks have carried out a brief yet relatively large overnight ground incursion into Gaza ahead of a widely expected full-scale ground invasion after nearly three weeks of devastating air raids on the besieged Palestinian enclave.
Video of the overnight action issued by the Israeli army on Thursday showed armoured vehicles proceeding through a sandy border zone. A bulldozer is seen levelling part of a raised bank, tanks fire shells, and explosions are seen near or amid a row of damaged buildings.
"Overnight, the IDF conducted a targeted raid using tanks in the northern Gaza Strip, as part of preparations for the next stages of combat," the Israeli military said in a statement on Thursday. "The soldiers exited the area at the end of the activity."
Israel has already made several limited advances into the Gaza Strip over the past two and a half weeks, but this was the biggest incursion of the current war, according to Israel's Army Radio.
'There have been similar attacks in the past where soldiers crossed into Gaza. What makes this one unusual is that it is the first time that tanks have been involved,' said Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem.
'According to the Israeli army, they moved in with specific targets in mind. The Israeli army claims to have killed a number of Hamas fighters and to have damaged a significant amount of infrastructure that could be used by the Palestinian group.'
'They also stated that they had targeted antitank posts that had been set up. This is clearly in preparation for what the next stage of the war will be,' our correspondent said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday evening that along with the heavy bombing campaign of Gaza, "we are preparing for a ground offensive".
Al Jazeera's Fisher said, 'Netanyahu has mentioned that the preparations are in their final stages, and the Israeli war cabinet will make a unanimous decision on when to proceed.'
(Al Jazeera)
The ground raid comes after the United Nations warned it is on the verge of running out of fuel in the Gaza Strip, forcing it to sharply curtail relief efforts in the territory, which has also been under a complete siege since Israel launched strikes that have killed more than 6,500 Palestinians in less than three weeks.
The strikes began after a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7, which killed 1,400 Israelis.
Palestinian health officials said the Gaza death toll was soaring as Israeli jets pounded the enclave. Workers pulled dead and wounded civilians, including many children, out of landscapes of rubble in cities across the territory.
Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, Israel is continuing raids and arrests; Palestinian authorities say more than 1,200 people have been detained by Israel, and at least 103 have been killed since October 7.
The rising death tolls in Gaza are unprecedented in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even greater loss of life could come if Israel launches an expected ground offensive aimed at crushing Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007 and survived four previous wars with Israel.
The conflict has also threatened to spread across the region. The Israeli military said it struck military sites in Syria in response to rocket launches from the country. Syrian state media said eight soldiers were killed and seven wounded.
Air strikes in Syria also hit the airports of Aleppo and Damascus, in an apparent attempt to prevent arms shipments from Iran to regional groups, including Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Israel has been exchanging near-daily fire with Iranian-backed Hezbollah across the Lebanese border.

Biden weighs Israel visit after Netanyahu extends invite amid Gaza war

October 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
President Joe Biden is considering a trip to Israel in the coming days but no travel has been finalised as its military is carrying out daily bombardments of the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza, according to a senior US administration official.
The trip would come amid growing fears that a looming Israeli move into Gaza could spark a wider war with devastating humanitarian consequences.   of Gaza has already killed more than 2,600 Palestinians.
And Biden's presence could be seen as a provocative move by Iran, or potentially viewed as tone-deaf by Arab nations as civilian casualties mount in Gaza.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has already been travelling around the Middle East this past week trying to prevent the war with Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, from igniting a broader regional conflict.
The official could not publicly discuss internal deliberations about the potential presidential travel and spoke on Sunday to The Associated Press news agency on condition of anonymity.
'Big mistake'
Biden also made his strongest public statements yet to restrain Israel after the October 7 attacks by Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people in southern Israel, including at least 30 US citizens, warning in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday that Israel should not reoccupy Gaza.
"I think it'd be a big mistake," Biden said. "Look, what happened in Gaza, in my view, is Hamas, and the extreme elements of Hamas don't represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again."
Israel left Gaza in 2005; Hamas won the elections the next year.
Still, Biden said, "taking out the extremists … is a necessary requirement".
Biden and his administration have refused to criticise Israel or its bombing campaign that has killed civilians in Gaza.
But they have urged Israel, Egypt and other nations to allow for humanitarian aid and supplies into the worsening conflict zone.
"I'm confident that Israel is going to act under the rules of war," Biden said in the interview.
"There's standards that democratic institutions and countries go by. And I'm confident that there's going to be an ability for the innocents in Gaza to be able to have access to medicine and food and water."
Blinken, meanwhile, heard criticism of Israel's military operation from Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. After Cairo, he travelled on to Jordan and planned to return to Israel on Monday, carrying to Israeli leaders the feedback he received in a rush of meetings with leaders throughout the Arab world.
Egypt's state-run media said el-Sisi told Blinken that Israel's Gaza operation has exceeded "the right of self-defence" and turned into "a collective punishment".
Blinken told reporters before leaving Egypt that "Israel has the right, indeed it has the obligation to defend itself against these attacks from Hamas and to try to do what it can to make sure that this never happens again".
Mindful of the potential human cost in Gaza, Blinken said, "The way that Israel does this matters. It needs to do it in a way that affirms the shared values that we have for human life and human dignity, taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians."
Earlier on Sunday, the envoy met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh for talks that built upon earlier sessions with the leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority.
Blinken said what he heard in every meeting with Arab leaders "was a determination of shared view that we have to do everything possible to make sure this doesn't spread to other places, a shared view to safeguard innocent lives, a shared view to get assistance to Palestinians in Gaza who need it and we're working very much on that".
'Basic principles'
The White House also appointed David Satterfield, a former ambassador to Lebanon and Turkey, to lead US efforts to get humanitarian assistance to "vulnerable people through the Middle East". Satterfield was expected to arrive in Israel on Monday.
From Washington, Biden's national security adviser said the US was not "making requests or demands of Israel with respect to its military operations".
Jake Sullivan, making the rounds of the Sunday TV news shows, said the administration was "simply stating our basic principles – the principles upon which this country is based and all democracies, including Israel, are based. It's what makes us different from the terrorists, that in fact, we respect civilian life."
He said the US was "not interfering in their military planning or trying to give them instructions or requests specific".
Sullivan said the US is conveying the message in public and in private that "all military operations should be conducted consistent with law of war, that civilians should be protected, that civilians should have a real opportunity to get to safety" and have access to food, water, medicine and shelter.
Those remarks marked a shift in the US administration's comments in recent days as officials have heard Arab leaders' concerns.
Those leaders expressed the consequences of what a humanitarian catastrophe resulting from an Israeli ground offensive would do not only to Palestinians but also in inflaming public opinions in Arab nations and potentially destabilising relatively friendly countries.
Sullivan also said the US has been unable so far to get American citizens out of Gaza through Egypt's Rafah crossing with Gaza.

Hezbollah fires on Israel after several members killed in shelling

The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has fired a barrage of rockets into Israel after at least three of its members were killed during an Israeli bombardment of   amid soaring tensions on Israel's northern border.
Hezbollah in a statement on Monday said it had fired rockets and mortars on two Israeli military posts in the Galilee. The Israeli military said it identified a number of "launches" from Lebanon into Israel, without any injuries. It said it was responding with artillery fire onto Lebanon.
Hezbollah, the most formidable member of a regional network of armed groups supported by Iran, confirmed in statements on Monday that Israeli shelling had killed at least three of its members.
The Associated Press news agency identified those killed as Hussam Mohammad Ibrahim, Ali Raef Ftouni, and Ali Hassan Hodroj.
Hezbollah said that those killed had been "martyred as a result of the Zionist aggression on south Lebanon Monday afternoon".
The Israeli military began shelling southern Lebanon on Monday after a cross-border raid claimed by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) armed group.
The Israeli army said soldiers backed by helicopters killed at least two gunmen who crossed the frontier.
Questions continue to loom about whether  , a sophisticated fighting force with an arsenal of long-range missiles, will enter the war between Israel and the armed wing of the Palestinian group Hamas, which governs the besieged Gaza Strip. Doing so would elevate the current conflict into a two-front war for Israel, long considered a nightmare scenario by the country's military establishment.
The Reuters news outlet reported that a spokesperson for the United Nations   along the Lebanon-Israel border said its head Major General Aroldo Lazaro was "in contact with the involved parties, urging them to exercise maximum restraint".
Hezbollah and Israel exchanged fire on Sunday, with Hezbollah   on Israeli positions in Shebaa Farms, which is claimed by Lebanon and was captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, in 'solidarity' with the Palestinians.
But the Iran-backed armed group has avoided deeper participation thus far, and denied involvement in the PIJ attack that took place on Monday. The Israeli military said its forces had "killed a number of armed suspects that infiltrated into Israeli territory from Lebanese territory", but did not offer a specific number.
Some experts have said that Hezbollah's position could change if Israel were to launch a   in Gaza that would likely have devastating impacts on the besieged and tightly-packed Strip, home to more than 2.3 million Palestinians.
Al Jazeera's Ali Hashem said the killing of Hezbollah fighters represents a 'real escalation' at the Lebanese border, noting that the group often retaliates for the killing of its members.
'This would mean that they could launch another attack in the coming hours,' he said. Hezbollah and Israel have not seen a major confrontation since the 2006 war.
The possibility of escalation between Israel and Hezbollah has also struck fear in residents of southern Lebanon, who have borne the brunt of previous Israeli offensives.
"Our house is really close to the border, so we're leaving and going down to the village,' Gabi Hage, a father of three who described nearby shelling, told Reuters. 'All my neighbours are doing the same."
Hamas launched a   on southern Israel on Saturday. At least 800 Israelis have been killed and thousands of others wounded, while the attack has shaken the confidence of the country, long accustomed to overwhelming military supremacy in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Images have circulated on social media of Israelis killed and kidnapped by Palestinian gunmen at military bases and towns throughout southern Israel.
Senior Israeli officials have promised to punish the Gaza Strip following the Hamas assault.
Israel formally declared war on Sunday and gave the green light for "significant military steps" against Hamas.
More than 500 Palestinians, including women and children, have been killed in Israeli air raids on Gaza since Saturday, with thousands of others wounded.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has ordered a 'total siege'  , cutting off access to food, water, fuel, and electricity.

Here is the situation on Thursday,  , 2023:
The latest developments
  being brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the United States are under way for a three-day   in exchange for the release of about a dozen captives in Gaza.
Al-Quds Hospital has run out of fuel and   its key operations on Wednesday.
An overnight Israeli bombardment on Jabalia refugee camp in the north and Sabra in western Gaza has killed dozens, based on reports from Al Jazeera Arabic and Palestinian news agency Wafa.
A   by the Washington Post has been taken down after it received outrage for dehumanising Palestinians. The publication's opinion editor said that the cartoon was "meant to caricature a specific Hamas spokesman".
A total of 106 aid trucks and ambulances entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing on Wednesday, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PCRS). The organisation has said that the supply still does not meet the enclave's needs.
Human impact and fighting
A Palestinian medical source told Al Jazeera early on Thursday that in the last 24 hours, the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza has recorded at least 65 deaths and more than 100 injuries from the continuing Israeli bombardment. A huge blast has been reported near al-Shifa Hospital in the early hours of Thursday, according to Reuters.
The Israeli military announced on Thursday that one of its soldiers had been killed in Gaza.
In northern Gaza, Hamas fighters are conducting 'hit-and-run attacks' against Israeli forces and will likely shift the focus of their military activity to the centre of Gaza City, according to Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War.
Late on Wednesday, Israel's intelligence agency said it   arrest two people who were involved in "terrorist" activity being planned by Hezbollah.
The Pentagon says it struck a weapon storage facility in eastern Syria on Wednesday that was   by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported that nine people linked to Iran-backed groups had been killed.
Israeli air attacks targeted military sites in southern Syria, according to Syrian state news agency SANA.
Diplomacy
Heads of state and United Nations officials are gathering in Paris on Thursday to discuss humanitarian aid for Gaza, according to the AP. On Wednesday, Amnesty International called on them to push for a ceasefire in their meeting.
At the   on Wednesday night, party nominees for the US presidency voiced their support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Foreign ministers who gathered at the G7 summit published a joint statement on Wednesday calling for a "humanitarian pause" in Gaza.
In a video statement on Wednesday, the deputy prime minister of Belgium said it is time to place sanctions on Israel. In an   with Al Jazeera, a Spanish minister also called on the international community to place sanctions on Israel.
British Foreign Minister James Cleverly arrived in Saudi Arabia on Thursday to try and find a resolution to the Israel-Gaza war. He will be holding talks with Middle East foreign ministers who are gathering in Saudi Arabia for an emergency meeting on Gaza this Saturday, according to the United Kingdom's foreign office.
Arrests and attacks in the occupied West Bank
On Wednesday night, a Palestinian man was fatally shot through the heart by Israeli forces in Tabaka village of Hebron, according to Al Jazeera correspondent Zein Basravi.
Israeli forces used four Israeli bulldozers to destroy streets in Jenin, Wafa reported early on Thursday.
Two Israeli settlers were shot in a settlement near Nablus, according to Basravi. Due to their critical condition, they had to be evacuated to a Tel Aviv hospital by helicopter.

Ex-Obama adviser Stuart Seldowitz arrested after Islamophobic rant

November 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A former high-ranking US government official has been arrested after being captured on video calling a halal food vendor in New York City a   and saying the death of 4,000 Palestinian children in Gaza "wasn't enough".
Stuart Seldowitz, 64, who previously served as deputy director of the US State Department's Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs, was arrested on Wednesday on charges of aggravated harassment, hate crime stalking, stalking causing fear, and stalking at a place of employment, New York police said in a statement.
"A 24-year-old male victim stated to police that an individual approached him at his work place multiple times and made anti-Islamic statements multiple times on different dates causing the victim to feel afraid and annoyed," police said.
Video went viral this month of multiple arguments over Israel's war on Gaza between Seldowitz and an Egyptian man working in a halal cart in Manhattan.
'If we killed 4,000 Palestinian kids, it wasn't enough," Seldowitz says in one exchange captured on video and posted on the social media platform X.
The vendor is seen telling Seldowitz to "go, go, go, go" and "I won't hear it". Seldowitz then responds: "But you're a terrorist. You support terrorism."

In other exchanges, Seldowitz is heard casting slurs against Prophet Muhammad, and calling the vendor 'ignorant" for his lack of fluency in English.
Seldowitz also threatens to use his government connections to mobilise Egypt's secret police against the vendor.
'The Mukhabarat [the intelligence agency] in Egypt will get your parents. Does your father like his fingernails? They'll take them out one by one," he says smiling.
'Not appropriate'
Seldowitz served as the acting director for the National Security Council South Asia Directorate under the former President Barack Obama administration. He also worked as a senior political officer in the State Department's Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs.
Seldowitz told local television news before his detention on Wednesday that the video posted on social media failed to tell the whole story and that he became upset after the man expressed sympathies for the Palestinian group Hamas – although none of the videos shows the vendor mentioning the group that rules Gaza.
"The comments that went beyond him [the vendor], and could be interpreted as attacks on Muslims and Arab-Americans and so on, were probably not appropriate," he told WNBC television. "The comments I made calling him out for his support of terrorism – those I think were appropriate."
After Seldowitz's actions went viral, New Yorkers rallied to support the vendor, lining up to buy chicken and rice at the food cart in Manhattan's Upper East Side neighbourhood on Tuesday.
The Street Vendor Project, which works with the thousands of food carts in New York, described a 'moving scene" with New Yorkers from 'all walks of life coming together" and 'taking a stand against anti-Muslim hate".

On October 7, Hamas launched an attack in Israel that killed 1,200 people. Israel has since bombarded the Gaza Strip, killing more than 14,500 Palestinians.
In the US, the war has prompted a surge in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and fuelled frequent street protests in support of both Israel and Palestine.
Asked about the incident by the Reuters news agency, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said: "The United States unequivocally opposes racist or discriminatory language of any form."

'Our hearts burn': Gaza's olive farmers say Israel war destroys harvest

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza Strip – Samaher Abu Jameh is angry.
The mother of two has worked as a farmer with her parents since her childhood in the town of Abasan al-Kabira in southern Gaza, close to the border with Israel. "My land has olive trees and greenhouses planted with tomatoes and livestock," she says.
She can no longer tend to those trees or tomatoes: The 40-year-old was displaced with her family and is living in a United Nations-run school in the centre of Khan Younis due to near-continuous Israeli bombing since October 7.
"I have no idea what state they are in. I just want to reach my land to see what has become of it," she says.
It's a sentiment echoed by farmers across Gaza.
The months of October and November, when  , hold special significance for Palestinians, who consider the harvest a national occasion that celebrates their relationship and connection with the land.
Farmers pick olives with their extended families and friends. Folk songs create a festive atmosphere. Meals are cooked and eaten under the trees. The olives are then pressed to extract olive oil, its quality depending on the climate and soil.
But with Israel's latest war on Gaza, which began on October 7 after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel, farmers have been forced away from their land and homes, and the ever-present risks that they already faced because of their proximity to the border with Israel have multiplied dramatically.
Samaher says that some farmers tried to go back to their lands but were targeted by Israeli warplanes.
"We are experiencing great suffering as farmers because these wars cost us greatly," she says. "We barely had time to catch our breath from the 2021 war before this started."
Dangerous farming
Even before the war, the olive-picking season had increasingly been marred by violence. In the occupied West Bank, Israeli settlers have been documented attacking Palestinians on their lands, stealing their olives and setting fire to their groves.  , a Palestinian olive farmer, was shot dead by a settler in October while harvesting his crop near Nablus.
In the Gaza Strip, the challenges come from the Israeli military, which either targets and bombs farmland during times of war or sprays it with pesticides, killing crops and rendering the soil unsuitable for farming.
Near the southern city of Khan Younis, the agricultural lands span an area of more than 4,000 hectares (9,884 acres) and lie east of the city around towns near the Israeli border fence: Khuza'a, Abasan al-Kabira, Abasan al-Jadida and Bani Suhaila. There are 7,000 farms in the Khan Younis governorate, according to the Ministry of Agriculture in the Gaza Strip.
Ahmed Abu Rjeila, 40, is accustomed to dodging bullets. "I used to go to my land in Abasan al-Jadida with my three brothers despite the dangers that we faced every day from the Israeli occupation, who would shoot at us in order to leave," he says.
Now, the risk is too high – even though the prospect of losing his harvest worries him. He and his family were displaced from their home at the beginning of the war, and have been staying at one of the UN schools in Khan Younis.
"I have hundreds of olive trees, and my family and friends were supposed to pick them and sell them in the market or press them in olive mill machines," he says. He also has seasonal crops in greenhouses. "I spent thousands of shekels on this season, and there will be no return on my investment if this war continues and my access to my land is denied."

Anger, heartbreak over loss of crops
Continuous bombing east of Khan Younis has resulted in the deaths of nearly 20 farmers and injuries to others, according to the Ministry of Agriculture in Gaza.
Over the past week, the Israeli army opened tank fire towards the agricultural lands east of the town of al-Fukhari, where farmers were trying to reach their lands to collect their crops and sell them in marketplaces.
Ahmed Qudeih, 37, is from the town of Khuza'a and owns 0.6 hectares (1.5 acres) of land. He says all the farmers have been forced from their homes and are now staying in different areas of the Khan Younis city centre.
"We are heartbroken over our crops, which we cannot reach," he says. "We can't irrigate or observe our land or take care of it. After every devastating war, we pay thousands of shekels to ensure the quality of our crops and to make our soil suitable again for agriculture."

Being a farmer on a normal day in Gaza can be a life-threatening vocation, he says, adding that Israeli forces have got "creative in destroying farmers' businesses" by inflicting human, material and economic losses.
"Over the past years, the land that I cultivate has been subjected to various types of violations from Israeli soldiers," he says. "I have been exposed several times to gunfire. The army has also bulldozed the land and sprayed the crops with pesticides to destroy them.
"This caused me huge financial losses, but after each round of destruction, I return to prepare the land for cultivation again."
Season over for olive oil production

Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture determined that the area of land planted with olive trees in the Gaza Strip was about 4,400 hectares (10,800 acres) and estimated that they could produce 35,000 tonnes of olives.
A small portion, about 9 percent (9,000 to 10,000 tonnes), is pickled in homes or factories, but the majority is sent to olive mill presses to transform it into oil. There are about 40 olive oil extraction presses, of which 32 are equipped with modern automatic equipment, six are semi-automatic and two operate manually on old stone mills.
Fayyad Fayyad, the director of the Palestinian Olive Council, says the annual average olive production season in Palestine is estimated at 100,000 tonnes, which yields up to 20,000 tonnes of olive oil.
'This year's olive season bears the name 'sheltoni', which means that the olive crop is small and not plentiful," he says. "For olive trees, it is usual to experience one year with an abundant crop and the following year with a smaller one.
"Last year, the season was abundant and witnessed the production of 36,000 tonnes in the Gaza Strip. Had it not been for the war, this season would have produced 10,000 tonnes of olives, or the equivalent of 2,000 tonnes of olive oil."
Many farmers have resigned themselves to the reality that this harvest season is over, saying that neither their homes nor lands have remained intact.
Still, the farmers are clear that they will regenerate their lands after every war, even as one as devastating as the current offensive, which so far has  .
"Our hearts burn over our lands," Nisreen Abu Daqqa from Khuza'a says. "We wait all year long for the olive season, which is the most beautiful season, but the Israelis have deliberately burned our trees using their missiles and tank shells."

Thousands of Gaza residents take refuge in UN schools from Israel air raids

Since the Israeli raids on the Gaza Strip began on Saturday, more than 73,000 Palestinian residents living along the eastern regions near the Israeli frontier have left their homes to take shelter in United Nations refugee agency schools.
According to Adnan Abu Hasna, a media spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), people are arriving from all parts of the Gaza Strip, as the area faces intense aerial bombardment.
"Residents have taken refuge in 64 schools, with more coming, as they believe that they are the safest places in the Gaza Strip because they are affiliated with the United Nations,' Abu Hasna said.
At the schools and other UN institutions in Gaza, Abu Hasna explained, Palestinians can receive healthcare, nutritional and psychological services.
"Some of the elderly are medical cases that need follow-up in light of the current tension, and children need psychological and social counsellors in order to overcome this difficult stage they have lived through," he said.
Families in Gaza are fleeing to the UNRWA schools after an unprecedented attack by Hamas fighters caught the Israeli military establishment by surprise. Members of Hamas's armed wing flew into Israeli military sites and towns using motorised paragliders, while others broke through the Israeli fence.
The Israeli government subsequently declared war on Gaza on Sunday. About 800 Israelis have been killed, with more than 2,000 others wounded. On Monday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said a total siege will be imposed on Gaza, with no food, electricity, water or fuel allowed in.
"We are fighting against human animals, and we are acting accordingly," Gallant said in his remarks.
According to the Israeli army, 100,000 reserve troops have amassed near Gaza, where Palestinian fighters say they are holding 130 people captive.
Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed more than 500 Palestinians, including 91 children.
Arifa Abu Laila, from the northern town of Beit Hanoun, said she left her home and is now taking refuge in an UNRWA school in the centre of Gaza City.
'We went out and saw explosions from all sides," the 51-year-old said. "I am a sick woman who needs treatment, and my husband is also diabetic. In every war, we come to UNRWA schools because they say it is safe."
The war was a surprise to everyone, she added.
"If we had known what would happen, we would have bought the supplies we needed, such as food, treatment and supplies. We had to walk to the schools barefoot, without provisions such as milk and diapers for our children."
Trying to escape death

It is not the first time that Palestinians have taken refuge in UNRWA schools during Israeli offensives. In recent years, Gaza residents have sought shelter  in the facilities amid aerial bombardments and other attacks.
But while the schools are part of UNRWA's emergency response programme, they are not   during times of war.
In a statement, UNRWA said two of its schools — one in the Jabalia refugee camp in the north and another in central Gaza City — had sustained damages from air attacks by Israeli forces.
"Two UNRWA schools were bombed," UNRWA spokesman Abu Hasna said, noting that 14 UN facilities in total have been damaged by the Israeli aerial raids so far.
"We have 200 UNRWA facilities located between residential areas and surrounded by various institutions. During the bombing, 14 facilities were subjected to various damages."
With the schools being struck by bombing, Abu Hasna said he feared safety would remain elusive, even at UN sites.
"We faced this event in the 2014 war," he added, pointing to a past incident when UN schools were hit by missile fire. "One of the schools was bombed, resulting in injuries, and this means that there is no safe place in Gaza.'
One grandmother, Etemad Salem, left her house in the Shujaiya camp with her family at night, screaming from the intensity of the bombing.
"I felt that it was an earthquake or that it was the day of judgement," the 70-year-old said, describing the bombing as "terrifying".
Salem's home was bombed in the last Israeli offensive, and her children said they had no choice but to leave and seek refuge at an UNRWA school.
"We came here to escape death," she said.
The school is a far cry from the comforts of a home, though. Salem, who suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, is unable to rest. "The explosions have not stopped, and here we cannot sleep either,' she said.
Salem ultimately does not know how long she and her children will be able to stay in the shelter.
"This is a safe place, but it is not suitable for living in for more than two days," she said. "There are many people here. There are two families with me in the classroom, and the men are sleeping in the hallways."

Saleh Al-Attar, 60, left his house in the town of Beit Lahia without knowing whether he would still have a home to come back to.
'I was sitting with my wife watching the news about the events on the Israeli areas surrounding Gaza," he told Al Jazeera.
"Within moments, the Israeli raids started, and the women in the house began screaming, so I decided to leave the house to the UNRWA school in the city centre, hoping it would be safe. There is no alternative option to this."
Al-Attar pointed to whole households that have been killed just sitting in their homes, ticking off their names: the Shabat family, the Abu Quta family and many more.
"We have no international protection," he said. "No one cares about our lives. Therefore, when Israel decides to exterminate the people in Gaza, no one stops it."
He doesn't know how long he will be displaced from his home, but he said he has become accustomed to "this repeated pain".
"How many wars have I lived through, and how many times have I been displaced to UNRWA schools? It is the fifth time since 2008," he said.
'Not a replacement home'

For Palestinian child Aseel Khaled, a school is supposed to be just an educational institution, not a replacement for a home.
"School is meant to be a place for study only," she said.
The 12-year-old woke up in the middle of the night on Saturday to sounds of heavy bombardment. Thinking her parents and sisters were killed, she began to scream.
"My mother tried to calm me and to reassure me that the Israelis wouldn't bomb our house," she said. "But the next morning we came to the New Gaza School which is affiliated with UNRWA."
The Israelis have bomb shelters they can hide in, Khaled said, but Palestinians in Gaza can only look to the schools as places of shelter.
"Here, we see our mothers' tears and hear the children and babies crying either from the constant state of panic or from the sound of missiles," Khaled said. "I try to keep busy during the day, but a lot of the time, I stay in the classroom with my mother because the school playground is not safe. I keep hearing and seeing repeated explosions.'

Biden arrives in Tel Aviv, backs Israel's narrative on Gaza hospital attack

US President Joe Biden has arrived in Israel for a diplomatic scramble to prevent the Gaza war from spiralling into an even larger conflict, a challenge that became more difficult as outrage swept through the Middle East over an explosion that killed hundreds in a Gaza Strip hospital on Tuesday.
Descending from the plane amid a large security contingent on Wednesday, Biden embraced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog on the tarmac at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv.
"Welcome, Mr President. God bless you for protecting the nation of Israel," Herzog's office quoted him as telling Biden.
Hundreds of armed police and troops were stationed around the seafront Tel Aviv hotel where Netanyahu and Biden hold talks, with snipers on the roofs of nearby villas.
US green light
Speaking at a news conference alongside Netanyahu, Biden said: "I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion of the hospital in Gaza yesterday, and based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you."
"But there's a lot of people out there not sure, so we've got a lot, we've got to overcome a lot of things,"Bidenadded.
"The world is looking. Israel has a value set like the United States does, and other democracies, and they are looking to see what we are going to do."
Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Tel Aviv, said Biden was giving Israel the green light to act as it sees fit.
"When the Americans said that their national security team would investigate the cause of the Gaza hospital explosion on Tuesday night, many thought there will be an extensive inquiry," he said.
"But it appears that President Biden has already decided who is behind the deadly attack, expressing, in poorly chosen words, that the 'other team' was responsible."
"This visit is a significant display of support for the Israelis. By asserting that a misfiring rocket caused the hospital carnage, Biden has effectively given Israel the green light to act as it sees fit."
Biden was originally scheduled to visit Jordan as well, but his meetings with Arab leaders were called off as he was leaving Washington on Tuesday evening, costing him an opportunity for the face-to-face conversations that he views as crucial for navigating this fraught moment.
Israel has been preparing for a potential ground invasion of Gaza in response to the deadly October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, the armed group that rules the Palestinian enclave. The violence in Israel killed at least 1,400 people, mostly Israelis.
About 3,300 Palestinians have been reported killed in Israel's retaliatory air raids on Gaza. Another 1,200 people are believed to be buried under the rubble, alive or dead, health authorities said.
Those numbers predate the explosion at al-Ahli Arab Hospital on Tuesday. No clear cause has been established for the blast.
Gaza's Health Ministry said an Israeli air raid caused the destruction. The Israeli military denied involvement and blamed a misfired rocket from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another armed group. However, that organisation also rejected responsibility.
Protests swept through the region after the deaths at the hospital, which had been treating wounded Palestinians and sheltering many more who were seeking refuge from the fighting.
Hundreds of protesters flooded the streets of key West Bank cities, including Ramallah. More people joined protests that erupted in Beirut, Lebanon and Amman, Jordan, where an angry crowd gathered outside the Israeli embassy.
Outrage over the hospital explosion scuttled Biden's plans to visit Jordan, where King Abdullah II had planned to host meetings with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. But Abbas withdrew in protest, and the summit was subsequently cancelled outright.
Ayman Safadi, Jordan's foreign minister, told a state-run television network that the Gaza war is "pushing the region to the brink".

Humatarian aid stuck at Gaza border as WHO warns of 'catastrophe'

Egyptian authorities have   that Israel is not cooperating with efforts to deliver much-needed humanitarian aid into the besieged Gaza Strip, where Israeli air strikes have killed thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands of others.
Cairo said on Monday that the  , the sole remaining exit out of Gaza, has been rendered nearly inoperable by continuous  , with hundreds of tonnes of aid stalled on the Egyptian side.
"There is an urgent need to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza," Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told reporters, adding that talks with Israel have not been productive.
"Until now the Israeli government has not taken a position on opening the Rafah crossing from the Gaza side to allow the entrance of assistance and exit of citizens of third countries."
(Al Jazeera)
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that "there is currently no ceasefire and humanitarian aid in Gaza in return for removing foreigners".
The dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached new heights, with Israel   access to food, water, fuel and electricity for the besieged enclave's 2.3 million residents and unleashing a barrage of air strikes that Palestinian authorities say have killed more than 2,800 people and injured more than 10,000.
The United States has voiced its support for an arrangement that would allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, as rights groups and medical organisations plead for reprieve amid rapidly  .
The United Nations humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths has said that he will travel to the Middle East on Tuesday for negotiations over aid to Gaza, adding that he hoped for 'good news' later on Monday.
Griffiths also urged the Palestinian armed group Hamas, which governs the coastal enclave, to release the more than 100 people it took captive during a   on southern Israel on October 7 'straight away'. That attack killed at least 1,400 people, Israeli authorities say, many of them civilians.
The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Monday afternoon that there were only "24 hours of water, electricity and fuel left" in the Gaza Strip before "a real catastrophe" sets in.
Israel has thus far shown little interest in letting in aid.
'I strongly oppose the opening of the blockade and the introduction of goods into Gaza on humanitarian grounds,' Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said in a social media post earlier on Monday.
'Our commitment is to the families of the murdered and the kidnapped hostages - not to the Hamas murderers and those who helped them,' Katz added.
Israel has declared war against Hamas and is expected to launch a   of Gaza, with the aim of destroying the Palestinian group.
But in Gaza, there is nowhere for Palestinians to flee the onslaught, and Israel   the entire population of northern Gaza — more than one million people — to evacuate south, an order that the UN has said could create a humanitarian catastrophe.
Many Palestinians   that the evacuation could turn into permanent exile, as happened during the 1948 Nakba when Israeli forces expelled hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes and barred them from returning.

What does Gaza's food shortage look like?

October 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza's population is going hungry as people in the besieged strip face a dire humanitarian situation.
Shortages of medical supplies, food, drinking water and electricity have left 2.3 million Gaza Palestinians at risk of starvation and disease following Israel's total blockade of the Gaza Strip in the wake of attacks by Hamas on October 7.
'Gaza is struggling with a lack of basic supplies. Food and water are running out. People are facing increasingly desperate conditions,' says Abeer Etefa, a World Food Programme (WFP) spokesperson. 'Outside Gaza, conditions in the West Bank are decreasing every day.'
How much aid has entered Gaza?
So far, only 84 trucks of aid have crossed into Gaza through Rafah since October 21, due to the crossing being closed after the start of the conflict, as Israel repeatedly bombed it.
PRCS teams received 10 trucks loaded with humanitarian aid through the Rafah crossing today. Six trucks of them was delivered to the ICRC which were sent to them, and four trucks from the Egyptian Red Crescent to the Palestine Red Crescent.

- PRCS (@PalestineRCS) October 27, 2023
Prior to October 7, nearly 500 trucks of aid were delivered to people in the besieged enclave daily.
The aid entering now does not include fuel, which was banned by Israel, needed to power hospitals, water and sewage works, and generate electricity.
'People are going to starve unless they get humanitarian assistance now. We need many, many, many more trucks and a continual flow of aid,' Cindy McCain, executive director of the WFP said.
How much aid needs to enter Gaza?
The WFP has said 141 tonnes of food supplies, including canned fish and sunflower oil, have crossed into Gaza on those 74 trucks since the opening of the Rafah crossing on October 21.
In order for aid to reach the 1.1 million Palestinians who were told by Israel to evacuate from the north of Gaza to the south, operations need to be scaled up with at least 40 trucks carrying food supplies into Gaza daily, the WFP has said.
What provisions are in place by the World Food Programme?
For every person who has received WFP food assistance, at least six more are in need.
There are 40 WFP trucks loaded and ready near the Egyptian border with Gaza and another 930 tonnes of food stockpiled.
The food on the trucks includes canned fish and food parcels containing pasta, wheat flour, canned tomato paste and canned beans.
The WFP has provided emergency food and cash assistance to more than 628,500 people across Gaza and the West Bank.
Of these beneficiaries, about 475,000 displaced people in UN-designated shelters received canned tuna, and fresh bread through WFP-contracted bakeries.
Overall, close to a quarter of a million people in Gaza have redeemed this voucher assistance in shops since October 7.
The bread supply in Gaza is running short due to a lack of fuel and electricity. Of the five flour mills in the Gaza Strip, only one mill is operating.
The WFP was relying on 23 bakeries to feed 220,000 people a day. Today, only two bakeries are able to work. They are producing at six times their normal capacity.
The situation before the blockade
Before the Hamas attack on October 7, nearly one-third of the population of Palestine - 33.6 percent, or 1.84 million people - was food insecure, according to the WFP.
Food insecurity is particularly high among women, particularly in the Gaza Strip, where 63.3 percent of female-headed households suffer food insecurity.
After the October 7 attacks, Israel cut off its water pipeline to Gaza - along with the fuel and electricity provisions that power water and sewage plants.
United Nations agencies have warned the collapse of water and sanitation services will spark bouts of cholera and other deadly infectious diseases if urgent humanitarian aid is not delivered.

Four tombs unearthed at Roman-era cemetery in Gaza

Gaza City, Palestine – The discovery of four Roman-era tombs in the Gaza Strip indicates the long history of settlement, agriculture, industry and trade in Gaza, according to a Palestinian archaeologist.
Four tombs dating back 2,000 years were discovered at a Roman-era cemetery in the Gaza Strip on Saturday.
'Field research efforts are still ongoing within the Roman cemetery, with the involvement of Palestinian experts and the participation of French archaeologists,' Jamal Abu Reida, the Director-General of Antiquities at the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, told Al Jazeera.
'The ongoing work is part of the long journey to uncover historical and archaeological discoveries, which have been found in various areas of the Gaza Strip in recent years,' he added.
The discovery of the four tombs brought the total number of unearthed graves at the archaeological site, which is spread over an area of nearly 4,000 square meters (43,000 square feet), to 134, the Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism in the Gaza Strip announced on Saturday.

Palestinian archaeologist, Fadel al-Otol, said that the cemetery is currently undergoing a process of study, restoration and maintenance, with the aim of eventually opening it to visitors and researchers.
Al-Otol confirmed the remarkable discovery of two lead coffins, one intricately engraved with grape harvest motifs, and the other featuring dolphins swimming in water.

Some of the graves are distinguished by pyramid designs, and fragments of pottery and metal pieces used in funeral rituals have also been found.
Al-Otol who leads a team of technicians and engineers called Intiqal, emphasised the importance of actively seeking additional discoveries, considering Gaza's status as a city with a profoundly rich heritage that encompasses antiquities from diverse eras and civilizations.
He also expressed his deep regret over the lack of financial resources that are hindering the continuation of excavation work at other archaeological sites in the Palestinian enclave, which has been under an Israeli land, sea and air blockade for more than 15 years.

"Gaza holds a place of historical significance as one of the world's oldest cities for its strategic geographical location at the intersection of the Asian and African continents," he told Al Jazeera.
Al-Otol lamented the lack of resources for the maintenance of antiquities amid the difficult living conditions in the enclave – home to two million people. The excavation and restoration work is funded by the British Council's Fund for the Protection of Culture.

"These archaeological findings show the historical roots and Palestinian heritage, which extend over thousands of years, debunking all narratives propagated by the Israeli occupation that portray Palestine as a land without a people and a people without a land," al-Otal said.
Last December, the 2,000-year-old Roman cemetery was discovered while Egyptian bulldozers were working on the construction of the Egyptian city as part of the reconstruction plans in the northwest of the Gaza Strip.

This significant discovery, confirmed by a French nongovernmental organisation, revealed that the cemetery had been buried for centuries beneath Gaza's soil and dates back to the ancient Roman era, spanning between the first and second centuries AD. The coffins within the cemetery were adorned with intricate paintings and laurel leaf wreaths.
The revelation of the Roman cemetery followed another archaeological find made three months ago, when mosaic floors dating back to the Byzantine era, approximately 1,800 years old, were discovered within agricultural land east of the Bureij refugee camp, situated in the central part of the Gaza Strip.
Gaza has been grappling with severe poverty – more than 80 percent of the people are dependent on aid. The Israeli blockade has significantly restricted the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza, contributing to the challenging humanitarian situation in the Strip.

Biden's Israel trip reveals 'performative' approach to Gaza war: analysts

October 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - Asthe   nears the end of its second week, analysts say United States President Joe Biden is increasingly acting like a wartime leader, offering a "performative" show of strength and support for Israel.
Biden visited Israel on Wednesday to back its military campaign in Gaza despite growing calls for a ceasefire.
"I'm here to tell you that terrorists will not win. Freedom will win," Biden said in remarks reminiscent of the speeches former President George W Bush gave after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.
Experts say Biden is attempting to appeal to his domestic audience ahead of the 2024 elections and dodge Republican criticisms that would frame him as "weak".
George Bisharat, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco, said Biden's approach to the Gaza war — including the visit to Israel — has an 'element of political performance'.
'This is 'Sleepy Joe' proving that he's awake, that he's an expert on foreign policy,' Bisharat told Al Jazeera, invoking former President   nickname for Biden.
'Of course, most of the time, American voters don't really care very much about foreign policy; they don't vote on foreign policy grounds. But wartime is an exception. This, in a way, is an opportunity to kind of flex muscles without the actual concrete costs to American soldiers in particular.'
The conflict in Gaza began on October 7, when Hamas issued a   against Israel from the besieged Palestinian territory, killing more than 1,300 people and taking dozens captive.
Israel responded with a declaration of war the following day. It has since led a continuous bombing campaign that has killed at least 3,785 Palestinians, including hundreds of children in Gaza.
Analysts say Biden's vocal solidarity with Israel also stems from his personal affinity for the US ally. The president is a self-described Zionist and a   of Israel.
But Biden's decision to back Israel's military campaign in Gaza has raised questions over previous pledges he made to centre human rights in his foreign policy agenda.
'Theatre' of war
Washington has sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region in   a wider conflict, should forces like Iran and theLebanese armed group Hezbollah consider intervention.
The US president also said in an interview with CBS News last week that Hamas must be eliminated, pledging to provide Israel with the military aid it needs to carry out its war.
Experts say an Israeli ground invasion to uproot Hamas from Gaza would come at an enormous cost for all the parties involved, especially  .
And while it may be technically possible to defeat Hamas's military wing, it is much more difficult to extinguish the group's political movement.
"What does this entail? How would you actually destroy Hamas? Can you?" said Osamah Khalil, a history professor at Syracuse University, casting doubt over the prospect.
Khalil explained that door-to-door fighting in Gaza's dense urban areas would not be easy for Israel, were it to attack Hamas with a ground invasion.
As analogies, he pointed to the setbacks Israel faced in Lebanon during its 2006 ground offensive, as well as the slow progress   has made in Ukraine since its invasion in 2022.
"You can see what Russia is having to deal with in Ukraine, and they have a much bigger military," he said.
William Astore, a historian and retired lieutenant colonel in the US Air Force, also highlighted the challenges of destroying the Palestinian group.
"You can reduce Hamas. You can kill as many soldiers as you can find, I suppose," Astore told Al Jazeera.
"The question always is at what price? And no, you can't you can't kill off Hamas because Hamas is more of an ideology. It's not only a military force."
So where does that leave the US policy of open-ended support for Israel?
For Khalil, there needs to be an "off-ramp" to stop the fighting, but he said in the immediate future — with Biden's endorsement — the bombardment of Gaza is set to continue.
Analysts like Khalil stress that US foreign policy cannot be separated from its politics at home. Biden is already facing Republican accusations of being too  , Hamas's ally.
So the White House has been pushing to reclaim the narrative and position Biden as a champion of Israel in its time of need.
Publicly released photos show Biden meeting with his top security aides to discuss the conflict, including in the Situation Room, an intelligence centre at the White House.
. @VP  and I sat down with our teams to receive a situation update on the terrorist attack in Israel and to direct next steps.
We connected with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss coordination to support Israel, deter hostile actors, and protect innocent people. pic.twitter.com/u4xOHMeMqw
- President Biden (@POTUS) October 10, 2023
"If you're going to frame your reelection   as a foreign policy aspect and then 'the war and terrorism and supporting and saving Israel', then you're going to want to show this active, vital president who's making decisions and is in full-on commander-in-chief mode," Khalil said.
Astore, the historian, echoed that take.
"It's theatre. I would say the primary audience is domestic, here in the United States," Astore said.
"We know obviously that President Biden faces reelection next year and that his opponent may be  . So what Biden is attempting to do is to show that Israel has no better friend than Joe Biden and the Democratic Party."
No ceasefire
Regardless of Biden's calculus, advocates say his refusal to call for a ceasefire is a sign of leadership failure. On Wednesday, Washington   a Security Council proposal that would have called for a humanitarian pause to the war.
Phyllis Bennis, director of the New Internationalism Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, characterised Biden's recent visit to Israel as a lost opportunity.
"Any visit that did not include a public call for a ceasefire essentially amounts to an endorsement of the continuing Israeli attacks on Gaza," she said.
Bennis added that the US president's "bear-hug diplomacy" with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu makes his vague references to international law fall flat.
"You don't live by the rules of terrorists. You live by the rule of law. And when conflicts flare, you live by the law of wars," Biden told Israelis in an address on Wednesday.
A day later, United Nations experts warned that by cutting off water to Gaza and targeting civilian infrastructure, Israel is violating international law.
"We are sounding the alarm: There is an ongoing campaign by Israel resulting in crimes against humanity in Gaza," the experts  said.
"Considering statements made by Israeli political leaders and their allies, accompanied by military action in Gaza and escalation of arrests and killing in the West Bank, there is also a risk of genocide against the Palestine people."
But Biden has sought to distance the current war from the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict, avoiding public remarks on the history of violence and displacement Palestinians have faced. Rights groups like Amnesty International have accused Israel of   on Palestinians.
And while in Israel, Biden pledged to push forward with efforts to establish ties between Israel and Arab states independently of the Palestinian file.
"I think US policy is to support at the moment whatever Israel is trying to accomplish, however realistic or unrealistic that may be," Bennis told Al Jazeera.

A billionaire real estate tycoon in the United States is rallying support for a high-dollar media crusade to boost Israel's image and demonise the Hamas armed group amid global pro-Palestinian solidarity protests.
The media campaign — called Facts for Peace — is seeking million-dollar donations from dozens of the world's biggest names in media, finance and technology, according to an email seen by news website Semafor .
More than 50 individuals are being courted including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Dell CEO Michael Dell and financier Michael Milken. They have a combined net worth of around $500bn, Semafor said.
'Get ahead of the narrative'
US billionaire Barry Sternlicht, who started the project, said the campaign would help Israel 'get ahead of the narrative' as the world has reacted to the intensive Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip.
"Public opinion will surely shift as scenes, real or fabricated by Hamas, of civilian Palestinian suffering will surely erode [Israel's] current empathy in the world community", Sternlicht wrote in an email soliciting contributions from the wealthy figures shortly after Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel, according to Semafor. "We must get ahead of the narrative."
Israel has carried out relentless air strikes on the besieged Gaza Strip since October 7,  at least 11,078 Palestinian people, including 4,500 children,  1.5 million people, and wrecking much of the territory's infrastructure, Gaza officials say.
Hamas's surprise attack on Israeli territory on October 7 killed some 1,200 Israelis, according to Israeli officials.
Sternlicht's media drive aims to brand Hamas as a 'terrorist organisation' that is 'not just the enemy of Israel, but of the United States', he wrote. The goal is to draw $50m in private donations, paired with a matching contribution from a Jewish charity. Hamas is already designated as a "terrorist" organisation by the US and the European Union for its armed resistance against Israeli occupation.
It is unclear which figures have donated, but the campaign has raised at least a few million dollars already, Semafor reported, citing 'people familiar with the matter'.
It is being advised by Josh Vlasto, a communications strategist who previously worked for US Senator Chuck Schumer and former Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo, Semafor reported.
The US is Israel's strongest global ally, providing it with billions of dollars of aid annually and staunch diplomatic backing. Despite the mounting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the US government has continuously rebuffed global calls for a ceasefire and reiterated that Washington will not give Israel 'red lines' in the war. On November 2, the US Congress   a $14.3bn emergency military aid package for Israel.
However, public support for the US's position appears to be ebbing, with nearly half of US Democrats disapproving of how Joe Biden has handled the conflict, according to a recent poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Social media giants such as Instagram, X, YouTube and TikTok have been   by reducing their reach, a practice known as shadowbanning.
Axios reported last month that pro-Palestine posts on TikTok were being viewed four times more than pro-Israel posts. This came as people around the world have reacted with horror to the mounting death toll in Gaza where most of the killed are civilians.
Facts For Peace, the media campaign launched by Sternlicht, aims to win back public favour for Israel, posting videos on its social media pages blaming Hamas for the plight of Palestinians and denying claims of Israeli rights violations.
The most recent video posted on its Facebook page argues that 'Israel is not an apartheid state".
This contradicts findings from Palestinian, Israeli and international rights experts, including from the United Nations, that Israel is practising apartheid through its "deeply discriminatory dual legal and political system" in the occupied territories.
Israel occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza in the 1967 war and later annexed East Jerusalem. It withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005 but continues to maintain a siege on the territory of 2.3 million people. Israel has continued to expand settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem – a step considered illegal under international law.
Settlements pose the biggest hurdles in the realisation of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state living side-by-side with Israel, experts say. The US has condemned the settlements' expansions but done little to stop its closest ally.

Bolivia has cut official ties with Israel over the war in Gaza as two other Latin American countries recalled their ambassadors in Tel Aviv for consultations.
Bolivia "decided to break diplomatic relations with the Israeli state in repudiation and condemnation of the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in the Gaza Strip," Deputy Foreign Minister Freddy Mamani said at a press conference on Tuesday night.
Minister of the Presidency Maria Nela Prada also announced the country would send humanitarian aid to Gaza.
"We demand an end to the attacks" in the Gaza Strip "which have so far caused thousands of civilian deaths and the forced displacement of Palestinians," she said at the same press conference.
Neighbours Colombia and Chile also recalled their ambassadors for consultations condemning the deaths of civilians in Gaza and calling for a ceasefire.
 , Latin America's left-leaning countries have sympathised with the Palestinian cause, while the more right-wing countries have tended to follow the lead of the United States.
Writing on social media site X, Chilean President Gabriel Boric accused Israel of "unacceptable violations of International Humanitarian Law" and following a policy of "collective punishment" of the people of Gaza, as he announced the recall of Ambassador Jorge Carvajal.
Chile has the largest, and one of the oldest,   outside the Arab world.
Also writing on X, Colombian President Gustavo Petro called the attacks a "massacre of the Palestinian people".
Other Latin American countries, including Mexico and Brazil, have also called for a ceasefire.
Bolivia is among the first nations to announce the end of diplomatic relations with Israel over its war in Gaza, which came after armed group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel killing 1,400 people and taking some 240 people captive. At least 13 citizens from several Latin American countries were among the dead, and some 21 more remain missing.
At least 8,525 Palestinians have now been killed in   in Gaza.
Hamas welcomed Bolivia's decision and urged Arab countries that have normalised their relations with Tel Aviv to do the same.
Bolivia previously   with Israel in 2009, also in protest against Israel's actions in Gaza.
Relations were only restored in 2020.
About 2.3 million people live in Gaza and United Nations officials say more than 1.4 million of them have been made homeless by Israel's relentless bombardment.

'Like a prison': The Palestinians in Hebron living under Israeli lockdown

November 5th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Hebron, occupied West Bank – Across the neighbourhoods of the H2 area of Hebron – the 20 percent of the Palestinian city where some 700 Israelis live in illegal settlements and the Israeli military has full control – the streets are mostly empty of H2's approximately 35,000 Palestinian residents.
Patrolling the streets and manning the rooftops, instead, are Israeli soldiers and armed settlers in military uniform on the lookout for any movement from Palestinian homes. Besieged, Palestinian families describe conditions in which they are attacked, deprived of vital supplies and services, and have had their livelihoods cut off.
'This has never happened before where a full lockdown is implemented, even during the second Intifada,' said Bassam Abu Aisha, 61, vice president of a local drivers' union and former president of the popular committee for Tel Rumeida, a hill and neighbourhood in the H2 area. '[Back then] we would have the liberty to go buy things and be in the street. But now no one can do that.'
Several residents who spoke to Al Jazeera said the same thing: 'It's like we are in a prison.'
Soldiers by day, settlers by night
Following the shocking October 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas, Israeli soldiers came without warning to Palestinian shops in Hebron and ordered their owners and workers at gunpoint to close shop and stay home.
In online community chat groups, word trickled across the neighbourhoods of H2: Any Palestinians found outside their homes would be shot.

Palestinians in H2 were completely unable to leave their homes for the first four days, living off whatever supplies they already had. Now, they can only leave their homes and cross checkpoints at a designated hour in the morning and an hour in the evening on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Residents also describe a flurry of attacks and threats that began immediately after October 7. Local activist Issa Amro, 43, was apprehended by soldiers and settlers dressed in military uniform, telling him he was under arrest.
Amro explained over the phone that he was taken to the military base in Tel Rumeida. Cuffed and tightly blindfolded, Amro said he was beaten and spat at for hours, with settlers shouting slurs at him. After 10 hours, they let him go.
Over the next few days, Amro said settlers in military uniform attacked his home, stealing his house keys at one point. On October 20, soldiers forced Amro from his home, declaring it a 'closed military zone', insisting it was for his 'protection'. Amro, who is now staying with friends in the H1 area, has not been able to return to his home and is still recovering from injuries to his back, legs and hands.
'This is my first live experience to be tortured,' said a shaken Amro.

With regular military forces moved to Gaza and the Lebanese border, the city's reserve battalion has taken on primary security responsibility in H2 as well as much of Area C, the 60 percent of the West Bank under full Israeli military control.
'During the day they are soldiers, and at night they are settlers,' said Emad Hamdan, executive director of Hebron Rehabilitation Committee (HRC), a Palestinian NGO based in the Old City of Hebron. 'So they have the same attitude.'
Palestinian residents say soldiers aim guns at anyone who goes up to their roof or even peers through their window, shouting at them to stay inside.
When they do go outside during the allotted time, residents still risk attacks and threats from settlers, who now wear military uniforms.
'The settlers try to touch our women and daughters," said Abu Aisha. "They hit us; they say all kinds of horrible words in order to provoke a reaction so they have an excuse to murder us.'
In one confrontation on the street, a reserve soldier – a local settler and paramedic who Abu Aisha has encountered before – was cocking his gun as if to shoot Abu Aisha. A video recorded by a neighbour shows the man fumbling to put a bullet into the gun before it drops to the ground.

'The children are constantly afraid'
While the military recently began allowing students to walk outside and cross checkpoints for an hour in the morning and another hour in the afternoon during the school week, parents are not allowed to accompany their children. As a result, children have largely been unable to go to school, due to both the movement restrictions and because their parents fear attacks from armed settlers.
A woman from the Jabari family, who resides in Wadi Hussein, a stretch of Palestinian land in H2 that lies between the Israeli settlements of Givat Hava'ot and Kiryat Arba – where Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir lives – said the 11 children in the family compound are growing restless. They wish they could go to school or at least to a shop to buy sweets, she said.
While some families have tried online learning, the internet connection has been too poor for lessons, she added.
The Jabari family say they have been targeted by settlers for years. Among other violent incidents, a family member had been attacked with an iron pole, leaving him with severe head injuries, a female family member told Al Jazeera.
The community believes that settlers see the Jabari home as key to ultimately dismantling the Palestinian neighbourhood and connecting the two settlements.

The Jabaris say that other than to get food, they have been unable to go out since settlers recently placed couches across from their home, where they sit in wait.
The woman from the family, who did not wish to be identified, said that while they try to tell the children not to worry, they 'know something dangerous is happening here'.
In one instance, a child in the family was chased down the street by a settler, she said. Another time, a five-year-old girl in the family saw a settler on the street and immediately ran in fear, falling and injuring herself.
'The children are constantly afraid,' the family member said. 'They live in fear.'
For weeks, soldiers have prevented families from bringing in gas tanks for cooking and heating from H1 (the area of Hebron under the Palestinian Authority) into H2. Following lobbying from local and international organisations, the military recently agreed to allow gas tanks in under supervised distribution.
'Absolutely surreal' – soldiers deny access to medical care
The onerous movement restrictions mean residents cannot access basic services or medical treatment, even when they desperately need it.
With both the Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) mobile health clinic and the local clinic in Tel Rumeida shuttered – and residents unable to reach them even if they were still open – Palestinians with medical emergencies are encountering a security apparatus entirely unmoved by their needs.

In the Jaber neighbourhood, a pregnant Palestinian woman woke up at 5am one morning in pain. According to the woman's mother and a family friend, soldiers stationed outside their home refused to allow her to leave for several hours. At around 11am, they managed to leave in a private car. Doctors at the hospital discovered internal bleeding – the baby had died.
In another case, a woman required an injection at a clinic only 20 metres away from her home. Despite prior attempts at coordination, guns were pointed at her when she tried to leave her home. Despite the insistence of medical professionals, a soldier at the scene decided the injection could wait until the next day.
According to the Jabari family member, another member of the family who had been injured while working waited for an ambulance for three and a half hours. It was held up because of the restrictions. In the end, relatives had to carry him all the way to the nearest checkpoint, worsening his leg injury.
'Decisions are being made over what is medically urgent or not by poorly trained military reservists,' said a humanitarian worker in the area. 'It is absolutely surreal.'
No income, savings running out
But what might be most pressing for these families is their dwindling cash reserves. Even in the other areas of Hebron, which are suffering because of a movement bottleneck into and out of the city, as well as because of business closures, Palestinians report dramatic income losses that have pushed families to the brink.
In H2, the economic situation is particularly dire.
'Most of the families in these areas, they are regular labourers, they are blue-collar people,' said Hamdan of HRC. 'If they don't work, they have no income. So how can they cover expenses if they cannot go to work?'
Families in H2 describe having to dip into whatever savings they have to buy food and supplies.
'The families help each other in this time,' said the Jabari family member, explaining how neighbours sneak between their houses in her area, comprised of about 100 families, to share food and supplies.
But with little to no income, neighbours can help each other for only so long.
'We are [financially] better off than some of our neighbours,' said Abu Aisha in Tel Rumeida. 'But we don't know how even we can sustain ourselves for more than a few weeks.'
Already, NGOs are privately discussing possible aid measures if the severe restrictions continue.
'They are depriving us of life'
Monitoring of the situation has been spotty, with international monitoring group the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI) leaving when war broke out and remaining civil society organisations finding it difficult to reach families under the movement restrictions.
Residents report having their phones confiscated, and photos and videos of incidents are routinely deleted from them by soldiers and settlers. One neighbour was detained for several days for recording soldier activities, according to Abu Aisha.

Residents say some families who had elsewhere to live have left, though no one knows how many have gone.
In the meantime, residents and humanitarian organisations report that settlers are taking advantage of the situation to occupy vacated properties in the Tel Rumeida area. Abu Aisha shared a video of Israeli settlers harvesting olives from trees owned by Palestinian families in the area.
Families have been unable to pick olives during the all-important harvest season, which runs until mid-November. No harvest this year would be economically catastrophic for some families.
Unable to go to school, work or play, the Jabaris try to keep their spirits up by reading religious scripture or telling the children stories at night.
'Like all Palestinians, we hope for a better reality than what we really live,' said the female Jabari family member.
But what's going on at home and on their televisions keeps them up at night.
'We're not able to really live life,' said Abu Aisha, who has nine people and three children staying in his home. 'Eating, drinking, going about our daily lives is difficult because all we can do is just sit in front of the television and take in these horrific images from Gaza.'
Family members sleep in shifts, terrified of what might come next.
'Settlers could come into our house and kill everyone, and no one would be able to do anything about it,' said Abu Aisha.
'It's a reflection of what's happening in Gaza,' said the Jabari family member, who also shared videos of nighttime raids around the family home this week.
'We are being deprived of basic freedoms. They are depriving us of life.'

Russian diplomacy leverages Israel-Hamas war for moral high ground

The European Union and the United States have framed their defence of Ukraine as a principled stance against an aggressor and a war criminal, Russia.
But Israel's prosecution of the war in Gaza is undermining their moral high ground and weakening criminal prosecutions against Russia, international relations and law experts say.
'When attacks on public infrastructure happened in Ukraine, it led to a discussion in terms of how they violated the Geneva Convention,' said Christian Bueger, a professor of international relations at the University of Copenhagen.
'Now we're facing a situation where in   and so on, we are clearly beyond the borders of  ,' he told Al Jazeera, referring to Israel's siege and subsequent raid of al-Shifa Hospital, where the lack of electricity, water and medicine has put patients' lives at risk.
'That opens up a discussion of what justified warfare looks like in terms of our contemporary age,' he said, and 'shatters what we thought was the set of norms of how military operations should be carried out'.
For Ukraine's Western allies, 'the moral high ground is shrouded in fog', said an editorial by Chatham House, a British think tank.
This has political and legal ramifications, complicating the task of holding Russia accountable for its crimes in Ukraine.
UN and European investigators have been documenting the suspected torture, rape and summary executions of civilians in Bucha, Izyum and elsewhere in Ukraine. These alleged war crimes and atrocities will be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction Ukraine accepts.
In March, the ICC indicted Russian President Vladimir Putin and his commissioner for children's rights for allegedly ordering the abduction of Ukrainian children, a war crime.
The ICC is also documenting alleged war crimes in what the ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, on Friday referred to as the State of Palestine. Israel does not recognise Palestine or the ICC's jurisdiction on what it considers its territory.
'The US and UK support the Israeli view. So it would be very difficult for these states now to argue, 'Yes, the ICC has jurisdiction over Russians who commit crimes in Ukraine, but no, it does not have jurisdiction over Israelis who commit crimes in Palestine,'" said Marko Milanovic, a professor of public international law at Reading University.
The US-UK view is clearly opposed by several Muslim-majority nations and some countries in the Global South.
Five of them - South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros and Djibouti - asked Khan to investigate and prosecute suspected crimes in Gaza.
The Global South's more ambivalent view of Russia's actions has further ramifications for Ukraine.
For a year, Ukraine has led an international effort to set up a   that will try Russia for its war of aggression - a crime under the UN Charter. To create this court, Ukraine needs to win a two-thirds majority in the UN General Assembly.
'For that court to have any chance of being remotely legitimate and successful, it needs to get support not just from Western allies of Ukraine but also from the nonaligned/Global South countries,' Milanovic told Al Jazeera.
'And now, after Gaza, most of these countries are not going to be willing to play ball The West has lost whatever moral leverage it had in pushing for this new institution the more the Gaza [war] goes on and the US supports Israel, the less other states will support this.'
Russian diplomacy
Russia has been quick to capitalise on the moral and legal murkiness Israel's counterattack on Hamas created.
Two days after the Hamas October 7 attack on Israel, Russia   to endorse a US-sponsored United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the attack, which killed about 1,200 Israelis.
'Their goal is to portray themselves as peacemakers, and they can't be seen as following the US lead,' said Maxim Alyukov, a researcher at Manchester University's department of Russian and East European studies, who monitors Russian official language and propaganda.
Russia's narrative, he said, is that 'terrorists have to be punished but you don't blame the nation for a few individuals, and you don't bomb Gaza for an Islamist group'.
That could be seen as indirect criticism of the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq after al-Qaeda's attacks on 9/11.
Russian President Vladimir Putin pinned some blame on the United States regarding the latest Middle East conflict.
"I think that many people will agree with me that this is a vivid example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East," Putin said in late October.
'They don't seem concerned that Palestinians are dying'
Russia claimed to support 'a multilateral approach to the Middle East settlement issue' in a November 7 Foreign Ministry statement that also criticised Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
'Nobody criticises Israel, and there are double standards here because when it comes to Ukraine, they openly criticise the fact that civilians are dying, but they don't seem concerned that Palestinians are dying,' said Alyukov, summarising the Russian position.
He called the Gaza war 'a gift to the Kremlin'.
Russia's position potentially weakens the rules-based international order Western states say they are trying to uphold, said experts, and many countries agree with Russia's accusations of double standards within it.
On November 18, US President Joe Biden asked, in an op-ed published in The Washington Post: 'Will we relentlessly pursue our positive vision for the future, or will we allow those who do not share our values to drag the world to a more dangerous and divided place?'
Earlier this year, Russia held a summit with African countries, a part of the Global South it is making particular efforts to cultivate with promises of cheap oil and grain, despite the fact that its war in Ukraine has raised the prices of both.
'African nations clearly signalled to Russia: 'Yes we are interested in cheaper supplies, but we are not willing to play the game of translating that into diplomatic support for Russia,'' said Bueger. 'The countries in the Global South know what game Russia is playing there.'

Israel-Saudi Arabia 'normalisation' deal in reach, Netanyahu tells Biden

September 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed confidence that a "historic" US-brokered agreement to establish formal diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia can be reached, as the Israeli prime minister held talks with US President Joe Biden.
The meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City on Wednesday was the first between the two leaders since   to power late last year.
The Biden administration has been pushing to   between Israel and Saudi Arabia, two top US allies in the Middle East.
"I think that under your leadership, Mr President, we can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia," the Israeli prime minister told Biden ahead of their talks.
"I think such a peace would go a long way first to advance the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict, achieve reconciliation between the Islamic world and the Jewish state, and advance a genuine peace between Israel and the Palestinians. This is something within our reach."
The discussions came as Israel continues to   against Palestinians in the occupied territories, drawing criticism from Palestinian rights defenders who have urged Biden to hold Israel accountable for abuses.
But on Wednesday, the US president called Netanyahu a "friend" and heaped praise on Israel.
"You've heard me say many times: Were there no Israel, we'd have to invent one, and I mean it," Biden said.
He also lauded a newly announced initiative to   from India to Europe, including by rail through Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel. "It's a big deal," he said.
Few Arab states have recognised Israel since its establishment in 1948, but former US President Donald Trump's administration helped secure agreements to establish relations between Israel and the   and Morocco in 2020.
Sudan also agreed to join the so-called normalisation deals, known as the Abraham Accords.
Amid Israeli leaders' calls for a similar pact with Saudi Arabia, Saudi officials have said Riyadh is sticking by the  .That plan conditions normalisation with Israel on its withdrawal from Arab territories and the establishment of a Palestinian state, as well as finding a 'fair solution' to the plight of Palestinian refugees.
In addition to the normalisation campaign, the Biden administration is pushing to include Israel in its  , which would allow Israelis to travel visa free to the US despite concerns about Israel's mistreatment of Palestinian Americans.
Despite their continued alliance, US-Israeli relations have been marked by recent friction between Biden and Netanyahu.
The US president   with Netanyahu earlier this year over the Israeli prime minister's push to overhaul Israel's judiciary, a move that his liberal critics say would weaken the rule of law in the country.
On Wednesday, Biden alluded to Netanyahu's judicial plan, which has been put on hold for months. "Today, we're going to discuss some of the hard issues," Biden said.
"And that is upholding democratic values that lie at the heart of our partnership, including checks and balances in our systems and preserving the path to a negotiated two-state solution."
Meanwhile, the US government has criticised Israel's push to expand illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank, as well as racist comments by   in Netanyahu's cabinet.
Biden also has not invited Netanyahu for an official visit to the White House, leading to criticism   and speculation about tensions between the two leaders.
But US officials regularly stress that American support for Israel, which leading rights groups have accused of maintaining a system of apartheid against Palestinians, is unwavering. Israel receives at least $3.8bn in US military aid annually.
Reporting from UN headquarters on Wednesday, Al Jazeera's diplomatic editor James Bays said a meeting with Netanyahu has been a "hot potato" issue for the  .
"The compromise … was not to have the meeting in the White House but on the sidelines [of the UNGA] here," Bays said.
As the two leaders met, Jewish-American and Israeli demonstrators protested in New York.
The protesters – several of whom were waving Israeli flags – rallied "to raise their objections" to the judicial overhaul plan, Al Jazeera's Kristen Saloomey reported.
"Many of the [demonstrators] that I spoke to say that they don't think Biden should be even meeting with Netanyahu," she added.

Israeli military forces have advanced further into the besieged Gaza Strip and   with Palestinian fighters near Gaza City, as the United Nations and medical staff expressed fears over air strikes hitting closer to hospitals.
Israeli soldiers and tanks   from two sides of Gaza City in the northern section of the strip on Monday, with Palestinian armed groups saying that they repelled Israeli tanks to the east of the city.
"Our duty today is [to] fight and fight," the Palestinian Islamic Jihad armed group said in a statement, adding that it was not the right time to discuss a potential ceasefire.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also dismissed   for a ceasefire, saying that such action would constitute 'surrender to terrorism'.

Israeli forces said that they "killed dozens of terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels and attempted to attack the troops' and that three Israeli troops have been killed in Gaza.
Israel also announced that it   a female Israeli soldier being held captive by the Palestinian armed group Hamas during its ground raids, which have expanded in recent days alongside its continuing  .
More than 8,300 people, including more than 3,400 children, have been killed in the bombardment, according to Gaza officials, and UN officials and aid organisations have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe as Israel continues to impose a "complete siege" on the territory.
Numerous strikes lit up the north sky in northern Gaza on Monday. Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group, an intelligence and security consultancy, told Al Jazeera that the latest strikes could include large bombs meant to destroy a network of underground tunnels utilised by Hamas.
'This could be the use of bunker busters, where the Israelis are dropping bombs meant to penetrate what we call hard and deeply buried targets,' said Clarke, adding that it was impossible to be certain.
A   has started to trickle into the beleaguered strip, with the Palestinian Red Crescent reporting that 26 trucks carrying aid entered through the Rafah crossing with Egypt on Monday.
No sign of a ceasefire
Speaking to reporters on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphatically rejected   for a ceasefire, saying that "this is a time for war".
The embattled prime minister also shot down questions about whether he will resign, as he faces widespread outrage from an Israeli public that holds his government responsible for a failure to stop an attack by   on October 7 that killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
'The failure of the Israeli security apparatus, they [the Israeli public] will not forgive him for that,' Abdelhamid Siyam, professor of political science at Rutgers University, told Al Jazeera, adding that the public 'believes in the army, but not in Netanyahu'.
Speaking in a televised address on Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that Hamas has two options: 'die fighting or to surrender without any conditions'.
The UN Security Council was holding an emergency meeting to deliberate on Israel's ground raids, with Al Jazeera's Gabriel Elizondo saying that the session would receive a briefing from Philippe Lazzarini, director of the UN agency on Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
"This was a meeting where the UNSC members want to get a firsthand assessment of the situation in Gaza right now, and that is what we expect that they'll be hearing," said Elizondo.
US national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Saudi Defence Minister Khalid bin Salman Al Saud in Washington, DC, on Monday to discuss regional tensions.
Russian president says US responsible for Middle East 'chaos'
Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the United States for the 'deadly chaos' in the Middle East in a televised address, calling the US a beneficiary of 'global instability'.
Putin also blamed Ukraine and Western nations for an outbreak of violence in the Russian republic of Dagestan on Sunday night, in which an angry crowd   in search of passengers scheduled to arrive on a flight from Israel.
Russian forces have themselves   in the Middle East for years, assisting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the country's bloody civil war and dispatching proxy forces such as the Wagner Group to Libya.
Turkey condemns targeting of hospital in Gaza
The Turkish foreign ministry has condemned 'in the strongest terms' an Israeli strike on the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship hospital in Gaza, stating that it had shared the coordinates of the hospital with Israeli authorities in advance.
Sobhi Skeik, director of the Turkish-funded cancer treatment hospital, called the attack 'the first direct hit on a medical facility'.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that it is unable to help resupply Al-Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals due to high risks.
'It's a disaster on top of a disaster. Health needs are soaring and our ability to meet those needs is rapidly declining,' said Rick Brennan, the agency's regional emergencies director.
Brennan called for a ceasefire and said that one third of Gaza's hospitals and more than 70 percent of clinics are now non-functioning.

Hezbollah's strategic calculation: Israel, Gaza and the domestic equation

Beirut, Lebanon – Hezbollah is well aware of Lebanon's public opinion on widening the war with Israel for its relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip since Hamas launched an attack on Israel on  , and that it has to tread carefully, analysts say.
In spite of   careful mixing of condemnations of Israel with words of restraint in a speech on Saturday, Israel's defence minister issued dire warnings against the Lebanese people.
Following that, there was a noticeable escalation in the attacks, which had started on October 8, between the two. Hezbollah launched attacks first, at Israeli positions in the  , which it considers occupied Lebanese land.
Many wondered if this meant Hezbollah would enter the battle fully, but there was silence from its Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah who waited weeks and then gave two speeches in eight days.
On November 11, Nasrallah spoke with relative restraint in his second speech, telling viewers that Hezbollah would expand its attacks on Israel to match their abuses of Palestinians or attacks on Lebanon but did not want to provoke a wider war.
The mismatch between Nasrallah's tone and Israel's response – promising to do to Beirut what it had done to Gaza – has raised questions including whether Israeli leaders have sensed some kind of hesitance or reluctance on the part of Nasrallah.
Palestinian presence in Lebanon
There has been a significant Palestinian presence in Lebanon since the 1967 war when large numbers of refugees came there seeking asylum.
Palestinian fighters from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) used Lebanese territory to launch attacks on Israel, drawing retaliation and eventually becoming involved in the Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990.

As such, some Lebanese communities retain a combination of trauma and animosity towards Palestinians. But even among those groups, there is widespread opposition to Israeli military actions against civilians in Gaza.
The confrontation with Israel seems to have reinvigorated Hezbollah, which seems more in tune than at any point since 2006. Still, despite that, Nasrallah and party leadership cadres will be making efforts to show the group as a rational actor that will not callously enter a wider war with Israel, analysts told Al Jazeera.
'Hezbollah does not have the same support they had in 2006,' Joseph Daher, author of Hezbollah: The Political Economy of Lebanon's Party of God, told Al Jazeera. 'Socially and politically they are much more isolated.'
In  , Hezbollah and Israel fought a 34-day war that killed 1,150 people, mostly Lebanese civilians. Despite the damage and loss of Lebanese lives, the war was considered a draw, sending Hezbollah's regional popularity soaring for their ability to confront Israel's military power.
But in subsequent years, a series of domestic confrontations and their intervention in the Syrian civil war have eroded Hezbollah's popular support outside their base.
In 2008, Hezbollah took over West Beirut when the Lebanese government attempted to dismantle its telecommunications network, angering many outside their direct support base. The party also saw dissent from past supporters during the  against the deteriorating situation in Lebanon.
In his   on Saturday, Nasrallah cited 'dissenting voices in Lebanon', which could include figures like Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Druze community leader Walid Jumblatt, who have called to keep Lebanon out of a wider confrontation with Israel.
Some observers believe Nasrallah was referring to Lebanese Forces party leader Samir Geagea.
The right-wing nationalist Lebanese Forces are staunch opponents of Hezbollah and decry the group's arms as undermining the centrality of the Lebanese state and the government's power. While they aren't an existential threat to Hezbollah, the group is aware of their opponent's sentiments.
'Hezbollah doesn't see the Lebanese Forces as a military threat,' Nicholas Noe, who edited Voice of Hezbollah: The Statements of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said. 'But they are a factor in their wider thinking.'
The Forces resent Hezbollah's ability to wage war without the backing of the state but they and their allies have chosen not to be particularly vocal at this moment in time, Daher said.
Strategic calculations
'Hezbollah doesn't want the war right now but if it comes then so be it,' Noe said, adding that it is important for Hezbollah to show that if the war expands to the rest of Lebanon, it wasn't due to 'Hezbollah's stupid mistakes or bald provocation'.
Whether this contributes to Israel's belligerent language towards its northern neighbour, counting on the fact that Hezbollah will do everything it can to stay out of a big war, remains to be seen.
For the time being, Hezbollah's calculations on the border with Israel are linked to military considerations in Gaza, according to Amal Saad Ghorayeb, author of Hizbu'llah: Politics and Religion.
And those calculations are strategically linked to Israel's effectiveness in fighting Hamas, rather than civilian death tolls, Ghorayeb added.
Should Hamas be routed in Gaza, Hezbollah worries Israel will turn its attention to Lebanon, and so its strategy has been to divide the Israeli military's attention, pulling the force of its full arsenal away from Gaza.
Hezbollah will prolong that tactic until the fighting in Gaza stops, according to Nasrallah. But a wider war would benefit neither Hezbollah nor its partner Iran.
A lot of analysis on Hezbollah has painted the group as beholden to Iran but it is wrong to call Hezbollah an Iranian puppet, Daher said. 'Hezbollah, like Hamas, has agency and they discuss their options with Iran.'
Analysts – and a 2019 report  by the think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) – agree, saying Hezbollah acts in its own interests, despite enjoying support, coordination and collaboration with Iran.
In short, these analyses agree, Hezbollah isn't waiting on Iran's orders, though Iran might be advising their allies to do all they can to avoid expanding the war.
'Iran doesn't want to lose Hezbollah, their crown jewel in the regional network of their influence,' Daher said.

Gaza truce appears set to extend as Israel receives new list of captives

A truce in the Israel-Hamas war appeared to be extending into a fifth day as the two sides completed their   in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails under an original four-day truce deal while mediators said  .
Qatar, which along with Egypt has facilitated indirect talks between Israel and Hamas, said that there was an agreement to extend by two days the original four-day truce that was to expire on Monday.
"We have an extension … two more days," Qatar's Ambassador to the United Nations Alya Ahmed Saif Al-Thani told reporters after a closed-door UN Security Council meeting on Monday, saying both sides were to release more people.
"This is a very positive step," Al-Thani said.
While the Israeli government had yet to officially confirm the truce extension by early on Tuesday morning, Israel's Army Radio, citing the prime minister's office, reported that a new list of captives - who are expected to be released later in the day - had been received.
Israel has said it would extend the ceasefire by one day for every 10 additional captives released by Hamas.
Local news website Axios reported the latest list contained the names of 10 Israeli captives. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli prime minister's office.
Israel on Monday said 11 Israelis had been returned to the country from the Gaza Strip, bringing to 69 the total number of Israeli and foreign captives released by Hamas since Friday under the truce.
The Israel Prison Service said 33 Palestinian prisoners were also released on Monday from Israel's Ofer prison in the West Bank and from a detention centre in Jerusalem, bringing the total number of Palestinians it has freed since Friday to 150.
The freed Palestinian prisoners were greeted by loud cheers as the Red Cross bus they were travelling in made its way through the streets of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
The original truce agreement also allowed more aid trucks into Gaza, where the civilian population faces shortages of food, fuel, drinking water and medicine.
While describing the extension of the truce as "a glimpse of hope and humanity", UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said two more days was not enough time to meet Gaza's aid needs.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said in a report on Monday that the four-day pause in hostilities had allowed humanitarian aid groups, particularly Red Crescent workers, to provide assistance to people   where 1.8 million people are internally displaced.

More than 14,800 people have been killed in Gaza - including some 10,000 women and children - since Israel launched its attacks on the Palestinian enclave following Hamas's October 7 raid on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people.
Israel's intense bombing of the densely populated Gaza Strip has also resulted in 46,000 homes destroyed and more than 234,000 damaged -about 60 percent of the entire housing stock in Gaza, the UN said in the report.
Despite the apparent extension of the truce for two additional days, Israel remains committed to crushing Hamas militarily and has warned that its war on Gaza will resume.
Resumption will likely see Israeli forces expand their air, land and sea offensive from the devastated northern Gaza to the south of the enclave where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled seeking refuge.

An official of Hamas has said the group that rules Gaza could not release the Israeli captives it is holding until a ceasefire is agreed in the  , according to Russia's Kommersant newspaper.
The newspaper quoted an official called Abu Hamid as saying on Friday that the group needed time to locate all of those who had been taken to Gaza by various Palestinian factions during a Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, that prompted the war.
Abu Hamid, a member of a Hamas delegation that arrived in Moscow on Thursday, said that Hamas announced its intention to release 'the civilian prisoners' since the first days of the war.
'Hundreds of citizens and dozens of fighters from various Palestinian factions entered the territories occupied in 1948, and … they captured dozens of people – most of them civilians,' he said.
'We need time to find them in the Gaza Strip and then release them,' the official added.
Abu Hamid also said that the Israeli air raids on Gaza have killed 50 of the captives.
Reporting from Moscow, journalist Yulia Shapovalova said the visit by the Hamas delegation was largely seen an attempt by Russia to declare that it is not on the sidelines of the conflict.
Moscow wants to show 'it remains an important regional player, meeting the representatives of Hamas and trying to mediate the conflict', she said.
She also said there is hope that a meeting that took place between Russian, Iranian and Hamas officials is expected to lead to the release of the three captives with Russian passports who are being held by Hamas.
Shapovalova added that Hamas did not make any comments on the possibility of freeing the captives in question.
Four captives freed
More than 200 captives are being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip after being captured during the Palestinian group's October 7 onslaught, according to Israel.
Hamas on Monday   two elderly Israeli civilian women from the besieged enclave following the release of two captives with dual US-Israeli nationality on Friday.
The mediation efforts between the two sides over the captives are led by Egypt and Qatar.
More than 7,000 Palestinians, including at least 2,913 children, have been  in Israeli   targeting Gaza since October 7.
More than 1,400 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel, which started on October 7 and reportedly ended a day later.
Israel has cut off Gaza's access to essential supplies, including fuel, as it   that has destroyed entire neighbourhoods and brought humanitarian conditions to breaking point.

Canada says it is confident Israel not behind deadly blast at Gaza hospital

Canada has a "high degree of confidence" that Israel was not responsible for the deadly explosion at Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza, its defence department has said, adding to a flurry of claims and counterclaims about the contested blast.
The Canadian Forces Intelligence Command determined that the blast was more likely caused by an errant rocket fired from Gaza after an analysis using open source and classified information, Minister of National Defence Bill Blair said in a statement on Sunday.
'Canada is deeply saddened by the loss of life caused by the explosion at Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza on October 17, 2023," Blair said.
"We reiterate our sincere condolences to all those who lost loved ones."
Blair added that officials would provide updates as new information becomes available.
The Department of National Defence said in a separate statement that the assessment was informed by an analysis of the blast site and the flight of the incoming munition.
"Reporting from Canada's allies corroborates DND/CAF's findings. We will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available," the department said.
The Canadian assessment comes after the United States and France released similar findings suggesting Israel was not behind the explosion.
On Friday, France's Directorate of Military Intelligence said that its intelligence indicated that an errant Palestinian rocket with an explosive charge of about 5kg was the likely cause of the explosion.
The cause of the blast at Al-Ahli Hospital and the resulting death toll have been bitterly contested.
Palestinian officials blamed an Israeli air strike, while Israel said the explosion was caused by a misfiring rocket launched by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which has denied responsibility.
An investigation by Al Jazeera cast doubt on Israeli statements that a flash captured in a live news broadcast showed a Palestinian rocket misfiring before striking the hospital.
Gaza's health ministry said 471 people were killed in the explosion, a death toll Israel says has been deliberately inflated.
US intelligence agencies have estimated a death toll of 100-300 people.
On Friday, the United Nations called for an independent investigation into the explosion.

Japan has announced sanctions against nine people and a company over their alleged links to the Palestinian armed group Hamas.
Japan's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday the measures would freeze assets belonging to individuals and a company that have helped fund Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip.
The sanctions follow the announcement of similar measures by the United States earlier this month.
Tokyo has attempted to walk a fine line on the Israel-Hamas war as it tries to balance relations with the US, its closest ally, and ties to energy-supplying partners in the Middle East.
Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio has condemned Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel and called for the immediate release of the group's captives, while expressing concern about civilian deaths in Gaza and the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the enclave.
Hamas's surprise attack killed at least 1,405 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 8,306 Palestinians, including more than 3,400 children, according to officials in Gaza.
Last week, Japanese officials called on Israel to suspend its assault on Gaza to allow humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave.
Tokyo, however, on Friday abstained from voting on a  .
Japanese Foreign Ministry Kamikawa Yoko said her country had abstained in part due to the resolution's failure to explicitly condemn Hamas, echoing the stance of a number of countries including Australia and India.
The non-binding resolution, which was proposed by Jordan, passed overwhelmingly, with 120 votes in favour.
The US and Israel were among 14 countries that voted against the resolution.

German police crack down on pro-Palestine rallies, raising alarm

November 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Berlin, Germany – Early-afternoon on Saturday in central Berlin, officers led an elderly German woman away to a police van so her sign could be checked.
She was preparing to attend a march calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.
Her banner, which said she was ashamed to be German and that there was a "genocide" taking place in the densely populated Palestinian enclave being bombarded by Israel.
Police let her and her sign go, and she joined the march.
Later, as the rally got under way, a group of officers in riot gear readied themselves in front of a crowd of chanting protesters.
An estimated 8,000 to 10,000 people marched in the German capital. About 1,000 police were deployed in part to prevent any anti-Semitic speeches or signage.
Until recently, most pro-Palestinian demonstrations were banned in Berlin because local authorities feared an outburst of violence or anti-Semitism.But the decision was criticised as breaching the democratic right to freedom of assembly.
In the past two weeks, several protests have been permitted, including Saturday's march.

At about 4pm, police pushed into the crowd and, to calls of "shame, shame", pulled Monika Kalinowska out.
Her sign, written in red, read, "Israel is a terrorist state."
"I am really starting to question whether we actually have freedom of speech in Germany," saidKalinowska, who described the episode as exasperating.
After she was frisked and her identification checked, she was told there was nothing wrong with her sign – even though it was confiscated – and she was allowed to leave. She could pick up the sign the next day, police said.
"But the thing that made me really mad was when the policeman asked me if I identified as a woman," she said. "I was not saying anything illegal and, I mean, if you don't respect my freedom of speech, how are you going to respect whether I identify as a man or a woman?"
The officer who briefly removed Kalinowska from the protest told Al Jazeera that there was no formal list or any particular guidelines to follow.
"Really, I just use my intuition," he said. "If I see something I think is bad, we go and get it."
In another case, a large poster calling German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "deadly assassins" was taken away.
A group of young Italians were told to destroy theirs, which said, "Stop the genocide. Stop the apartheid."
"He told me that if I said these things, I could be arrested," one of the Italians, who requested anonymity, told Al Jazeera.
"No, I didn't," the police officer argued back. "I said you could be arrested if you said those things under certain circumstances."
Asked what those circumstances might be, the officer told Al Jazeera, "I don't want to get into this with you."
"There are certain symbols that are forbidden," said another officer, referring to Germany's  , the Palestinian group that rules Gaza and was behind the deadly attacks in Israel on October 7.
In a statement to Al Jazeera, police spokesperson Anja Dierschke said officers had acted in line with previously issued guidelines on the Middle East conflict and a public prosecutor had been available in the operations room during the protest to answer any legal questions.
In the end, seven offences related to signage were recorded, police said.
While the job of identifying illegal signs is difficult for police, their measures at protests have a "chilling" effect, lawyers at the European Legal Support Center (ELSC), told Al Jazeera.
"People now wonder if what they wear or say will get them arrested or even deported," said a spokesperson for the ELSC, which provides legal support regarding Palestinian issues and has an office in Berlin.
"The police are basically deciding the law on the street. They seem to have deployed wide discretionary powers, almost declaring a state of emergency, but without any legal basis. It resembles the practices of an authoritarian regime."
'It still has to be tolerated'
Germany has what it calls a "special responsibility" to the Jewish people, to Israel and to combatting anti-Semitism because it was responsible for the Holocaust.
The country mainly uses two laws to prosecute the public expression of hate speech.
Section 130 of the criminal code regards incitement against a certain group of people, which has previously been used to combat the glorification of Nazi Germany, Holocaust denial, and anti-Semitic, racist or homophobic hate speech. Punishment ranges from a fine to up to five years in prison.
Section 140looks at whether crimes are being condoned in a way that incites further violence or disturbs the peace.
But Michael Wrase, a professor of public law and a constitutional law expert at the Berlin Social Science Center, said it is difficult for police deployed at protests to make decisions on whether certain signs and banners break the law.
"It's a tightrope that everyone is walking," he explained.
While raising a Hamas flag, for example, is clearly prosecutable, others acts are not.
"Because with some symbols or signs, the interpretation can be quite different according to who is observing them," said Wrase.
Ultimately, context is key.
For example, chanting, "  , Palestine will be free," on October 8, immediately after Hamas attacked Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 240, could well be seen as celebrating violence as well as inciting more.
However, chanting the same slogan during a "Ceasefire Now" demonstration a month and more than 10,000 Palestinian deaths later has a different context as do signs that say things like "From the river to the sea, we demand equality."
In mid-October, Berlin's public prosecutor said the "river to the sea" slogan would be prosecuted.
But the legalities of that decision have yet to be tested in a German court.
In mid-August, a Dutch court refused to prosecute an activist who had used the rhyme in a 2021 speech, saying such charges were unfounded.
While the situation is heated, the law should – as the saying goes – be blind, said Wrase.
Case law in Germany, all the way to the country's highest court, indicates that freedom of assembly is a priority and that all protesters should first be given the benefit of the doubt, which is why far-right activists can still hold rallies.
"Even if you don't agree with what people are demonstrating for, it still has to be tolerated," said Wrase.
"And as a general rule - this is also set by the Federal Constitutional Court - if you have different possibilities to interpret a certain slogan, you should err on the side of interpreting it to be lawful. You have to give the benefit of the doubt to those exercising their democratic freedoms."'
'Chilling' effect
Thomas Fischer, a former presiding judge at the Federal Court of Justice, the country's highest criminal court, agreed with Wrase, saying, "Even if an opinion is morally dubious or just plain wrong, the German constitution says you still have the right to express it."
"Nobody should be using criminal or civil law to ensure that the only opinions expressed are those the German government agrees with," he said.
For example, criticising the Israeli government and its actions is not anti-Semitic, Fischer explained.
"It would be ridiculous to equate all Jewish people with the government of Israel. That, would, in fact, be ant-Semitic."
Over the past month, German politicians have called for changing various laws, including those around the right to demonstrate and freedom of opinion.
The idea of withdrawing citizenship, residency, welfare benefits or funding from anyone accused of making anti-Semitic statements has been floated as well as a plan to only allow "native Germans" to protest.
This week, as community tensions boil across Europe as a result of the Gaza war, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier   to "speak for yourselves and make a clear stand against terror", a comment that was decried by some as discriminatory because it singled out minority groups.
"It's too soon to tell what the impact of these calls from conservative politicians will be in concrete terms," the ELSC spokesperson said.
"But these are racist policies in action. We still have courts of law in Germany, and if necessary, we will go there in order to protect fundamental rights because this blurred situation is extremely dangerous for our democracy."

Out of medicines, care: Gaza's cancer patients face death amid Israel war

November 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza Strip – Sitting in her wheelchair, Saida Barbakh looks around at the crowded classroom in a United Nations-run school in Khan Younis that is her current home. She sighs deeply.
The 62-year-old bone cancer patient's medication had run out several days earlier. She had been treated at Al Makassed Hospital in occupied East Jerusalem, and following a successful yet complicated surgery, she returned to the Gaza Strip on October 5, two days before the war began.
"I was supposed to go back after two weeks for a medical check-up," she says. 'I did not expect things to reach this level of danger."
The UN-run schools, where 725,000 displaced Palestinians have taken shelter from unrelenting Israeli bombardment for more than a month, are far from ideal to house sick patients. A lack of electricity, clean running water, food and bedding, and inadequate washroom facilities, are turning the schools into Petri dishes for an  , mainly respiratory infections, diarrhoea and skin rashes.
"I feel that I need care and sleep and I cannot move a lot in this wheelchair," Barbakh said. "Living in this ugly and painful war with cancer is really awful."
Barbakh, who is from the town of Bani Suhaila east of Khan Younis, was initially recovering at the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, the only one for cancer treatment in the Gaza Strip.
But the hospital was forced to   on November 1, after running out of fuel due to Israel's continuing blockade of the Gaza Strip. The building had also sustained heavy damage from repeated Israeli attacks on the surrounding areas, the Ministry of Health said. More than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's bombing of Gaza since October 7.
Barbakh was among 70 cancer patients evacuated from the hospital to go south, but after her house was damaged as a result of Israeli bombing – turning much of the area into a ghost town – she and her family had no choice but to stay at a shelter school.
Only clinical care available
The Palestinian Authority health minister, Mai al-Kaila, warns that the lives of these 70 cancer patients are under serious threat because of the lack of treatment and health follow-ups.
Overall, the 2,000 cancer patients in the Gaza Strip are living in "catastrophic health conditions as a result of the ongoing Israeli aggression on the Strip and the mass displacement", al-Kaila said.
Subhi Sukeyk, the director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, said more than a month after the start of the war, medicines have run out.
"Specialised treatments for cancer patients, such as chemotherapy and treatment that combines several medications, cannot be provided," Sukeyk told Al Jazeera. "Some patients were transferred to Dar Essalam Hospital in Khan Younis, which they say is safe, but there is no safe place in Gaza at all."
Dar Essalam Hospital cannot offer medicines or cancer treatment, but it does provide patients with basic clinical care, he said.
But some of the cancer patients have asked to join their families in the shelter schools to die among them because they know that the hospitals cannot provide them with treatment, he added.
"Every day, we lose two or three cancer patients," Sukeyk said. "On the night the patients were transferred from the Turkish Friendship Hospital," he says, "four of them died. The previous night six patients died."
At the Turkish Friendship Hospital, only a few patients remain. Among them is Salem Khreis, a 40-year-old leukaemia patient.
"There's no medicine or treatment," he said. "I can't explain how terrible the pain is."
Khreis said he appreciates that the doctors are always by the side of their patients, but beyond their reassurances, there is nothing else they can do.
"They stand with us and tell us they are with us, but their eyes are full of sadness and helplessness from how much we are suffering," he said.
"Can we die from the siege? Is it not enough for Israel that we suffer from cancer? Save us from this injustice."
Last week, Turkey's health minister said his country and Egypt had agreed to send 1,000 cancer patients and other injured civilians needing urgent care in Gaza to Turkey for treatment. No other details were offered.
No medical referrals or permits approved
The Gaza Strip's healthcare facilities have been stretched under a 16-year Israeli blockade. Before October 7, Sukeyk said, he handed the Health Ministry about 1,000 medical referrals for cancer patients every year for their proper treatment and care in more specialised hospitals outside the besieged territory.
Patients and their relatives must submit a medical permit request, which can only be approved by the Israeli Coordination and Liaison Administration. Overall, about 20,000 patients per year sought permits from Israel to leave the Gaza Strip for healthcare before the war, almost a third of them children.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Israel approved about 63 percent of these medical exit applications in 2022.
That all has come to a grinding halt. Hospitals overcrowded because of a high number of Palestinians wounded in Israeli attacks have started discharging cancer patients to make room for those injured.
Sukeyk said some of the cancer patients who were waiting for their medical permits have died, but is unable to confirm the exact number because of the chaos of the war.
"If a patient hasn't been receiving treatment, then the spread of cancer in their body is inevitable and they will die," he said.
Reem Asraf, who has thyroid cancer, has also run out of her medication. She was supposed to get treated at Al Makassed Hospital in East Jerusalem, but the Beit Hanoon crossing, known as Erez to Israelis, in the north has not been in function since October 7.
Asraf underwent two surgeries including one to remove the tumour from her neck, but needs further treatment and check-ups.
"I cannot move or even stand due to the deterioration of my health and the lack of painkillers necessary for my condition," she said, speaking from Khan Younis after she was displaced from her home in Gaza City.
"In the face of the scenes of death and destruction, words cannot describe what we cancer patients are suffering through."

Why is Gaza's al-Shifa hospital at the heart of Israel's war?

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
For Palestinians in Gaza, it's the "house of healing". For Israel, it's Hamas's main command centre.
Al-Shifa, the biggest hospital in the enclave, is now at breaking point, battling to treat thousands of patients as it comes under direct attack from the Israeli military.
Last week, the Israeli army   outside the hospital, part of a convoy that was meant to carry patients from Gaza City to the Rafah border crossing, so they could be treated in Egypt. Fifteen people were killed in the attack, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which had coordinated the journey with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Gaza.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the attack, which killed people inside and around the ambulance, should be investigated as a possible war crime.

On Monday, it was reported that Israeli forces had again targeted the hospital, this time hitting a   that provided electricity to its main departments. With barely any fuel left in its tanks to keep its one generator running, it's now only a matter of time before the hospital is forced to switch off vital equipment like ventilators and dialysis machines, leaving patients to die.
Here's what you need to know about al-Shifa and why is it being targeted:
What is al-Shifa?
Dar al-Shifa, literally translated as "house of healing", is the largest and most extensive medical complex in the strip, comprising three specialised facilities: surgical, internal medicine, and obstetrics and gynaecology.
Located in the northern Remal neighbourhood, close to the port, the site originally housed British Army barracks. It became a hospital in 1946, undergoing successive expansions under Egyptian rule and during the Israeli occupation in the 1980s.
The hospital has become a lifeline for people seeking urgent medical intervention. Like all hospitals in the besieged strip – bar the Jordanian field hospital, which received an   of medical aid at midnight on Sunday – it has been denied urgently needed supplies of medicine and fuel.
It has the capacity to treat 700 patients, but right now doctors are treating 5000, according to a recent report  by Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF.Thousands of people who have lost their homes are living in the hospital corridors and in the courtyard.

Already overwhelmed, the hospital has been flooded with bodies and wounded patients since last week's bombing of the Abu Assi school, run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). Casualties mounted on Sunday, following one of the heaviest nights of bombardment seen so far, which saw the Israeli military hit 450 targets  in the north – including the nearby Shati refugee camp.
Dr Marwan Abusada, the hospital's head of surgery, said that al-Shifa can offer 210 beds on normal days. Currently, 800 patients are waiting to be admitted, he said in a statement relayed to Al Jazeera by NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP).
The hospital is also low on personnel. Israeli air attacks have killed 150 medical staff in the strip.
What are conditions like right now?
'At all levels, we are dealing with a health disaster," said Dr Abusada.
MSF, which supplied al-Shifa with the medicines and equipment that it still has in its stock, has reported that surgeons at the hospital are operating on patients without painkillers. Short on beds, surgeons have amputated limbs as patients lie on the floor.
With nowhere to keep patients in the unhygienic conditions, patients who have undergone surgical procedures run a high risk of infection. 'We have a type of worm, called white flies, covering the wounds after the surgery. They appear after one day,' said Dr Abusada.
Running on empty, the hospital is barely able to deliver needs, conserving its electricity supply for its emergency unit, intensive care and operating rooms. 'We are trying hard to continue delivering services to the patients who need kidney dialysis, urgent catheterisation and incubators, but we are delivering the bare minimum,' said the doctor.
On Monday, an Al Jazeera   depicted scenes of chaos outside and inside the hospital, with bloodied patients lining the corridors. Having just pronounced a man dead, surgeon Sara Al Saqqa spoke of living, sleeping and waking at the hospital, working as many as 72 consecutive hours.
'Every day, we say today was the worst ever, then the next day is worse,' she said, adding later that there aren't enough freezers to keep the corpses.
At the weekend, the hospital was forced to   to the private Al Helou International Hospital in Gaza City. An estimated 50,000 pregnant women  are caught up in the conflict, according to the United Nations Population Fund in Palestine. Premature births and miscarriages are on the rise, owing to the fear and panic caused by bombardment.
In northern Gaza, where the hospital is located, the main sources of water – a desalination plant and the pipeline from Israel – have been shut down since the start of the war. At present, the hospital only receives salty groundwater, unsuitable for drinking and hygiene. According to the UN, only 5 percent  of Gaza's water needs are being met.
Why is it under attack?
Al-Shifa is a prime target for Israeli forces, which claim the hospital is located above the headquarters of Hamas, the armed group that has governed Gaza since 2007.
Last month, the Israeli military released a video that used a combination of satellite imagery and animated graphics to claim that it had intelligence-based proof of Hamas's purported use of the hospital below ground, with tunnels, facilities and meeting rooms. Hamas has rejected those claims, which it said is sheltering more than  .
It's not the first time that links have been drawn between Hamas and al-Shifa. Following Israel's 2014 ground offensive in Gaza, Amnesty International accused Hamas of committing 'spine-chilling'   in abandoned areas of the hospital to extract confessions of collaboration. In an earlier report, the rights group had also accused Israel of war crimes  during its incursion, which killed more than 2100 people.
Back then, too, the hospital had come under attack. Israel and Hamas traded blame for an explosion at the hospital that reportedly killed at least 10 children. Hamas blamed the blast on an Israeli drone attack, while Israel claimed it had been caused by a failed Palestinian rocket. The episode had shades of a similarly disputed, but much deadlier explosion at al-Ahli Arab Hospital last month.
In the current conflict, Israel has accused Hamas of storing fuel for its own operations, preventing more supplies from entering in the limited number of humanitarian convoys crossing into the strip. With no power, 16 out of the 35 hospitals in the Gaza Strip have stopped working.

What next for al-Shifa?
As Israeli forces close in, the outlook is bleak for al-Shifa. At the time of writing, Israeli troops had severed northern Gaza from the rest of the enclave and were engaging Hamas fighters in the heart of Gaza City.
Israel has insisted that it wants to rout Hamas, destroy the alleged headquarters below the hospital and hunt down the group's fighters. It has also said it wants to assume   for the foreseeable future.

Rizwan dedicates Pakistan's cricket win to 'brothers and sisters in Gaza'

Pakistan cricketer Muhammad Rizwan has faced a backlash in India after he dedicated his team's recent   against Sri Lanka to the people of Gaza, who have faced relentless Israeli bombardment over the last few days.
Rizwan was adjudged the player of the match after he scored a century as Pakistan completed the tournament's highest-ever successful run chase to beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in Hyderabad, India.
"This was for our brothers and sisters in Gaza," he wrote in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday.
This was for our brothers and sisters in Gaza.
Happy to contribute in the win. Credits to the whole team and especially Abdullah Shafique and Hassan Ali for making it easier.
Extremely grateful to the people of Hyderabad for the amazing hospitality and support throughout.
- Muhammad Rizwan (@iMRizwanPak) October 11, 2023
The 31-year-old wicketkeeper batter also wrote a message of condolence for the people affected by the  , but it was his show of support to the besieged Palestinians that has drawn a backlash from cricket fans in India.
Pakistan will take on archrivals India in their next game in Ahmedabad on Saturday, and some Indian fans have asked the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) to boycott the match and ban Rizwan from playing in the tournament.
Some Indian fans asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to ban Rizwan for his "totally insane" post.
Dear ICC , Please Ban @iMRizwanPak
This Is Totally Insane  https://t.co/BVbo2nBTxY
- Vaibhav Bhola (@VibhuBhola) October 11, 2023
One Indian fan criticised an "unbothered" BCCI for giving Pakistani cricketers "a platform for Palestine agenda" that would "instigate Indian supporters of Hamas and Palestine".
Meanwhile, Indian journalist Sudhir Chaudhary wrote on X that: "This #ICCCricketWorldCup23  is not just cricket but also a battleground of political and religious ideology."

- Sudhir Chaudhary (@sudhirchaudhary) October 11, 2023
The ICC has previously ruled against players making political statements, although they are free to use their own media platforms away from the field of play.
In 2014, the global governing body banned England all-rounder Moeen Ali from wearing wristbands saying "Save Gaza" and "Free Palestine".
And in 2019, India's MS Dhoni was ordered by ICC to remove gloves with a controversial dagger logo – apparently a military symbol – in a World Cup game against Australia.
However, there seems little chance that the BCCI will take action over Rizwan's statement.
Reports in the Indian media indicate that the BCCI is treating Saturday's marquee clash as the main event of the Cricket World Cup and has planned a grand pre-match ceremony after deciding not to have an opening ceremony on the tournament's opening day.
The special treatment reserved for Saturday's match has not escaped some Indian fans' criticism. They say the BCCI will not boycott the Pakistani team in the biggest match of the tournament.
People here are deluded if they believe that BCCI boycotts bilaterals and plays a WC game, only because it's a WC and they can't avoid it.
First, a reserve day only for Ind Pak and now this.
Money > patriotism. The sooner general public realises this hypocrisy, the better it https://t.co/ZDYI9LBSHG

Israel   with air raids, killing more than 1,400 people after putting the enclave under "total siege" since last week.
This was in response to   by the Palestinian group Hamas in Israel on Saturday, in which at least 1,300 people were killed.

G7 calls for 'humanitarian pauses' in Israel's bombardment of Gaza

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Top diplomats from the Group of Seven (G7) have called for 'humanitarian pauses' in Israel's bombardment in order to deliver aid to desperate Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip.
The foreign ministers from the leading industrial democracies announced on Wednesday that they have agreed upon a unified stance on the Israel-Hamas war, following intensive meetings in Tokyo.
They released a statement that condemned Hamas and supported Israel's right to self-defence but called for humanitarian pauses in Israel's shelling of Gaza.
The G7 statement sought to balance criticism of Hamas's attacks and support for Israel with a push for 'urgent action' to help civilians in the besieged Palestinian enclave, who are in desperate need of food, water, medical care and shelter.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Italy emphasised that they 'support humanitarian pauses to facilitate urgently needed assistance, civilian movement and release of hostages'.
There was also condemnation of 'the rise in extremist settler violence committed against Palestinians', which the ministers said is 'unacceptable, undermines security in the West Bank, and threatens prospects for a lasting peace'.
At least 154 Palestinians have been killed and 2,150 arrested by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war broke out a month ago, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society.
As the diplomats met in central Tokyo, a United Nations agency said thousands of Palestinians are fleeing south on foot in Gaza with only what they can carry after running out of food and water in the north.
Israel said its troops were battling Hamas fighters deep inside Gaza City, which was home to about 650,000 people before the war and where the Israeli military says Hamas has its central command and a vast labyrinth of tunnels.
Since October 7, the Israeli bombardment has killed more than 10,000 Palestinians, about 40 percent of them children, according to counts by Gaza's health officials.
Nearly two-thirds of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are internally displaced, according to UN figures, with thousands seeking refuge at hospitals, including in makeshift canvas shelters in their car parks.
Hospitals across the enclave have come under fire, with many struggling to continue operating amid shortages of fuel and medical supplies.
The UN says Gaza's health, sanitation, water and food services are nearing 'breaking point'.

Here is the  on Monday, October 16, 2023:
Fighting
A 'massive fireball' has been reported in Gaza, after 'multiple air strikes' by the Israeli military, leaving several people dead in the last few hours.
Iran   escalation if it failed to end aggressions against Palestinians. Its foreign minister said other parties in the region were ready to act, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.
The expected Israeli ground offensive and air attacks have raised fears of unprecedented suffering in the narrow, impoverished  , one of the most crowded places in the world.
Human impact
At least 2,670 Palestinians, a quarter of them children, have been killed in Israeli air raids. The number of Israelis killed in Hamas's military operation stands at 1,400, including 286 soldiers.
Gaza health officials are storing the bodies of Palestinians killed by Israeli air strikes in ice cream freezer trucks because moving them to hospitals is too risky and cemeteries lack space.
Military forensic teams in Israel examined the bodies of victims of last week's Hamas attack on communities around the Gaza Strip and found multiple signsof torture, rape and other atrocities, officers said.
Reserves offuelat all hospitals across the   are expected to last only around 24 more hours, the United Nations humanitarian office (OCHA) said on Monday.
The Rafah crossing in southern Gaza will only be opened for 'a few hours' on Monday at (06:00 GMT) and then be shut off again in the late afternoon, the US television channel ABC is reporting.
Palestinians are desperate to find a safe hiding place, but the journey to the south is also fraught with risks. Hamas has told people not to leave and says roads out are unsafe.
Diplomacy
US President Joe Biden warned Israel that any occupation of Gaza would be a 'big mistake'.
Egypt said it stepped up diplomatic efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi told visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Israel's bombardment was disproportionate.
  will return to Israelon Monday, a senior State Department official said, extending his Middle East shuttle diplomacy by a day. He arrived in Israel on Thursday and has since visited six Arab countries.
Israel has announced that it is 'halting security exports' to Colombia following President Gustavo Petro's remarks on the war with Hamas.
Commenting on Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announcing a 'complete siege' of Gaza in a fight against 'animals', Petro said: 'This is what the Nazis said of the Jews.'
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said he spoke by phone to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas about the situation in Gaza and pressed for the establishment of a humanitarian aid corridor to help the local population.
Business and economy
The war will have an impact on Israel's budget, but it will be manageable since it entered the conflict with a solid fiscal position, Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron said. It is difficult to put exact numbers on how the budget may be affected, he told a panel of the G30 – a group of high-profile economists and policymakers.
Geopolitical risks for financial markets are risingwhile investors wait to see if the conflict draws in other countries, with the potential to   and deal a new blow to the world economy.

'Bold and beloved': Palestinians mourn teenager killed by Israel

September 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Al-Arroub, Hebron – Milad al-Raee dreamed of being famous. The 16-year-old was an avid footballer, and everyone knew he wanted to go to Spain's Santiago Bernabeu Stadium to watch his favourite team Real Madrid play. And one day, he wanted to play for them.
In the narrow streets of al-Arroub refugee camp, north of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, everyone was used to seeing Milad with his friends kicking a football around, usually wearing his Real Madrid shirt.
On September 9, as Milad made his way back to the camp after a barbecue on a nearby hill, his life was cut short by a single Israeli bullet.
According to witnesses, an Israeli soldier in a military watchtower at the entrance of the camp shot the child in the back.
He became the 47th Palestinian child to be killed by Israel this year.
'Now the group of friends is missing one'
Abdulqader Badawi, a resident of al-Arroub camp, remembers how he ran into Milad and they joked a bit, two days before the child was shot.
"The whole camp loved him," Badawi said.
"I remember him sitting in the neighbourhood with his group of friends, which is now missing one. That neighbourhood, near the women's centre and the kindergarten and leading out to the main street, down there you couldn't miss Milad, with his friends or playing football."
A promising 15-year-old Palestinian, Milad Al-Raee, dreamt of playing football and visiting Santiago Bernabu Stadium to watch Real Madrid.

- Chris Hutchinson (@ChrisHu34451470) September 10, 2023
The researcher at the Palestinian Forum for Israeli Studies (MADAR) added that the presence of the military watchtower had been a point of friction for many years.
"There is no space in the camp to play, because space is limited and people and houses are packed in tight," he told Al Jazeera.
"Milad and his friends would just play in the street, it was occupied by the Israelis but this did not prevent them from playing football every day, a few metres away from the military tower."
The tower was erected ostensibly to protect the movement of the army and Jewish settlers surrounding the camp.
'Beautiful, warm voice'
Milad was the second of three brothers, and a music lover who learned about it from his father. While his dad sang national and folkloric songs, Milad was more into rap music and wrote his own raps in Arabic.
"My voice is loud, my time is precious, that's why I dream of flying," he once wrote.
Noor al-Sharif, Milad's maternal uncle, described his nephew as a "bold, beloved, and extremely sociable boy".
Milad, who grew up knowing only occupation, dreamed of liberating Palestine and returning refugees to their homes, al-Sharif said.
"Everyone knew him in the camp," he said. "We lost a beautiful, warm voice that sang with love about the homeland, the future, and hope.
"He was passionate about his voice and singing … The last time I saw him was a few days ago in our house, and he sang for us, songs about homeland and the right of return."
It was also known that, like many boys who grew up with the frustration of an occupation that essentially denied them their futures and their families their ancestral homes, Milad looked up to Palestinian armed resistance fighters as heroic figures, especially those who died in battle.
"Milad was greatly influenced by Mateen Dabaya from the Jenin camp," said Badawi, referring to the   local commander of the Jenin Brigades who was killed last year in an Israeli raid.
Munther al-Sharif, Milad's 46-year-old father, was at the barber's when he got a call that Milad was injured.
"I rushed to the clinic and found medics trying to resuscitate him," he said. "I looked into his eyes and I knew he was gone."
Milad had achieved the martyrdom he had so admired, his father said.
In his last post on Facebook, Milad wrote: "One martyr after the other … maybe we are next."
More than 230 Palestinians have been killed by Israel this year alone, in what the United Nations said has been the deadliest year for them since the world body began counting Palestinian casualties in 2005.

'Explosive bullet'
Thaer al-Sharif, a journalist and al-Arroub camp resident whose home is near the entrance, said the Israeli soldier fired deliberately at Milad with the intent to kill.
According to witness accounts, Milad walked a few metres down the road after they heard the sound of the bullet. He collapsed a few minutes later.
"There was no blood on the street," al-Sharif said.
Doctors confirmed later that Milad had been killed by a "  ", an explosive bullet that shatters upon impact, pulverising tissue, arteries and bone while causing severe internal injuries.
That was why he did not collapse immediately or bleed where he was shot.
"The doctors informed us that Milad had internal bleeding, his lungs and organs in the chest area were lacerated, and there was no exit wound for the bullet."
Wafa, the Palestinian official news agency, reported that Israeli forces had fired 'live bullets and tear gas canisters at several young men and children'. Witnesses say they heard what sounded like one Molotov cocktail at the same moment they saw Milad get shot.
The Israeli military claimed 'terrorists hurled Molotov cocktails' at soldiers at a military post adjacent to the camp.
'The soldiers responded with riot dispersal means and live fire. A hit was identified,' it said.
The Palestinian Ministry of Education said: "Milad wanted to play for Real Madrid, but the bullets of the Israeli occupation did not give him the opportunity to achieve his dream."

EU leaders call for 'humanitarian pauses', aid corridors in besieged Gaza

European Union leaders have called for   in the fighting between Israel and the armed Palestinian group Hamas as the Gaza Strip reels under an Israeli bombardment and siege.
Leaders at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday issued a declaration calling for a halt to the fighting to establish humanitarian corridors and get   into Gaza.
"The European Council expresses its gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and calls for continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs," the declaration said.
The declaration was made as criticism grows from around the Middle East about Israel's campaign of air raids and a "complete siege", which has cut off access to food, water, electricity and fuel for the strip's 2.3 million inhabitants.
The summit on Thursday is the first in-person meeting since Hamas carried out attacks on October 7 on southern Israel, which killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
The assault by Hamas has been widely condemned with   emerging from towns in southern Israel where Palestinian gunmen massacred families and kidnapped more than 200 people.
The EU leaders reiterated previous calls for the immediate release of those   'without any precondition' and emphasised Israel's right to defend itself 'in line with international law'.
But such statements, similar to others made by the United States, have rung hollow to some as Israel carries out   that have levelled entire neighbourhoods and killed more than 7,000 people in Gaza, some in zones where Israel had told Palestinians to move to seek safety.
In the Middle East, protesters have criticised Israel's allies  .
In the US, Palestinian groups expressed outrage when President   reacted to the death toll in Gaza by casting doubt on the reliability of the figures provided by the Ministry of Health in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas.
Health services in Gaza have been stretched to their limits as Israel's siege chokes off access to much-needed medical supplies and doctors work under the light of phones as   run out.
Over the past week, a   has begun delivering aid to Gaza through the strip's crossing with Egypt, the only remaining point of exit and entry.
However, the supply of aid has been neither consistent nor adequate to address the scope of civilian suffering with United Nations chief Antonio Guterres calling the efforts a 'drop of aid in an ocean of need'.

Who is Rashida Tlaib, why was the Palestinian-American lawmaker censured?

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The US House of Representatives on Tuesday   its sole Palestinian-American lawmaker, Rashida Tlaib, for her comments on the Israel-Hamas war.
The resolution, which was backed by some 22 members of her Democratic party, claimed Tlaib had been 'promoting false narratives" regarding the October 7 Hamas attack inside Israel that killed more than 1,400 people. She was also accused of seeking "destruction of Israel" – a charge she rejected.
So, who is Rashida Tlaib, why exactly was she "censured", what does that mean, and what happened in the tense meeting that culminated in a resolution being passed against her?
Why was the Palestinian-American Congresswoman censured?
The rare vote found a problem with the Democrat congresswoman's embrace of the slogan "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free" – a pro-Palestine chant that has drawn scrutiny from Israel and its supporters in the West.
It claimed the slogan 'is widely recognised as a genocidal call to violence to destroy the state of Israel and its people'.
Tlaib has defended the slogan saying it was an "aspirational call for freedom… and peaceful existence and not death, destruction and hate".
During the debate she along with her progressive colleagues in the House reiterated a call for a ceasefire as the Israeli military offensive has killed over 10,000 Palestinians, many of them children, in one month.
'Palestinian people are not disposable,' an emotional Tlaib said.
Tlaib has been a vocal critic of the Israeli government for its treatment of Palestinians and had previously called for an end to Washington's aid for Israel, including $3.8bn in annual military assistance.
She has lambasted the Israeli bombardment of Gaza that has overwhelmingly killed civilians, but she has also repeatedly condemned the deadly attack by the Hamas armed group.
But her use of the word "resistance" in the wake of the Hamas attack was highlighted by the politicians who introduced the resolution. She had argued that 'suffocating, dehumanising conditions' in the Palestinian territories could 'lead to resistance'.
Who is Rashida Tlaib?
The 47-year-old Democrat politician and lawyer is a three-term Democrat congresswoman and currently serves as the representative for Michigan's 12th congressional district.
She is the first woman of Palestinian descent in Congress and, alongside Ilhan Oman, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress.
Tlaib and Omar are a member of 'The Squad', an informal group of progressive members of Congress that includes Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez among others.
She was born in Detroit to working-class Palestinian immigrants and still has family in the West Bank occupied by Israel.

What does it mean to be censured?
Passing a censure resolution against a member of Congress is a serious form of formal public admonishment that is seen as a punishment of last resort and is one step below expulsion. But it has been recently used with more frequency and in partisan ways.
Tlaib had avoided censure in another resolution last week filed by Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, who had accused her of 'leading an insurrection' on Capitol Hill for speaking at a pro-Palestinian rally.
The 47-year-old lawmaker became the second member of the body to be censured this year, after Adam Schiff from the Democrat party, who in June had a resolution passed against him over Republican grievances for his handling of the Trump-Russia investigation.
Historically speaking, a censure is a rare move, with Congress only having censured 25 members before Tlaib during its entire history.
The first censure dates back to 1832 when a congressman was censured over insulting the speaker during a floor debate.
Ilhan Omar   - but not censured - in February, when Republicans voted for a resolution to remove her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee over her criticism of Israel.
The political divisions
A considerable number of Democrats voted against Tlaib, while a handful of Republicans voted in her favour, displaying political divisions over the sensitive issue.
The final vote was 234 to 188, and 22 House Democrats, including Jim Costa of California and four representatives from Florida, voted to censure Tlaib. Three Democrats and one Republican voted present. Four Republicans voted against the resolution, largely on grounds of freedom of speech.
Jewish Democrat Brad Schneider, who voted against Tlaib, said he recognises her right to freely express and views censure as imperfect, 'but unfortunately it is the only vehicle available to formally rebuke the dangerous disinformation and aspersions' that Tlaib uses.
Democrat Jamie Raskin, who defended Tlaib, said the resolution degrades the US Constitution and 'cheapens the meaning of discipline in this body for people who actually commit wrongful actions like bribery, fraud, violent assault and so on'.
I am the only Palestinian American serving in Congress, and my perspective is needed here now more than ever. I will not be silenced and I will not let anyone distort my words.
I'm from Detroit, where I learned to speak truth to power, even if my voice shakes. pic.twitter.com/bXhGPCcKat
- Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (@RepRashida) November 7, 2023
In a speech for the representatives, Tlaib defended herself by saying she 'will not be silenced and I will not let you distort my words'.
She said her criticism has always been directed toward the government of Israel and its leadership under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, not against Jewish people.
'The idea that criticising the government of Israel is anti-Semitic sets a very dangerous precedent. And it's been used to silence diverse voices speaking up for human rights across our nation,' she said.

'We have nothing': Families seek safety from bombs inside Gaza hospitals

November 4th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
As bombs rain down upon neighbourhoods and refugee camps in Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian families are setting up temporary homes in an unlikely place:  .
Tents are popping up in hospital corridors, parking lots and courtyards, as families seek safety in and around medical facilities — places that should be protected under international humanitarian law.
It is only the latest sign of the new reality as the Israel-Hamas war reaches its 29th day on Saturday, with growing fears of medical supply shortages and explosions disrupting the vital health services unfolding at hospitals and clinics.
With only cloth walls for privacy, families inside the tents are going about their daily routines, sleeping, eating and trying to reestablish a sense of normalcy.
These tents began to appear only days after the war broke out on October 7. Not only do they serve as temporary shelter for those escaping death and destruction in residential areas, but some also act as makeshift surgeries and emergency rooms as the Palestinian death toll soars past 9,000.

Women and children comprise a mass majority of the hospital inhabitants. Privacy is a distant memory, and the challenges of living in a hospital are manifold. Food, clean water and toilet facilities are severely rationed and available only sporadically: once or twice a day.
A seven-member family sheltering in a tent spoke anonymously to Al Jazeera about their hardship. They mentioned that they lack protection from the nearby shelling and the debris it raises, as well as from the biting cold at night.
"Overnight, from having everything, we now have nothing,' one of the family members said.
Families like theirs also face the heightened possibilities of infection and contact with toxic chemicals, as medical treatment continues in other tents nearby.

A lack of medical supplies
Health facilities across Gaza have reported shortages of medical supplies. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the scarcity has become a grave problem for both medical personnel and patients, causing the quality of healthcare to deteriorate rapidly.
The shortage of anaesthesia has become glaringly apparent at the  , the biggest health facility in Gaza, established in 1946. Doctors there are reportedly forced to perform surgery on patients without medicine to dull their pain, causing them indescribable agony.
Intensive care units or ICUs, meanwhile, have too few beds to accommodate the hundreds of patients with severe injuries. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, spaces for such cases have been exhausted since mid-October.
The Indonesian Hospital, serving over 150,000 residents in northern Gaza, is on the brink of ceasing its operations, raising alarm among health officials.
The Al-Shifa Hospital is also on the verge of a complete shutdown. The hospital, which provides critical health services to central Gaza, may soon be unable to admit more patients or treat injuries.
With only 546 beds, it is now treating over 1,000 injured people. The hospital has even resorted to conducting surgery in its yards, using the sun to light the medical procedures due to the lack of electricity and fuel.
"The hospital is expected to go completely dark within hours," Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the Health Ministry, warned on Wednesday.
An additional 50,000 to 60,000 people are taking shelter in the hospital's yards.
Al-Qudra said that Gaza's health sector faces catastrophe unless fuel and medical supplies reach the besieged enclave. He called   to facilitate the urgent delivery of medical aid to Gaza.
On October 21,   with health supplies and other necessary goods crossed into Gaza from Egypt for the first time, beginning the flow of humanitarian assistance.
But aid has been  , in part due to ongoing Israeli bombing in the border area.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health has said as well that the international aid allocated for Gaza's health sector barely covers its essential operations and falls short of its most dire needs.

Health facilities facing bomb blasts
Attacks on or near medical facilities and workers have also dealt a severe blow to Gaza's healthcare system since the war began.
Palestinian officials have blamed Israeli air strikes for explosions at several healthcare centres, including the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in the south and the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in central Gaza City, resulting in hundreds of deaths.
Israel's military has also acknowledged striking ambulances, alleging that one of the vehicles   was 'being used by a Hamas terrorist cell'. Al-Qudra said 'a big number' of health workers were killed in the blast.
An estimated 25 ambulances have been hit, and 136 healthcare workers killed, since the start of the war.
The Health Ministry and Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) have called for medical facilities and first responders to be protected from the violence, in accordance with  .
Article 18 of the Geneva Convention specifies that civilian hospitals should 'in no circumstances be the object of attack'. Medical transport is likewise protected under humanitarian law.
Nevertheless, medical institutions in Gaza have continued to  . On October 29, PRCS said it received a notification from Israeli forces to evacuate the   in the Tal al-Hawa area of Gaza City, ahead of a planned bombing there.
The hospital housed hundreds of patients and an estimated 12,000 displaced Palestinians.
The Government Media Office in Gaza and the Health Ministry have characterised such attacks as "war crimes', calling for accountability.
Exhaustion among health workers
The continued violence has also increased concerns for the mental and physical wellbeing of healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, administrative staff and rescue crews.
Working around the clock, some are facing extreme exhaustion. Others are suffering psychological fatigue from treating gruesome injuries or the frustration of lacking resources.
"Before the war, we would be responsible for alleviating the stress and trauma of the sick and injured, but now it is us who need an outlet for our exhausted bodies and spirits," said nurse Huda Shokry from the Al-Daraj Medical Complex.
Still, Dr Ahmed Ghoul, an emergency room supervisor at Al-Daraj, told Al Jazeera that the professionals he works with are dedicated to caring for their patients.
"Despite the shortage of nearly everything necessary to effectively do our jobs, we do not leave our rooms, day or night, except for quick toilet breaks,' he said.
"We have lost track of the days of the week because we are more concerned with the thousands of injured individuals than over time.'
Doctors like Ghoul have no place to sleep even if they have the chance to. Their personal rooms have been converted into patient treatment areas, and their beds are used for surgery and emergency care.
Hospital kitchens, meanwhile, have largely stopped functioning. They lack the basic resources to prepare meals for staff or patients.
"We have grown weary of what we have been witnessing," Shokry told Al Jazeera. "Being a doctor in the war in Gaza means losing one's sense of fear and exhaustion.'
"It is impossible to maintain a normal psyche or even emotions.'

Deadly explosion hits Gaza rally marking 2005 Israel pullout

At least five Palestinians have been killed and 25 others wounded in an explosion next to the separation fence along the Israeli frontier with Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health in the Gaza Strip.
The cause of the blast was not immediately known.
Wednesday's explosion took place during a demonstration along the fence marking the anniversary of Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005. The event on Gaza's eastern border was organised by Hamas, the Palestinian group that has governed the territory since 2007.
The demonstrators said Israeli soldiers fired tear gas before the deadly blast.
Witnesses told local media that when a Palestinian Explosives Engineering Unit was trying to defuse an explosive device, Israeli forces opened fire, preventing them from escaping the blast.
The Israeli army, which has carried out several spells of deadly bombing on the besieged enclave, denied involvement. It said that demonstrators were trying to throw a bomb over the fence when the device detonated. It released an aerial video showing a blast along the fence. Debris flew into the air, and several people could be seen running away.
Earlier in the day, participants held Palestinian flags and burned tyres to celebrate the anniversary of Israel's withdrawal.
Suhail al-Hindi, a Hamas leader, praised the end of what he described as "this cruel Israeli occupation from Gaza".
The enclave of two million people has remained under Israeli land, sea and air blockade with tight control over the movement of people and goods.
Israel has justified the harsh measures saying it is needed to keep Hamas from arming.

UN chief Guterres says aid trickling into Gaza is 'completely inadequate'

United Nations chief   has said that humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza are 'completely inadequate' amid deteriorating conditions within the Gaza Strip.
In a statement on Tuesday, Guterres reiterated that humanitarian need in Gaza is far outpacing existing levels of assistance. Aid trucks have been trickling into Gaza from Egypt over the past week via Rafah, the main crossing that does not border Israel.
Prior to the war, some 500 trucks carrying aid and other goods entered Gaza every day.
White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday that 66 trucks of humanitarian assistance entered Gaza in the last 24 hours. Officials would like to reach up to 100 a day, Kirby said.
Guterres also voiced concern over military escalation as Israel steps up   in Gaza and continues to bombard the besieged territory.
'I am deeply alarmed by the intensification of the conflict between Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza,' Guterres said.
'With too many Israeli and Palestinian lives already lost, this escalation only increases the immense suffering of civilians.'
Gaza a 'graveyard for thousands of children'
The comments come as Israel continues its relentless bombardment of Gaza,   that are inundated with the wounded and stretched to the breaking point by an Israeli siege that has severely restricted supplies of water, fuel, and electricity.
Palestinian authorities have said that more than 8,500 people have been killed in Gaza, more than a third of them children, since the war erupted on October 7.
In a statement on Tuesday, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) spokesperson James Elder said Gaza   'a graveyard for thousands of children'.
An Israeli air raid on Tuesday levelled an entire section of the  , killing scores of people and injuring more than 100 others, according to the Gaza health ministry. The director of the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza told Al Jazeera that more than 50 people were killed.
Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson from the Palestine Red Crescent Society, called the situation 'absolutely horrific'.
'Hospitals are already overwhelmed, and they barely can deal with the increasing number of casualties they are dealing with every single hour,' Farsakh told Al Jazeera.
'[They] are working on full capacity. This comes at the same time all hospitals are literally collapsing due to shortages [of] medical supplies as well as medicines, and they are running out of fuel, which is urgently needed'.
Speaking before the UN Security Council on Tuesday, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi urged the council to push for a ceasefire in order to end a 'spiral of death'.
The United States has thus far backed Israel and rejected  , saying that an end in the fighting would benefit Hamas, which carried out a deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7 that Israeli authorities say killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
"We do believe that we have to consider things like humanitarian pauses to make sure that assistance can get to those who need it and people can be protected and get out of harm's way," US Secretary of State   said at a congressional hearing.
Speaking last week,   called the small amounts of aid being allowed into Gaza from the Rafah crossing with Egypt 'a drop of aid in an ocean of need'.

Impeding aid to Gaza could be crime under ICC jurisdiction, says prosecutor

The International Criminal Court's Prosecutor Karim Khan told a news conference in the Egyptian capital Cairo on Sunday that Israel must make "discernible efforts" to ensure civilians get basic food and medicine.
In a video statement posted earlier on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Khan warned that curtailment of those rights could give rise to 'criminal responsibility' under the Rome Statute.
'There should not be any impediment to humanitarian relief supplies going to children, to women and men, civilians,' Khan said in the video from the Rafah border crossing with Egypt.
'They are innocent, they have rights under international humanitarian law,' Khan added. 'These rights are part of the Geneva Conventions, and they give rise to even criminal responsibility when these rights are curtailed under the Rome Statute.'
The prosecutor also said he hopes to visit the Gaza Strip and Israel while he is in the region, as his "office is determined we make sure to vindicate those rights wherever possible and wherever we have jurisdiction'.
Aid supplies to Gaza have been minimal since Israel began bombarding the densely populated Palestinian enclave on October 7 after a deadly Hamas attack. Shortly afterward, Israel imposed a total siege on the territory, cutting off its residents from electricity, water, and food supplies.
Earlier this week, Oxfam said  Israel is using 'starvation as a weapon of war' in Gaza, noting that since the war began, Gaza has received only 2 percent of the food it normally would have seen delivered.
Aid trucks started trickling into the Gaza Strip from the Rafah crossing with Egypt on October 21, but aid agencies have called that a "  ".
'Active investigations'
Khan said the court has 'active investigations ongoing' in relation to 'crimes allegedly committed in Israel on October 7, and also in relation to Gaza and the West Bank in our jurisdiction, going back to 2014'.
'We are independently looking at the situation in Palestine, we are looking at events in Israel and the allegations that Palestinian nationals have also committed crimes,' Khan said.
At least 8,005 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since the war began. In Israel, more than 1,400 people have been killed, mostly in the Hamas attack of October 7.
Israel, which is not a member of the ICC, has previously rejected the court's jurisdiction and does not formally engage with the court.
The ICC's founding Rome Statute gives it legal authority to investigate alleged crimes on the territory of its members or by their nationals, when domestic authorities are "unwilling or unable" to do so.
On October 10, the office of the prosecutor of the ICC said  its mandate applies to potential crimes committed in the current conflict.

'Beautiful solidarity': Cooking for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza

Khan Younis, Gaza – On the pavement outside Jamil Abu Assi's home in the southern Gaza town of Bani Suhaila east of Khan Younis, the 31-year-old and his cousins are busy cooking large cauldrons of food.
Abu Assi once cooked home meals based on requests from people. But after an Israeli air raid destroyed his kitchen during the 2014Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip, he shifted gears.
His family still cooks, but now specifically with the aim of helping those who have been displaced by Israel's attacks and siege on Gaza. It's a mission that's being tested like never before.
According to the United Nations, one million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been internally displaced since Israel began bombarding the territory on October 7. The blockaded enclave's total population is 2.3 million. Many have moved to the south of the Strip following repeated warnings from the Israeli military to leave the north.
Every day, the family cooks 2,000 meals that feed some of those who have arrived in Khan Younis, swelling the southern city's population to more than half a million from about 220,000 in 2021.
'I start my morning searching for wood because we do not have cooking gas," he told Al Jazeera, referring to the complete blockade on fuel supplies to Gaza enforced by Israel since October 7. But some days, fetching wood is risky, he said, given the town's  . On Sunday, the Palestinian armed group Hamas — which governs the Gaza Strip — said it had pushed back an attempted Israeli raid into the Khan Younis area, in which an  .
"I don't want to put myself in danger," Abu Assi said.

'We try to do our part'
Abu Assi and his cousins have divided up their roles to be more efficient. One person is tasked with chopping onions, another with adding ingredients and stirring the pot, and a third with wrapping and packaging the meals.
Most of the   include rice, lentils and freekeh, a cereal prepared by roasting green grain. Meat was previously a staple, but is now harder to get as many butchers have closed their shops after being damaged by Israeli bombs and amid a lack of supplies.
Many Palestinians who have moved to southern Gaza have taken shelter at schools run by the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) — the UN agency for Palestinian refugees — believing those to be relatively safer spaces. Others are staying in cramped conditions with host families and communities. Some left the north with only the clothes on their backs, others with small backpacks.
"The schools are hardly places of refuge," he said. "They are cemeteries for the living, without the basic necessities of life. We try to do our part, however small, in alleviating this crisis for the people."
Israel's devastating bombing campaign followed a surprise Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7, leading to 1,400 people's deaths. The Israeli bombardment of Gaza has since flattened entire neighbourhoods, and killed more than 4,600 Palestinians in 16 days, including 1,873 children and 1,023 women.
Yet, to Abu Assi — as to Palestinians across Gaza, Israel and the occupied West Bank — the latest aggression is only a reminder of a personal history.
 
At least 2,000 meals are cooked every day [Yaser Qudeih/Al Jazeera]
'Beautiful social solidarity'
Abu Assi is a third-generation refugee originally from Jaffa, where his grandparents were displaced in 1948 during what Palestinians refer to as the  . More than 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly evicted from their lands and homes, some 500 towns and villages were destroyed, and thousands were killed in a process of ethnic cleansing carried out by Jewish militias and the military of the then-nascent Israeli state.
"Our grandfather told us that being a refugee is very hard to take, and that this bitterness will never be forgotten and is handed down to each generation," Abu Assi recalled. "The pain in our hearts will never make us forgive Israel for what it has done and continues to do to us."
The children affected by the war this time around will never be able to forget surviving without food, water or electricity, he said.
But amid the terror and trauma of missiles and the siege, a community has come together.Some people have approached the Abu Assi family to see if they too could also donate food to displaced Palestinians.
"There is a beautiful social solidarity in the city of Khan Younis," Abu Assi said. "We cannot accept hungry people not being able to find food, so there has been this organic cooperation to make sure that initiative continues to operate."

'Feel safe among the people'
To accommodate the food needs of the rising displaced population that Khan Younis is hosting, Abu Assi has increased the number of cooking burners and divided the work among two teams.
Meal preparation starts at seven in the morning, and the cooking goes on until 2pm.
"We cannot leave our workplaces, but we told those who need food to come from two in the afternoon until 5pm," Abu Assi said.
"Some citizens volunteer to distribute meals in their cars to the displaced, which is a nice gesture as many of the displaced do not have means of transportation nor know the area very well.'
Some families are grateful even just for rice — often for their only meal of the day.
Karama Musallam, a 40-year-old mother of five, was looking for food when she came upon the Abu Assi family.
Her family, including her 80-year-old mother-in-law, fled their home in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoon at the start of the war. They are staying at UNRWA school in Bani Suhaila.
Musallam does not know anyone or have relatives in and around Khan Younis.
"When I went out to look for food, I found these young men cooking and they gave me two meals so that it would be enough for my children," she said.
"They told me that I could come every day and take whatever meals available,' she added. "That is why I felt safe among the people."
"We are all one community."

Family celebrates return of freed Palestinian prisoner Marah Bakeer

Jerusalem – With tears of joy rolling down her cheeks, and a look of utter disbelief, Sawsan Bakeer ran down a flight of steps to greet her 24-year-old daughter, Marah, who had just been released after eight years in an Israeli prison.
Marah Bakeer is one of 39 Palestinian women and children released from Israeli prisons on Friday in exchange for 13 Hamas captives under a   that includes a four-day truce in Gaza.
'I told you Marah is beautiful,' Sawsan told journalists, as she hugged her daughter and showered her with endless kisses. 'Not because she's my daughter, really, but Marah is beautiful, and you got to see for yourself.'
Before her imprisonment, Bakeer was a 16-year-old high school student at al-Maimouna School in occupied East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood.
Every day, she would make her way from the family home in Beit Hanina to school, crossing an expressway that runs between East and West Jerusalem.
While on her way home on October 12, 2015, Israeli forces shot and arrested her for allegedly attempting to stab an Israeli officer. Bakeer and her family deny the accusations.
When she was arrested, Bakeer was lying on the pavement with 12 gunshot wounds to her arm and hand which have left her with permanent damage. She was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison.
A child when imprisoned, Bakeer was due to complete her sentence and return home in four months' time.
'I needed my mother's love'
Newly freed, Bakeer told Al Jazeera that her time in prison was hard, but that she had endured it with her faith in God and the support of her family and fellow Palestinian prisoners.
'There were many difficult times in prison, but just like anyone else going through life, they passed.
'Prison was especially difficult because I was young [when I was jailed] and I needed my mother's love and my family's support.
'Although there were many fellow prisoners who took care of me and helped me, nothing can replace a mother's love,' she said as Sawsan held onto her.
About 8,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli jails, including 3,000 who have been detained over the past seven weeks amid an increasing number of armed Israeli raids across the West Bank.
Over the next four days, 150 Palestinian prisoners and 50 Israeli hostages are to be freed.

Solitary confinement before release
Over the years of her imprisonment, Bakeer has become something of a political figure, representing all female prisoners before the administration at Damon prison in northern Israel, where female Palestinian prisoners and minors are detained.
Following the  , Israel moved Bakeer, along with other prison leaders, to another prison, in Jalame, and placed her in solitary confinement.
For more than six weeks, she was not permitted to communicate with her fellow inmates nor receive any information from the outside world.
'It was a very difficult time because they kept me away from the rest, and it was during the war. I didn't know what was happening to them and that really affected me,' she told Al Jazeera.
'What was even harder, was that I didn't know anything about my family. But I knew God would protect them,' she added.
Bakeer was taken out of her cell on Wednesday but says she was not told what was happening.
'When I didn't go back to my cell, I knew there was a deal being negotiated, but I had no idea what the details were,' she explained.
She was only informed on Friday morning that she was going to be leaving prison.
No celebrations, Israel orders families
Ahead of Bakeer's release, her family said they did not have any information about when she would be coming home until Israeli forces stormed their home and asked all relatives and guests to leave. They warned against any show of joy or celebration upon Bakeer's arrival, the family said.
Bakeer's father, Jawdat, was taken for questioning at a police station in Jerusalem and warned against the family showing any signs of joy about Marah's release.
'Marah came home to us today. We've just received her but they [Israeli forces] threatened to storm the house and arrest me if we celebrate,' he told Al Jazeera.
Israeli forces also blocked all entry to the neighbourhood where Bakeer's family home is located. They have stationed soldiers in front of the house, ensuring no groups can gather.
Qadura Fares, who heads the Palestinian Prisoners' Club NGO, said 33 prisoners were freed in the West Bank and handed over to a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross, while six others were released in Jerusalem.
The NGO said in a statement that the Israeli government set several conditions forbidding the released prisoners and their families from speaking to the press, receiving guests at home or distributing sweets in celebration. Those who do not abide by the rules could be fined about 70,000 shekels ($18,740), the NGO added.
Although Bakeer is happy to be home, she told Al Jazeera that her happiness was incomplete with the continuing bloodshed in Gaza.
'I'm very happy of course, but I feel devastated by how that deal was reached at the cost of our brothers' and sisters' lives in Gaza."
More than 14,800 people have been killed in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the official death toll from Hamas's attacks stands at about 1,200.

Tunisia debates bill to criminalise normalisation of ties with Israel

November 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Tunisian parliament has started debating a bill that would criminalise any normalisation of ties with Israel as the bombardment of Gaza intensifies and the death toll surpassed 9,000.
The draft, on which deliberations started on Thursday, defines "normalisation" as "recognition of the Zionist entity or the establishment of direct or indirect ties" with it, a crime that would be classed as "high treason".
Anyone found guilty of "the crime of normalisation" could face six to 10 years in prison and a fine of 10,000 to 100,000 dinars ($3,155 to $31,553), the text says. Repeat offenders could be handed life sentences.
In addition, the bill would ban any interaction between Tunisians and Israelis, including at "events, demonstrations, meetings, exhibitions and competitions" in any context, be they "political, economic, scientific, cultural, artistic or sporting" in territory held or occupied by Israel.
'Total agreement'
The proposal to outlaw ties with Israel appeared widely popular in parliament and among the public, lawmakers said.
"There is total agreement between the president, the parliament and public opinion" on this issue, parliamentary speaker Brahim Bouderbala told deputies as the session kicked off.
"We strongly believe Palestine must be liberated   … and that a Palestinian state must be established with holy Jerusalem as its capital," he said.
The legislation was drafted in late October by a group of lawmakers who back President Kais Saied, an independent law professor who was elected to office in 2019.
Saied has shored up power and   on his opponents after launching a   that ousted the former parliament and prime minister. Tunisia's new parliament was   in January and has 160 deputies.
Saied has been a staunch advocate of the Palestinian cause since entering the political scene, saying  it is "Tunisia's duty to stand by the Palestinian people" and that anyone who normalises ties with Israel is a "traitor".
His sentiments appear to be shared by a large swathe of Tunisians, who have taken to the streets in the thousands to voice their support for Palestinians and denounce Israeli attacks on Gaza since the war broke out.
More than 9,000 Palestinians, including over 3,600 children, have been   in Gaza since Israel began pounding the enclave in response to Hamas's surprise attacks on Israel on October 7. Hamas's attacks killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, Israeli authorities said.
Ancient Jewish community
Tunisia has a small Jewish community, numbering about 1,000, most of whom live in closed-off quarters on the southern island of  .
Their oldest synagogue, El Ghriba, is the site of an annual Jewish pilgrimage that brings thousands to the island every May from around the world.
This year, a Tunisian naval guardsmen attacked the holy site during the pilgrimage, firing bullets outside the synagogue, killing five people, including two Jewish worshippers.
A symbol of Tunisia's Jewish heritage was again targeted on October 17 when a crowd of protesters enraged by the bloodshed in Gaza torched an empty Jewish synagogue that houses the shrine of a 16th century rabbi in the city of El Hamma in the Gabes governorate.

What's behind the Arab-Islamic ministerial tour of UNSC states?

November 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Beirut, Lebanon – A delegation of Islamic and Arab nations are on a tour of the five permanent United Nations Security Council member states.
Their stated goal is to bring a ceasefire to the war on Gaza, allow more humanitarian aid to reach the people there and ask the five council members to support the Palestinians in achieving an independent state.
But experts are divided on the efficacy and format of this trip.
'The impression of activity'?
The delegation, formed at a summit of the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Riyadh, includes representatives from Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Nigeria, the Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the secretary-general of the OIC. It rejects Israel's claim that its assault on Gaza is in self-defence.
On October 7, Hamas attacks in southern Israel killed about 1,200 people. About 240 people were taken captive. Since then, Israel has killed more than 14,500 Palestinians. At least 6,000 were children.
The delegation has a packed schedule and started its tour in China, where it met with Wang Yi, China's top diplomat, on Monday in Beijing.
Starting with China surprised analysts who speculated on what the delegation was trying to signal to Western powers. Some were less concerned with that and questioned the delegation's true agenda.
'In diplomacy, it is a well-known strategy: When you don't want to do anything, try to involve the maximum of actors," Gerard Araud, former French ambassador to Israel, posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. "It takes time, it gives the impression of activity and it is useless."
Shortly after the delegation began its visit, talk of a humanitarian pause gathered steam, and early on Wednesday, it as announced. The deal was a major talking point for the delegation, and they pushed for a more lasting cessation of hostilities.
The agreement would see Hamas release about 50 women and children for three times as many Palestinian female and child prisoners in Israeli jails.
The announced duration of the pause is four days, over which the captives will be released. Israel also said it would halt fighting for one more day for every 'extra' batch of 10 captives Hamas releases.
The meeting in China was followed by one with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday and the UK's foreign secretary, David Cameron, later in London. Wednesday saw a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.
First stop, China
By starting their trip in China, the Islamic and Arab states may be trying to gather global support to present to nations that have backed Israel so far.
During the meeting, Wang said China being chosen as the first stop is an indication that the countries of the delegation trust China and appreciate the mutual understanding between them.

Robert Mogielnicki, an expert at Georgetown University on Chinese relations with Middle Eastern and North African countries, does not consider the efforts by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states performative as Araud does.
'Arab states do not have a tremendous degree of direct leverage. Indirect influence through shaping the global narrative and impacting public stances of key global players seem to be an important dimension of their efforts,' he said.
China seemed to welcome the diplomacy with Wang telling the delegation: 'China has always firmly supported the just cause of the Palestinian people to restore their legitimate national rights and interests,' according to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
'China has an interest in regional order and preventing economic turbulence,' Arang Keshavarzian, an associate professor of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at New York University, told Al Jazeera.
'I can only assume these leaders are genuinely trying to get China more involved to help end the war, but the reality is that only the US has the necessary leverage over Israel.'
'Message to the US'
In August, China brokered a peace deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which re-established their diplomatic ties and had analysts saying it was a sign that the Middle East was turning away from the United States as a major ally.
'China being the first destination visited is a message to the United States,' Randa Slim, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera. Saudi Arabia and other Arab states are telling the US, 'you are no longer the sole power in the region,' she explained.
Beijing recently also strengthened its relations with non-Western multilateral groups like BRICS, in which it is a member along with four other large emerging economies, and built stronger ties with the Global South in what analysts said are efforts to build a more multipolar world order.
The Saudi-Iran deal was a 'diplomatic win for China as it increasingly seeks to present an alternative vision to the US-led global order', according to a report  by the US Institute of Peace.
Abraham Accords or bust?
Arab leaders have complained about US disengagement from the region in recent years. Its policy has largely focused on following former President Donald Trump's strategy of pushing the Abraham Accords, normalisation agreements between Israel and Arab countries.
Arab leaders – Egypt and Saudi Arabia in particular – recently warned  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that this strategy has contributed to instability in the region.
Before October 7, it was widely reported that Saudi Arabia and Israel were on track to normalise relations as well. The deal would have been a major coup for Israel, who, analysts said, has been looking to circumvent working with Palestinians by building agreements with regional powers instead.
Popular mobilisation in support of Palestinians over the past six weeks, particularly in the Middle East, 'upended' the 'regional dynamics underpinning normalisation processes', Mogielnicki said.
However, he added: 'The underlying strategic calculations that have supported past normalisation-related efforts are unlikely to disappear entirely.'
Public perception of the US as a staunch ally of Israel – despite Blinken and other US officials highlighting policies like restoring aid to Palestinians  that the Trump administration had cut – may not change.
Even if Arab states are under no illusion about where the US stands, the visit to China does not indicate a complete loss of faith just yet.
'This is part of efforts to galvanize global support and increase pressure on the Israeli government,' Mogielnicki said.
Regardless of how frustrated they are with the unflinching US support for Israel, Arab leaders know the power to stop the carnage rests with the US.
'If you want to achieve the objective of getting a ceasefire, you need to speak to the Americans,' Slim said. 'They are the only party [who decides].'

Q&A: Former UN expert stresses Israel's occupation of Gaza never ended

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC – US Secretary of State   has become the latest United States government official to warn Israel that it cannot "reoccupy Gaza" after the war with Hamas, in response to recent comments by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Netanyahu   this week after suggesting that the Israeli military could control security in Gaza "for an indefinite period" when fighting in the besieged Palestinian enclave ends.
Israeli officials have since said Netanyahu did not mean that Israel plans to take administrative control of the Gaza Strip, but the country's intentions remain unclear amid conflicting statements by senior government leaders, including Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.
Speaking to reporters in Japan on the sidelines of a G7 meeting on Wednesday, Blinken said that "the only way to ensure that this crisis never happens again is to begin setting the conditions for durable peace and security", including "no reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends".
The Israeli government has contended that its occupation of Gaza ended in 2005, when it withdrew military forces and settlers from the enclave. But that position has been described  by Israeli rights group B'Tselem as "entirely baseless" and rejected by international law experts.
Here, Al Jazeera speaks to Michael Lynk, who until last year served as the United Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, about recent discussions around the Israeli occupation of Gaza and what could come after the war ends.
Al Jazeera: The US has said it opposes Israel's "reoccupation" of Gaza. But did the Israeli occupation of Gaza ever end?
Michael Lynk: A couple of years ago, there was a comment made on CBC Radio in Canada, which said that Gaza was no longer occupied. I and an another organisation (Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East) each sent letters in to say that  .
The test in international law is: Does the military exercise – the term is "effective control" – over the land or territory?
It's like if the guards leave the prison, but they take all the keys with them; They're still controlling how much food goes inside the prison each day and how much electricity goes into the prison each day. The people inside the prison are free to roam wherever they want within the confines of the prison but have no ability to be able to leave – that would be "effective control" over the prison.
This is the same way Israel exercises effective control over who and what leaves Gaza and who and what enters Gaza, as well.
AJ: What significance is there to the US using the term "reoccupation"?
Lynk: I suspect the US does not take the position that Gaza is occupied. I don't know if they have a coherent position at all on what the status of Gaza is now. They've accepted, probably, that Israel in leaving Gaza in 2005, formally ended that occupation.
In fact, it's very hard to find any statement from a recent Republican or   that uses the word "occupation" to describe any part of Palestine with regards to this.
So I guess I understand why they're using the word 'reoccupy', in the sense that they're talking about Israeli troops holding onto power inside of Gaza, and exercising military authority whenever the current [fighting] comes to an end.
But as I said, it's not reoccupation – it's occupation in a new form.
Al Jazeera: What differences are we seeing between the US and Israel in their views of what happens after the war in Gaza?
Lynk: What we have is a tactical debate going on between the   and Israel over what Gaza would look like immediately after hostilities wind up ending.
Israel is saying that they would probably need to remain in Gaza for some period of time. And that's probably because they want to absolutely destroy whatever they can find with respect to the military presence of Hamas.
Given Blinken's   over the last week, he recognises the intense pressure coming from the Global South in general, and in particular, as to what Gaza would look like afterwards and recognising that any kind of ongoing Israeli presence in Gaza is a non-starter.
Keep in mind that there are calls not only for the reoccupation of Gaza within Israel, but also (among some hard-right Israeli lawmakers for) the resettlement of settlers in Gaza, as well. That's an argument you may hear from the far-right-wing settler movement.
However, I suspect there are all kinds of voices within the Israeli military and Israeli military intelligence saying that that's a non-starter.
Al Jazeera: What comes next in terms of the Israeli occupation and the future of Gaza?
Lynk: There are a couple of possibilities.
One, which I think has got to be one of the lowest possibilities, is that Israel keeps its boots on the ground inside of Gaza and rules it through a direct military administration for the foreseeable future.
I think that that has very little chance of succeeding, both because I think Israeli soldiers would probably pay a high price, as they did in maintaining their occupation in Lebanon in the 1980s into the 1990s.
A second option, which I think is what the United States would prefer – and you'd probably find support from countries in the Global North – is an international administration moving in, either led by the Arab world, led by the United Nations, or some combination thereof, where there would be international troops on the ground, there would be an international fund to reconstruct Gaza.
And there would be, I guess, a serious attempt to try to build up the governance capacity to be able to provide basic services in Gaza as any national or municipal administration would wind up doing.
And that would include, I suspect, a plan to have   take over at some point.
Al Jazeera: Would any pathway lead to the end of the Israeli occupation?
Lynk: For the Palestinian Authority to come in, they themselves have a   to make.
Do they come in simply to provide stability and manage, if you like, Gaza, or is this actually a first step towards an independent Palestinian state? And I'd be fairly confident saying the Palestinian Authority would be insisting that they would not want to take over the administration of Gaza.
I think there would be great reluctance to be able to be seen to be coming into and ruling and taking over the administration of Gaza, on the back of Israeli bayonets. They'd want a guaranteed prelude to the end of the occupation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
And the difficulty with that is … if the Biden administration doesn't have the political clout to force Israel into making humanitarian pauses, let alone a ceasefire, what hope is there for the United States using political capital to force Israel – in   – to make the substantive agreements necessary to be able to create an independent Palestinian state that is contiguous, where the settlements have ended, and where the Palestinian capital is in East Jerusalem?
I think the chances of that are less than zero.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

'We went through hell': Palestinian dual citizens hoping to leave Gaza

October 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Rafah, Gaza - Nineteen-year-old Yousif Abu Shaaban and four immediate family members had been waiting for days for their evacuation from the besieged Gaza Strip through the   with Egypt.
An American passport holder, Abu Shaaban was told by officials from the United States consulate that he and his family were eligible to leave the strip. The family was staying at a school near the Rafah crossing, seeking a way out of the enclave away from Israel's relentless bombing campaign that began on October 7.
US officials had advised Gaza's Palestinian American dual citizens — who number between 500 and 600 — to move closer to the crossing for possible safe passage into Egypt.
Residents were told they had a five-hour window last Saturday to evacuate, but by the end of the day, no one made it through. A week later, they remain in limbo, unsure of when they will be able to leave — even as Israel's bombing continues, and a ground invasion of Gaza looms.
On October 21, US officials said they had received information that the crossing could be opened to allow dual citizens to leave — as the first aid trucks from Egypt entered Gaza.
But it's already too late for Abu Shaaban and his family: The delay in evacuations cost his 14-year-old sister's life.
On Thursday, after three days at the school, the family returned home to Gaza City to grab a few more of their belongings.
"It became late and we decided to sleep in the house and return to Rafah the next morning. Suddenly, we heard shelling. We went to a room on the ground floor. It was not long before our metal front door was bombed inwards, and the shelling was taking place at our doorstep."
"My sister was martyred. Who will bring her back to me?" Abu Shaaban, who also sustained injuries from shrapnel to his face, told Al Jazeera from where the family's home is located.
His 44-year-old father, who is blind, was severely injured in his arm as a result of the shelling that took place at 11pm (20:00 GMT) at night. "I am the only one sustaining my father financially. He does not move without me. He is blind, and now his entire arm is gone."
His eight-year-old sister, Jihan, was also injured.
Abu Shaaban was born in the US when his parents moved there so his father could complete a master's degree.
"This is the fault of the negligence from the embassy and all the sides that are supposed to be responsible for me. I demand an international inquiry into why this happened to me, to my house – why my sister was martyred," said Abu Shaaban. "I'm going to take them to court."
"On several days, the representatives in the American consulate would call me and tell me to come to the crossing. I would go — I would risk my life and go — from Gaza City to the border crossing," he explained.
British authorities also called on their nationals in Gaza to move south and sent them messages  telling them to be on alert in case the crossing opened. Up to 60,000 British citizens live "in Israel or Gaza," according to the BBC.

Navigating 'the danger zone'
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Rafah, another dual US citizen said last week that the situation was "hopeless" .
"I am a US citizen. My country told me to come here. We went through hell coming here. It's a war zone going from the middle of Gaza all the way to the border of Gaza. And now we're going home empty-handed," he said.
"We don't know what's going on, why we were told to come, and when we are going to get out of here."
The man said he had a message for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken: "If we were Israelis, would this happen to us? American Israelis already left. They leave every day.
"Palestinian Americans cannot leave. Neither can Palestinians of other citizenships, which are plenty here. They all have women, children, elderly people. They can't keep travelling through the danger zone to get to the border," he continued.
"One single shell could kill us."
At least 4,137Palestinians, including more than 1,500 children and 1,000 women, have been killed in Israeli air strikes on the besieged Gaza Strip since the latest escalation began on October 7. Some 13,000 others have been injured.
Israel began its bombing campaign on the enclave after fighters from the Hamas armed resistance movement launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing an estimated 1,400 people.

Al Jazeera correspondent Hisham Zaqout gained access to the Rafah crossing last week. He said preparations are being made for the entry of aid into Gaza, but there are still several obstacles.
'Israeli raids have left large holes on the main road that will be used by conveys to deliver aid to the Gaza Strip, making it impossible for buses or aid trucks to use it, but Egyptian teams are currently paving over them so it will be functional again," said Zaqout. Israel has bombed the Rafah crossing  .
'We are also expecting teams from UNRWA to arrive to make sure the crossing is ready for the aid to go through," he continued, referring to the UN agency responsible for Palestinian refugees.
'Another problem is the delivery of the aid inside Gaza. The UN will conduct talks with the Egyptians, UNRWA officials and the Israeli side on this."
Some one million Palestinians inside the Strip have been displaced from their homes over the past two weeks, and many are suffering from the dire humanitarian situation there. On October 9, Israel announced a "total blockade" to cut off supplies to Gaza, and there is now a severe shortage of water, food, electricity and fuel.

Top Belgium officials, including PM, criticise Israeli bombing of Gaza

Brussels, Belgium - Belgian politicians and officials are increasingly questioning the scale and legality of Israel's offensive in Gaza, as more civilians are killed and a humanitarian disaster unfolds in the densely populated enclave.
On Monday, at a conference in Brussels, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, a liberal democrat, described Israel's campaign in Gaza as 'disproportionate'.
'If you bomb an entire   with the intention of eliminating a terrorist, I don't think it's proportionate,' he said, but insisted that 'Belgium will not take sides'.
On Wednesday, Belgium's deputy prime minister made a rare European call for  .
'It's time," Petra De Sutter, a Green party politician, told the Flemish newspaper Het Nieuwsblad. "The rain of bombs is inhumane.'
De Sutter  has also urged Hamas to release hostages and said money flows to 'this terrorist organisation' must be stopped immediately.
A day later, Caroline Gennez, Belgium's minister of development cooperation, suggested that the government was considering recognising the state of Palestine.
'This is necessary to achieve peace in the long term,' she told Al Jazeera.
And Fourat Ben Chikha, vice president of the Senate of Belgium – the federal parliament's upper house – told Al Jazeera on Friday that "You don't need to be a human rights professor or international lawyer to understand that international law is no longer being respected in this war."
He said progressive parties like the Greens, to which he belongs, have begun raising their voices in support of Palestine to build political pressure.
'There is no longer any rational reason for the death and violence we are seeing in Gaza. Even for the Israelis whose relatives have been taken as hostages, the bombing of Gaza isn't helping,' he said.
These statements appear in contrast with most leaders in Europe, where few have directly criticised Israel's bombing campaign that began on October 7, in response to Hamas's unprecedented attacks.
The general European view is that Israel has a right to self-defence, given the horrors of the Hamas incursion, as long as it stays within the boundaries of international law.
The Hamas assault killed more than 1,400 Israelis, and saw more than 240 kidnapped. Israel's attacks, officially aimed at wiping out the Palestinian group that rules Gaza, have killed more than 11,000 people in 34 days, including more than 4,500 children.
After De Sutter called for sanctions against Israel, German politician Reinhard Bütikofer wrote on X: "That is not the position of the European Greens."
"The German Greens in particular totally oppose such a move that would blame Israel for the crimes of Hamas who are using civilians as human shields."
But the shifting tone is being welcomed by some.
Abdalrahim al-Farra, Palestine's ambassador to the EU, Belgium and Luxembourg, said he has witnessed "a clear change in the position of the Belgian government".
"We sensed this from the principled and moral stance of Minister Caroline Gennez and Minister Petra De Sutter," he told Al Jazeera.
"Their calls came as a countermeasure to Israel's violation of international law and international humanitarian law, and the collective punishment on Palestinians."
Al-Farra's daughter is in Gaza, and some of his relatives were killed in the besieged strip due to Israeli attacks last week.
"I am convinced that Belgium's position will influence many of the positions of some member states,' he said.

Discussing the Israeli-Palestinian issue can be difficult in Belgium, because of the varying views between political parties in the Flanders in the north, Wallonia in the south, and the Brussels region.
Historically, Belgium has been known to show solidarity towards Palestine, while its official stance is also supportive of Israel. Like many in the West, Belgium has not called for a ceasefire in Gaza, despite efforts by left-wingers.
At the UN in 2012, the country voted in favour of giving Palestine "non-member" observer status. This year, it supported a UN resolution ordering the International Court of Justice to investigate Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.
In 2019, two local governments boycotted a trade mission to Israel.
Peter Mertens, general secretary of the Workers Party of Belgium (Partij van de Arbeid van Belgi), said the Belgian government "really has problems" speaking clearly on this matter "because they are being lobbied by Israel, and the lobbying from Washington is even bigger with institutions like NATO headquartered in Belgium."
He said the public and media have been pressuring the government to take a tougher stance against Israel "as the relentless bombardment of Gaza and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians continue".
'We've seen the positive announcements like a call for sanctions on Israel, more aid to Gaza and also five million euros ($5.33m) fund to support to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in investigating war crimes. But these calls are not coming from parties like the conservative Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie (N-VA), with some members having strong ties with Israel.
"Overall there has been no united stance from Belgium and even our party's resolution calling for a ceasefire, and for Belgium to recall its ambassador to Israel, was turned down,' Mertens added.
'Israel is losing this war on the ideological front'
Across Belgian cities, solidarity marches have erupted week after week, calling for peace in Palestine and the Israeli hostages to be released.
Late last month, Belgian transport workers' unions issued a statement refusing to load and unload military equipment destined for Israel, "while a genocide is under way in Palestine".
Prominent Belgian activist Anuna De Wever Van der Heyden said Israel's siege and bombardment of Gaza is fuelling a sense of anger and sorrow.
'Israel is losing this war on the ideological and political front. The discussion among [Belgian] government parties is a sign of that," she told Al Jazeera.
Belgian author Christophe Callewart said, "Israel has been delegitimised on a level never seen before. I don't see how they can ever come back from that."
Artists4Palestine Belgium, trade unions, and other pro-Palestine groups, such as BrusselsAgainstGenocide, are preparing for more Gaza solidarity protests on Saturday.

Israeli strikes in Gaza kill at least 13, destroy al-Shifa's cancer ward

November 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli air strikes in Gaza have killed more than a dozen people and destroyed the main hospital's cancer ward, Gaza officials say, as fighting continues in the besieged strip for the  .
At least 13 people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a home in Khan Younis, Gaza officials reported on Sunday.
The day before, at least 'several people' were killed and wounded in a strike at a UN compound in Gaza City where hundreds had sheltered, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) said.
'The ongoing tragedy of death and injury to civilians ensnared in this conflict is unacceptable and must stop,' the UNDP said in a statement.
Al-Shifa Hospital surrounded
The strikes continue as Israel steps up its offensive near Gaza's main hospital, al-Shifa, where health officials say thousands of medics, patients and displaced people are trapped with no electricity and dwindling supplies.
The hospital has repeatedly come under fire as Israeli forces   on the facility, which it accuses Hamas fighters of using as cover for a command centre – charges Hamas denies. Israel has not provided proof for its claims.
Witnesses inside al-Shifa Hospital told the AFP news agency that "violent fighting" had raged around the hospital all Saturday night.
One air strike destroyed the hospital's cardiac ward, Gaza officials said, while electricity cuts shut off incubators in the neonatal unit hosting around 40 babies and ventilators for others receiving urgent care.
Doctors Without Borders surgeon Mohammed Obeid said in an audio message posted on social media that two babies died in the al-Shifa neonatal unit after power to their incubators depleted and a man also died when his ventilator cut off.
The Israeli military pledged on Saturday to aid the evacuation of babies from the hospital, noting that "staff of the al-Shifa Hospital has requested that tomorrow".
Al-Shifa, one of the 16 operating hospitals left in Gaza, was also out of reach for the newly wounded, said Mohammad Qandil, a doctor at the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, who is in touch with colleagues there.
"Al-Shifa Hospital now isn't working, no one is allowed in, nobody is allowed out, and if you are wounded or injured around Gaza area you can't be evacuated by our ambulance to al-Shifa Hospital, so al-Shifa Hospital now is out of service", he told the Reuters news agency.
Israel has waged a devastating bombing campaign and ground incursion in the besieged Gaza Strip since October 7, killing at least 11,000 Palestinians, more than a third of them children, Gaza officials say. The UN's agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) says at least 100 of its employees have been killed in the war.
The Israeli campaign has also displaced some 1.6 million Palestinians, over 70 percent of the enclave's total population, and wrecked much of its infrastructure.
Palestinians forced from their homes now live in dire conditions, often sheltering in overcrowded outdoor camps and in desperate need of food, water and medicine. Humanitarian workers say what little aid has been allowed into the enclave is a 'drop in the bucket' compared to what is needed.
Hamas killed more than 1,200 Israelis and took some 240 hostages during its surprise attack on October 7, Israeli officials say.

'Can't sleep': Trapped British nationals try to flee Israel's Gaza bombing

November 4th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Ibrahim Assalia pays a visit to Gaza each year to see his parents.
But this year, the visit was urgent: His father was diagnosed with blood cancer.
So Assalia, his wife and their six children - all British nationals - left their home in North London to help their ailing family member receive treatment in Jordan.
But Israel's relentless bombing of the Gaza Strip following Hamas's attack on Israeli soil on October 7 made it impossible for Assalia's father to be able to leave the blockaded enclave.
He died last week as a result of receiving no medical care.
'He passed away on the 22nd of this month - during war,' Assalia told Al Jazeera, speaking by phone from the northern Gaza city of Jabalia.
When he went to the hospital to figure out how to bury his father, he was told to find any makeshift graveyard he could and put his body in, even if  .
  have been functioning as overflowing morgues, as Israel's near month-long bombardment has killed more than 9000 Palestinians.
'That's how they bury the dead here,' said Assalia. 'Like five, six, 10 in one grave.'
Assalia, a lecturer of media studies back in London, and a former English news presenter and editor for Palestine TV with the Palestinian Authority from 1998 to 2006, is trying to get his family out of Gaza.
They are among   and critically wounded Palestinians permitted to leave the strip since Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt opened on Wednesday for the first time since the war broke out.
Assalia received a phone call from the British Foreign Office late on Thursday, letting them know that their names were on a list of people approved to evacuate Gaza.

But Israeli shelling continues to deluge the route between the Rafah border and central Jabalia where he and his family fled to, after bombing intensified near their family home on the outskirts of the city.
'No taxi can take us there, simply because Israeli tanks are positioned in the area,' Assalia said.
'We heard that they shelled some civilian cars with passengers,' he added, explaining that he called six taxi companies on Friday morning who informed him of the shelling and told him it was too dangerous to make the hour-long journey along Gaza's main Salah al-Din highway.
On Friday, Israel acknowledged that it had   heading from Gaza City to the south, killing 15 people, according to Palestinian officials.
Trapped, the Assalia family shelters in one room with two other families who are also British nationals, all of them surviving on one meal a day of canned foods.
And their situation is only getting more desperate.
Assalia injured his finger after an Israeli air strike shattered a window near where he stood. His wife is running out of her epilepsy medication. And his 22-year-old daughter, a medical student, has been experiencing irritation on her skin she suspects could be due to Israel's alleged use of white phosphorus munitions.
Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of   in Gaza, which many experts say would be a  .
Grateful for visa
Back in the United Kingdom, Nasser Alshanti remains anxious about his daughter and her family, but is relieved to hear that they have managed to get out of Gaza.
Yosra Alshanti, her two young children and her husband Ibrahim Taha, crossed the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing, he said, and are now waiting to travel to Egypt's capital, Cairo, before they board a flight to the UK.
But communicating with Alshanti's daughter and her family, all British citizens except for Taha, has been difficult, said the Manchester-based university lecturer, due to communications blackouts on the strip.
It was Alshanti who managed to text his son-in-law Taha through WhatsApp about being on the list of people permitted to leave Gaza through the Rafah border, a message that lagged for a while before it finally got through.
While Yosra and her children will have no difficulty in entering the UK, Taha will need a special clearance as a non-British citizen to be able to - but it's something Alshanti persuaded British authorities to allow, he said.
'No way my daughter can leave Gaza without her husband,' is what Alshanti told British authorities, he told Al Jazeera. 'She has two children and is pregnant.'
The concerned father is unsure what type of visa Taha will receive, and has been told it could include everything from a spousal visa to one issued under humanitarian protection.
Alshanti has watched the events in the Strip unfold over the last weeks with trepidation, wondering if his daughter and her family, who have been living there for the last seven years, will be able to get out safely.
'I cannot explain my feelings. I couldn't sleep I couldn't focus during my lectures. All because my mind is totally engaged with what's happening in Gaza,' he said.
Alshanti said he is grateful for the British government's response in ensuring his family is safe, and for having added Taha to the evacuations list, despite hearing nothing from them for the first five days of the conflict.
'Each single day after five days, I received a call from the crisis team from London, asking me about my daughter,' he said, adding that a British border force team has flown from London to Cairo to give support to evacuating British nationals.

Dispatches from the Rafah border
Salma Alrayyes was checking Facebook every chance she could, during brief periods of gaining access to the internet, once she learned the Rafah border was opening.
That's where the Gaza border and crossings authority has been updating their list of foreign nationals permitted to leave each day.
Alrayyes saw her and her family's name Thursday at midnight. By 9am the next day, they made their way to Rafah, a 20-minute journey from where they were sheltering.
Hours later, Alrayyes, her husband, their three kids and her brother-in-law and his family - all British citizens - were still waiting to cross into Egypt after clearing through the Palestinian side of the border.
'We are going to Egypt now and then we'll see what we are going to do,' she told Al Jazeera by phone from the Rafah border crossing. 'But we had to leave [we] are afraid of the war.'
Alrayyes had been living in the Strip for the last two years. Her home in Gaza City was destroyed due to Israeli air strikes.
As she and her family flee, her husband's family who are not British nationals are left behind.
'We don't know what we are going to do,' Alrayyes said repeatedly with despair, cutting the phone call short as Egyptian border authorities summoned her and her family forward.

Turkey's Erdogan calls Israel a 'terror state', criticises the West

November 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called Israel a "terror state",   his condemnation of the Israeli assault on the besieged Gaza Strip ahead of a sensitive visit to Germany.
Erdogan said on Wednesday that Israel's military campaign against the Palestinian armed group Hamas included "the most treacherous attacks in human history" with "unlimited" support from the West.
He called for Israeli leaders to be tried for war crimes at the International Court of Justice in The Hague and repeated his view – and Turkey's position – that Hamas is not a "terrorist organisation" but a political party that won the last Palestinian legislative elections held in 2006.
"I say clearly that Israel is a terror state," Erdogan told members of his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in parliament.
"While we curse the Israeli administration, we do not forget those who openly support these massacres and those who go out of their way to legitimise them," he said, pointing to the United States and other Western allies of Israel.
"We are faced with a genocide," Erdogan added.
He called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to announce whether Israel has nuclear weapons and added that Netanyahu would soon be a "goner" from his post.
Ankara would take steps to ensure Israeli settlers in occupied Palestinian territories are recognised as "terrorists", he said.
Netanyahu, speaking at an event in Israel, said he will not be 'morally lectured' by the Turkish leader, saying Erdogan supports 'the terrorist state Hamas'.
The Turkish leader had taken a more nuanced line immediately after Hamas launched attacks on southern Israel on October 7. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and about 240 people taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.
But Erdogan's rhetoric has escalated as the scale of Israel's military response has grown.
Health officials in the Hamas-run territory said more than 11,300 people have been killed in Gaza, including more than 4,000 children.
Turkey this month recalled its ambassador to Israel and broke off official contacts with Netanyahu, suspending recent attempts by the two countries to repair their rocky relations.
Israel   it is "re-evaluating" relations with Ankara after calling back its diplomatic staff from Turkey and other countries in the region as a security precaution.
Erdogan made his comments two days before a planned meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has been forced to defend his decision to receive the Turkish leader.
Germany has  , and Scholz said he is opposed to an "immediate ceasefire" in Gaza.
'I don't think the calls for an immediate ceasefire or long pause – which would amount to the same thing – are right,' Scholz said on Sunday.
'That would mean ultimately that Israel leaves Hamas the possibility of recovering and obtaining new missiles,' he added, echoing the position of the US government and calling instead for 'humanitarian pauses'.

What were the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians?

September 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Thirty years ago, Israeli and Palestinian leaders met on the lawn of the White House in Washington to sign a deal many believed could be a precursor for peace in the region.
The first Oslo Accord brought together Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, the former was the Israeli Prime Minister, and the latter was the leader of the  .
A handshake was to follow between them – a significant gesture and the deal would lead them to both receive the Nobel Peace Prize, along with then-Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, the following year.
All three men are now dead, Rabin in circumstances directly related to the Accords. The peace process that the deal was supposed to begin has been stillborn, with Israel continuing its illegal occupation of Palestinian territory, and the Palestinian people no closer to – and some would argue further away from – an independent state.
Here's everything you need to know about the historic agreement and why it has seemingly failed:
What were the Oslo Accords?
The first Oslo Accord, known as Oslo I, was signed on September 13, 1993. The agreement between the Israeli and Palestinian leadership saw each side recognise the other for the first time. Both sides also pledged to end their decades-long conflict.
A second accord, known as Oslo II, was signed in September 1995 and went into more detail on the structure of the bodies that the peace process was supposed to form.
The Oslo Accords were supposed to bring about Palestinian self-determination, in the form of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. This would mean that Israel, which was formed on the land of historic Palestine in 1948 in an event Palestinians know as the Nakba, would accept Palestinian claims to national sovereignty. The claims, however, would only be limited to a fraction of historic Palestine, with the rest left to Israel's sovereignty.
To meet that goal several steps would need to be taken, including the phased withdrawal of the Israeli military from the Palestinian territories it had illegally occupied since 1967, and the transfer of authority to a Palestinian administration, except for final status issues, including the status of Jerusalem (the eastern half of which is occupied Palestinian land) and Israel's illegal settlements, which would be negotiated at a later date.
The accords therefore led to the creation of the supposedly temporary  , and the division of territory in the West Bank into Areas A, B and C, denoting how much control the PA has in each. which to this day administers limited rule over the two areas.
A final treaty was to be reached in five years – but that has not happened.

Who was opposed to the deal?
Right-wing Israelis had no desire to give the Palestinians any concessions, and did not want any agreements with the PLO, which they considered a "terrorist organisation". Israeli settlers also feared it would lead to their eviction from the illegal settlements in the occupied territories.
Elements of the far-right were so opposed to the Oslo Accords that Rabin himself was assassinated in 1995 for signing them. Among the people who had threatened Rabin before his death was Itamar Ben-Gvir, now Israel's National Security Minister.
Meanwhile, Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, warned that a two-state solution would forgo the right of Palestinian refugees to return to the historic lands seized from them in 1948 when Israel was created.
The late prominent Palestinian literary critic and activist Edward Said was among its most vocal critics, calling it 'an instrument of Palestinian surrender, a Palestinian Versailles'.

How did the accords break down?
The Oslo Accords witnessed a slow decline, with Israel continuing its occupation of Palestinian land and refusing to withdraw militarily from the majority of the West Bank while continuing to conduct raids into land considered under the full administration of the PA.
Following Rabin's death, a number of Israeli leaders who opposed the accords came to power, among them current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as Ariel Sharon.
A second intifada from 2000 to 2005 in turn led to heavy casualties, particularly on the Palestinian side, and made both sides less willing to agree to move the deal along.
Any attempt at restarting talks failed in the decade after, and the accords' interim clauses have become the status quo.
How are the accords viewed now?
Many Palestinians believe that Israel has used the Oslo Accords to justify its expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank.
In fact, as the Oslo Accords slowly broke down, Israel tripled its settlement building. Between 1993 and 2000, the Israeli population in the West Bank reached its fastest pace of growth ever, according to Dror Etkes, an Israeli peace campaigner.
Today, the Israeli government is dominated by far-right religious and ultranationalist politicians who have close ties to the settlement movement. In recent months, they have   of new homes in settlements in the occupied West Bank.
In fact, according to the left-wing Israeli movement Peace Now, Israel this year set a record for its settlement approvals, with at least 12,855 settler housing units approved since January.
Thirty years on, Palestinian statehood is unlikely in the short and even medium term, as final-status negotiations between Palestinian and Israeli leaders have continuously failed.
The West Bank lies fragmented, the blockaded Gaza Strip stands isolated in what many call an "  , and Israel has no plans to relinquish occupied East Jerusalem.
Many people, in both Israel and Palestine, believe the two-state solution is dead.

Israeli police arrest and brand Palestinian with 'Star of David': Report

August 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A Palestinian man who was detained by Israeli forces in occupied East Jerusalem said he has been physically abused after officers brutally beat him and branded the Star of David on his cheek, according to Israeli media reports.
The man's lawyer presented the charges to a Jerusalem district court on Thursday, a day after he was taken from his residence in the Shuafat refugee camp.
At least 16 officers were involved in the arrest of the Palestinian man, however, none had their body cameras on, according to the Ynet news website.
The officers blindfolded the man and proceeded to beat him with their fists 'in all parts of his body', Ynet reported. The man's cheek was then branded with the Jewish Star of David symbol, it added.
Wadim Shub, the Palestinian man's lawyer, was quoted as saying in a statement that the incident was 'a grave case of intentional violence and humiliation of a detainee by police' and demanded an immediate police investigation.
'As a law-abiding country, we must not put up with the phenomenon of police brutality. In this case, the nature of the injuries raises a strong suspicion that they were racially motivated,' Shub said.
The presiding judge, Amir Shaked, reportedly expressed his 'horror' over the incident, the Times of Israel reported, and directed the case to the police's internal investigations department.
The police department alleged that the man 'resisted arrest, violently attacking and kicking police who responded with 'reasonable force' to subdue him'.
The Palestinian man was detained for allegedly committing "drug trafficking offences", the reports said.
Al Jazeera reached out to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.
Israel is currently holding more than 5,000 Palestinian political prisoners, according to figures published by the rights group Addameer. At least 1,200 of them are held without charge or trial in a widely criticised practice known as administrative detention.
Israeli forces often conduct near-daily pre-dawn raids into the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in an attempt to crack down on a growing armed resistance.
Armed soldiers often prompt confrontations with Palestinian residents, arresting and even killing many of them.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed this year in the occupied Palestinian territories and the United Nations has warned that 2023 is on track to be the deadliest year for Palestinians since it started recording fatalities.
Palestinians and human rights groups have long accused Israeli forces of killing Palestinians under questionable circumstances. They say Israel does a poor job of prosecuting and punishing its forces in cases of wrongdoing.
Investigations often end with no charges or lenient sentences, and in many cases, witnesses are not even summoned for questioning.
Last month, an Israeli court   aborder police officerwho was charged with reckless manslaughter in the deadly shooting of Eyad al-Hallaq, an autistic Palestinian man.
The court ruled that the officer was acting in self-defencewhen he shot the 32-year-old in occupied East Jerusalem's Old City three years ago.

Prisoner exchange? Israeli captive families demand answers from Netanyahu

October 28th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The families of more than 220 captives seized by Hamas demanded answers from the Israeli government with many fearing a military onslaught on the Gaza Strip is putting the captives' lives at risk.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broke off from war planning for a hastily arranged meeting on Saturday with captive families after they threatened to start street protests to highlight their desperation.
As the meeting went ahead, Hamas said Israel would have to release all Palestinian prisoners from its jails to secure freedom for the hostages seized by Hamas fighters on October 7.
Netanyahu made no commitment to any deal but told the families, "We will exhaust every possibility to bring them home", according to a video released by his office. Finding the hostages – whose ages range from a few months to more than 80 – was an "integral part" of the military operation, he added.
At a later press conference alongside Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas had to be forced to the negotiating table but that it was "very complex".
"The more military pressure, the more firepower and the more we strike Hamas – the greater our chances are to bring it to a place where it will agree to a solution that will allow the return of your loved ones," he said.
'Every minute an eternity'
The government says it confirmed 229 captives from more than 20 countries were taken on October 7. The Hamas military wing says that "almost 50" hostages have died in the daily Israeli air raids on Gaza.
'We are ready to conduct an immediate prisoner exchange deal that includes the release of all Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in exchange for all prisoners held by the Palestinian resistance,' Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's leader in the Gaza Strip, said in a statement.
Thousands of Palestinians are held in 19 prisons in Israel and one inside the occupied West Bank.
A representative for the families told Netanyahu they support a full prisoner swap.
"As far as the families are concerned, a deal of a return of our family members immediately in the framework of 'all for all' is feasible, and there will be wide national support for this," said MeIrav Gonen, the representative. Her daughter, Romi, is one of the captives.
Israeli families are increasingly angry over the "absolute uncertainty" they face over the fate of the captives, particularly in the heavy bombings, said Haim Rubinstein, a spokesperson for the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
Hundreds of relatives of the Israeli captives held a rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday, threatening to hold street more protests if a government minister did not meet them the same day. Demonstrations in support of the captives' families also occurred in Haifa, Atlit, Caesarea, Be'er Sheva and Eilat.
"The families don't sleep, they want answers, they deserve answers," Rubinstein said.
Hostage families say they have had barely any contact with the government.
"We don't know anything about what happened to them. We don't know if they were shot, if they saw a doctor, if they have food," said Inbal Zach, 38, whose cousin Tal Shoham was kidnapped from the Beeri kibbutz near the Gaza fence with six other family members.
"We are just so worried about them."
'Waiting for an explanation'
The families are divided over what action to take.Some believe a tough line on Hamas is justified, others say a deal should be made.
When asked about the Hamas demands for a Palestinian prisoner release, Ifat Kalderon, whose cousin is a hostage, said: "Take them, we don't need them here. I want my family and all the hostages to come back home, they are citizens, they are not soldiers."
The Tel Aviv rally followed one of the most violent nights of the war with the military hammering Gaza.
"None of the war cabinet bothered to meet with the families to explain one thing: whether the ground operation endangers the wellbeing of the 229 hostages," the Forum said in a statement.
"The families are worried about the fate of their loved ones and are waiting for an explanation. Every minute feels like an eternity."
Sources told Al Jazeera on Friday that negotiations, mediated by Qatar, on a ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hamas had been 'progressing and at an advanced stage'.
But Israel's increased air and artillery attacks, severing of communications and ground incursion appear to have stymied the truce discussions.
Israel says Hamas killed 1,400 people, mainly civilians, when fighters stormed across the border on October 7.
More than 7,700 people have been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes on Gaza, including about 3,500 children, according to its health ministry.
