Analysis: Houthis declare war on Israel, but their real target is elsewhere

November 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
As Israeli attacks on Gaza continue unabated, with Hamas fighters getting just modest armed support from Lebanon-based Hezbollah, another, somewhat unexpected ally has stepped in to help the Palestinian armed group.
Just a few days ago I predicted that the successful interception by the United States Navy of all   towards Israel would discourage them from future waste of projectiles.
On Tuesday I was proved wrong when the Houthis again launched cruise missiles and drones at Israel. They never had much chance of hitting anything: More than 2,000km (1,240 miles) away, Israel is at the very limit of even the longest-ranged of Yemeni missiles.
And to reach Israel, Houthi missiles must first evade US Navy ships patrolling the region that can shoot them down, and then Israeli Navy missile corvettes stationed in the Red Sea.
The Houthis are surely aware of the limitations of their hardware and know that even if a few were to slip through, they could only inflict token damage at their Israeli targets.
So why bother?
The answer is simple: By firing cruise missiles they are not fighting a military but rather a political war. And the real target is not Israel but the Houthis' archenemy Saudi Arabia.
To understand this, it is necessary to look back at the history of Yemen and at rivalries in the Arabian Gulf region.
Yemen underwent a revolution in 1962 that ended centuries of rule by sheikhs of the Shia Zaidi sect. It changed the country profoundly. The predominantly Shia northern highlands proclaimed the pro-Western republic of North Yemen; their Sunni compatriots in the south aligned with the Eastern, Communist block as the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.
Fast forward through a couple of civil wars, unifications and further divisions, and by 1990, there was a main cleavage between the by-then-united Yemen and most of the Arab world. Yemen opposed the intervention of non-Arab states to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait after President Saddam Hussein invaded Iraq's smaller neighbour.
Saudi Arabia, which backed the US military intervention, retorted by expelling nearly a million Yemeni workers from the kingdom. For Yemen, already a poor nation, this meant additional economic hardship.
Meanwhile, a long-running contest for influence in the Middle East, between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has found a fresh theatre in Yemen, where a full-scale civil war erupted in 2014. Both powers meddled in the conflict: Riyadh openly, sending in a loose Arab-African coalition; Iran not sending its own troops but fully backing the Houthis. Nearly 100,000 children have died from starvation among the 400,000 who have lost their lives from fighting or famine in a war that has proven to be one of the bloodiest conflicts for civilians in the 21st century.
That conflict has somewhat abated as of last year, but Yemen still has two competing 'governments', neither in full control of the country.
One is the Iran-backed Government of National Salvation, based in the capital Sanaa, which controls most of the territory. The other 'government' notionally resides in the southern port of Aden, but its members spend their days in Riyadh, still claiming to be sole legitimate rulers.
Somewhat surprisingly, in March of this year Riyadh and Tehran responded to Chinese-Iraqi mediation efforts and re-established diplomatic relations after seven years. It is likely that both states wanted to defuse tensions in Yemen, but also to use the relaxation to pursue their other strategic interests. Saudi Arabia had a big plan to normalise relations with Israel.
Against this backdrop, the Hamas attack of October 7 on southern Israel was an unpleasant upset for Saudi Arabia. Within days, it reportedly told the US that it was   for the proposed deal with Israel that Washington was trying to mediate.
As Gaza was being attacked, the only armed support to the Palestinians, limited and timid as it may be, came from Iranian proxy Hezbollah. The Houthi missile launches of October 19 seemed a one-off. But the repeated, bigger salvoes earlier this week, albeit completely inefficient,potentially point to a pattern: another Iranian-backed group joining in the Palestinians' fight.
Meanwhile, the White House said  this week that 'the Saudi Arabians have indicated a willingness to continue' with work towards a normalisation deal with Israel. Saudi Arabia has not confirmed the White House claim.
Yet if there is any truth to the White House statement, the latest missile launches by the Houthis have just made it harder than ever to turn that plan into reality.

What's Israel's Hannibal Directive? A former IDF soldier tells all

November 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Yehuda Shaul describes his three years of service with the Israeli military, from 2001 to 2004, as the 'most violent period' of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict up to that point.
The   (2000-2005), or Palestinian uprising, was at its crescendo and then-18-year-old Shaul was an infantry combat soldier; later, he was promoted to commander. The Jerusalem born and bred paratrooper served in the occupied West Bank for two years, and for a third year was stationed at Israel's border with Lebanon.
Now 41, Shaul is a co-founder of the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence, the first such organisation of Israeli military veterans calling for an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
It was during his time stationedat the border with Lebanon that Shaul was first told about  , a former controversial Israeli military policy aimed at preventing the capture of Israeli soldiers by enemy forces – at any cost.
Israel last invoked it in 2014 during the war on Gaza that year, according to leaked military audio recordings, though the army denied it had used the doctrine. Dozens of Palestinians were killed in the Israeli bombardment that followed, sparking accusations of war crimes against the Israeli army.
But to Shaul, the Hannibal Directive made sense as a soldier of war.
So what exactly is it? And is the directive – which Israel is believed to have suspended in 2016 – relevant to Israel's   of Gaza that has killed more than 9,000 people? The bombing followed the October 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel in which more than 1,400 people were killed and at least 200 Israelis – including soldiers and civilians – were taken captive.
What is the Hannibal Directive?
The directive, also known as the Hannibal Procedure or Hannibal Protocol, is an Israeli military policy that stipulates the use of maximum force in the event of a soldier being kidnapped, said Shaul.
'You will open fire without constraints, in order to prevent the abduction,' he said, adding that the use of force is carried out even at the risk of killing a captive soldier.
In addition to firing at the abductors, soldiers can fire at junctions, roads, highways and other pathways opponents may take a kidnapped soldier through, Shaul said.
The Israeli military has denied the interpretation of the directive that allows for the killing of their fellow troops, but Israeli soldiers, including Shaul, have understood it as a licence to do just that, as it is preferred to a scenario in which a soldier is taken prisoner.
Shaul said that the directive was shared with him and other commanders orally. "I've never seen any written text of the rules of engagement," he said.
According to Annyssa Bellal, an international lawyer who specialises in armed conflicts and international law, and senior researcher at the Geneva Graduate Institute, the directive was never an official policy and was therefore never published in its entirety.
"From a legal point of view, the directive is very controversial," Bellal told Al Jazeera.
The aspect of the directive which risks killing a soldier is controversial under international law given that states must respect their citizens' right to life, which is not a right lost even if they are captured by other states, she explained.
Where does it get its name?
The origins of the directive's name are disputed, with some sources saying it is named after a Carthaginian general who chose to poison himself instead of falling captive to the Romans in 181 BC.
Israeli military officials, however, have said that a computer randomly generated the name.
Why was the directive created?
In 1986, Israeli army commanders drew up the doctrineafter three soldiers from the Givati Brigade, an Israeli infantry brigade, were captured by the armed Lebanese group  .
At that time, Israel occupied a southern region of the Levantine country in an area it created and called a security zone after its  . Hezbollah captured soldiers patrolling this zone, which would remain under Israeli occupation until 2000.
Members of the brigade saw a vehicle getting away with their captive fellow soldiers but did not open fire. The directive was created in response to ensure that never happened again.
The remains of the captured soldiers were returned to Israel 10 years later in 1996, in exchange for Israel returning the bodies of 123 Hezbollah fighters, according to the Israeli government.
Israel's hardline stance since then is due to the fact that a soldier's abduction is a strategic move for an enemy, Shaul said, giving them negotiating power, as well as the ability to affect both national morale and public support for a conflict.

Why not swap prisoners?
In 2006 Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was seized by Hamas. After five years in captivity, he was eventually released in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, the highest number of prisoners Israel released for one of its soldiers.
The release of Palestinian prisoners themselves was "seen as a humiliation and damaging the national honour" which put Israel in a state of national psychosis, said Uri Misgav, an Israeli journalist at Haaretz, in a   on the Hannibal Directive.
'That's why we want to prevent [the capture of soldiers] at all costs, even at the cost of the death of the soldier,' said Shaul.
Following Shalit's return, Israel began to arbitrarily arrest more Palestinians, including minors, in order to expand its assets for any future exchanges, wrote Eyal Weizman, a British Israeli architect and director of the research agency Forensic Architecture at Goldsmiths, University of London, in the November 2023 issue of the London Review of Books.
"All of this reinforces the perception that the life of one of the colonisers is worth a thousand times more than the lives of the colonised," Weizman wrote.
When was the last time it was invoked?
On August 1, 2014, during Israel's 50-day bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which the Israeli military called Operation Protective Edge , the besieged enclave's southern area of Rafah bordering Egypt was pounded after Hamas fighters captured Israeli officer Lieutenant Hadar Goldin.
Israeli artillery and tanks pounded four neighbourhoods for several hours - at times firing a shell a minute - while fighter jets simultaneously carried out air strikes.
The deadly firepower killed at least 135 civilians, with Amnesty International deeming the day "Black Friday" and accusing Israel of having committed war crimes.
'In the eyes of the Israeli public and from the eyes of Palestinians in Gaza', Israelis had lost the operation with the capture of Goldin, Shaul said.
Exacting brute might, therefore, was a way for Israel to gain an upper hand, he added.
The Israeli military would later conclude that Goldin succumbed to his wounds in fighting with Hamas, however, his body was never recovered.
But even back in Israel, the episode caused disquiet - including among the ranks of the army.
"An army that wants to save a captive doesn't act like this. An army that wants to ensure the death of both captive and captors acts like this," one soldier wrote to then army general Benny Gantz at that time, according to Misgav. Gantz is now a member of Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war cabinet.

When was the directive revoked?
The directive is believed to have been revoked in 2016.
It is unclear what led to its annulment but a report by Israel's state comptroller had recommended that the army abolish the directive because of the criticism Israel received for its use in Rafah, as well as because of its various interpretations by those in the army, Haaretz reported at the time.
Is the directive still relevant to Israel's current assault on Gaza?
On October 7, Hamas  , many of whom are still in captivity or have been killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza, Hamas has said. But many of those captured are civilians and not soldiers, to whom the directive does not apply.
Additionally, the sheer number of captives this time around makes the directive redundant, according to Shaul.
"Let's say Hamas has one soldier and let's say the agreement says to free a thousand [Palestinian] prisoners. There are 5,000 prisoners in prison. Now, let's say Hamas has six and they decide to free 3,000," said Shaul.
"But now Hamas has 200!" he continued.
So is Israel truly finished with the Hannibal Directive?
Bellal said that, in some way, the directive has already been put into practice in the war on Gaza.
Israel has largely refused to negotiate with Hamas to release its captives, instead choosing to employ the use of force against the Gaza Strip which somewhat "mirrors what the directive was about", she said.
Israel's current assault on Gaza already supersedes its previous most deadly ones in 2008 and 2014. In 2008, 1,385 Palestinians were killed over 22 days, while in 2014, Israel killed 2,251 Palestinians, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
Weizman's observations are similar to Bellal's.
"With the current indiscriminate bombing of Gaza, the government seems not only to be bringing unprecedented destruction on the people of Gaza but to be returning to the principle of preferring dead captives to a deal," he wrote.
Why was the directive shrouded in secrecy?
For nearly two decades, military censorship kept the policy under wraps.
In 2003, however, an Israeli doctor, Avner Shiftan, learned of the procedure while serving as a reservist in Lebanon, and contacted the Israeli newspaper Haaretz to air his views. Shiftan pushed for its end and the directive therefore came to public light - but it did not cause much of a reaction from the Israeli public.
Shaul said that while the directive has been controversial in the international arena outside of the military, when he first heard about it as a soldier, the policy made clear sense.
'I think people saw it as insensitive because the order was to kill soldiers,' he said.
'But as soldiers, it makes perfect sense. You don't want to be abducted and maybe just missing for the rest of your life. Or who knows what [else could] happen with you?'
Do other militaries have similar directives?
Since many militaries operate in confidentiality, under classified operations in order to not give too much information to enemies away, it is difficult to know what other militaries do, said Bellal.
Many states' official lines, however, are that they don't negotiate with abductors and, particularly, groups they deem 'terrorists', she added.

Israeli settlers storm Al-Aqsa Mosque complex on fifth day of Sukkot

October 4th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Dozens of Israeli settlers have forced their way into the flashpoint Al-Aqsa Mosque complex in occupied East Jerusalem to mark the fifth day of Sukkot, according to the Islamic Waqf Department.
Since Sunday, thousands of settlers have been carrying out provocative tours of the mosque complex following calls by ultranationalist Jewish groups.
According to Jewish law, entering any part of the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, also known as the Temple Mount, is   due to the sacred nature of the site.
Sukkot is a weeklong holiday, which started on September 29 and will continue until Friday.
Israeli settlers stormed the complex on Wednesday in groups through the al-Mughrabi Gate by the Western Wall near Al-Aqsa Mosque and attempted to perform "Talmudic rituals", according to a Waqf official.
Police imposed age restrictions and prevented young Palestinians from entering the mosque during the incursions, witnesses told the Anadolu news agency.
The Israeli army forced Palestinians to shut down their stores in the Old City to allow Jewish prayers to take place. The Palestinian Wafa news agency reported that Israeli forces prevented a number of Waqf employees from entering the holy Islamic site in the morning.

Spitting arrests
Meanwhile, Israeli police on Wednesday arrested five people suspected of spitting towards Christians or churches in the Old City of Jerusalem and formed a special investigative team to deal with growing complaints of hostile gestures against Christians.
"Unfortunately, we witness the continued disgraceful acts of hatred towards Christians in the Old City of Jerusalem, primarily through spitting by extremists," said Jerusalem District Commander Doron Turgeman on Wednesday.
No details were provided on the identities of the people arrested.
Members of the area's small Christian community have said they have faced growing harassment and intimidation from Jewish ultranationalists, particularly since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-right government took office late last year.
Wednesday's arrests came as the city prepared for its annual Jerusalem March, an event that usually draws huge crowds, including thousands of Christian pilgrims.
The spitting scene, captured on Monday by a reporter at Israel's left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, shows a group of foreign pilgrims beginning their procession through the limestone labyrinth of the Old City in occupied East Jerusalem, home to the holiest ground in Judaism, the third-holiest shrine in Islam and major Christian sites.
Raising a giant wooden cross, the men and women retraced the Old City route that they believe Jesus Christ took before his crucifixion. Along the way, ultra-Orthodox Jews in dark suits and broad-brimmed black hats squeezed past the pilgrims through narrow alleyways, their ritual palm fronds for the weeklong Jewish holiday of Sukkot in hand.
As they streamed by, at least seven ultra-Orthodox Jews spat on the ground beside the Christian tour group.
The incident, which the city's minority Christian community lamented as the latest in an alarming surge of religiously motivated attacks, drew rare outrage from Netanyahu and other senior officials on Tuesday.
Al Jazeera's Rob Reynolds, reporting from the Old City in occupied East Jerusalem, said the incident "came on the heels of an incident earlier this year, a couple of weeks ago where more video tapes showed people spitting at some Orthodox Greek nuns outside a place of worship, a church.
"The government of Israel including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials quickly condemned the spitting incidents, saying they had no place in Israel. However, other figures in the ultranationalist Israeli movement said that actually spitting at Christians is a legitimate Jewish tradition with a long history," Reynolds said.
Since Israel's most conservative government in history came to power late last year, concerns have mounted among religious leaders – including the influential Vatican-appointed Latin Patriarch – over the increasing harassment of the region's 2,000-year-old Christian community.
Roughly 15,000 Christians live in Jerusalem today.

What is the humanitarian situation in Gaza?

Trapped in a  , the besieged residents of Gaza are expected face unimaginable suffering over the coming days.
In retaliation for Hamas's lightning attacks on Israeli towns over the weekend, Israel has continued its pounding of the territory, with more than 200 air raids on commercial zones, residential areas and refugee camps.
As of Tuesday, more than 700 Gaza Palestinians have been killed, including about 100 children. The Ministry of Health in Gaza reported nearly 4,000 people were injured.
Aid groups say that damage to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities already disrupted services to more than 400,000 people. Now Israel is squeezing Palestinians in Gaza further, extending an existing 16-year air, land and sea blockade of the territory, home to some 2.3 million people.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has announced 'a complete siege' on Gaza, referring to Palestinians as 'a beastly people'.

Having sealed off the territory, Israel appears set to trigger a major escalation of the conflict, with indications that it is gearing up for a ground invasion.
Israeli forces and tanks have been deployed along the border of the densely populated sliver of land, and an unprecedented 300,000 reservists have been activated.
While Israel is being supported in its retaliatory drive by the United States, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, rights groups have expressed concern about its attempts to collectively punish the entire population of Gaza.
'Deliberate killings of civilians, hostage-taking, and collective punishment are heinous crimes that have no justification,' said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement, making reference to both the actions of Hamas and the Israeli government. 'The unlawful attacks and systematic repression that have mired the region for decades will continue, so long as human rights and accountability are disregarded.'
Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council aid group, warned that Israel's siege would spell 'utter disaster' for Palestinians in Gaza.
'There is no doubt that collective punishment is in violation of international law,' he told The Associated Press news agency. 'If and when it would lead to wounded children dying in hospitals because of lack of energy, electricity and supplies, it could amount to war crimes.'
Legal experts have been raising the question of whether Israel's actions could be considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court, which announced it had jurisdiction over the occupied territory in 2021.
I agree, the language is genocidal and the conduct clearly implicates 6(c) of the ICC Statute.

Shelter – 'No safe place'
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said early on Tuesday that Israeli raids razed 790 housing units and severely damaged 5,330.
According to the UN, more than 187,000 of Gaza's 2.3 million people have left their homes – the most since a 2014 air and ground offensive by Israel uprooted about 400,000.
There are no bomb shelters in Gaza. Residents who have lost their homes have nowhere to turn except the 83 UNRWA schools across the territory. On Monday, the UN reported 137,000 Palestinians were taking shelter in these schools.
According to UNRWA, which provides services to refugees, four schools have sustained damage in Israeli attacks. On Monday, UNRWA spokesperson Abu Hasna said: 'There is no safe place in Gaza.'
This is not the first time that schools sheltering civilians have been hit by Israeli bombs. In 2014, the Jabalia Elementary Girls' School, housing 3,300 displaced Palestinian civilians, was struck, causing the deaths of 15 civilians - UNRWA had repeatedly communicated the school's coordinates to Israeli officials to ensure its protection.
Food and water – supplies running out
UNRWA expects a 'severe shortage' of drinking water in Gaza due to the cuts announced by Israeli authorities.
Efforts to organise food deliveries through Rafah - where cargo capacities are lower than other crossings into Israel - are apparently under way, according to an Egyptian official who spoke to the AP.
The World Food Programme has been delivering bread and tinned food to people sheltering in UNRWA schools.
According to one father of four young children living between the Deir el-Balah and Khan Younis refugee camps, the local market is still selling food, but basics like flour and sugar are running out fast. 'Market traders are unable to reach farmers with remaining stocks of fruit and vegetables from local farmers because the roads are now too dangerous,' he told Al Jazeera.
Medical – hospitals under attack
A spokesperson with Gaza's Health Ministry said on Monday that Israeli strikes have targeted hospitals and medical crews. Six healthcare workers have been killed and four others injured. Eight healthcare facilities have sustained damage from strikes and nine ambulances have been damaged.
'Hospitals are overcrowded with injured people, there is a shortage of drugs and [medical supplies], and a shortage of fuel for generators,' said Ayman al-Djaroucha, Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) deputy coordinator in Gaza.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health has called for a 'safe corridor to ensure the entry of urgent medical aid' into  .
The Red Crescent has delivered some medical aid to Gaza through the Rafah crossing.
Electricity – two days left
It is thought that the Gaza power plant – now the only source of electricity – could run out of fuel within days. The loss of electricity will directly affect hospitals and the water supply.
'Gaza has had only four hours of electricity in the past two days,' said Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed, reporting from Gaza. 'The sole power plant here is saying it can only operate for a maximum of two more days and after that. The entire Gaza Strip won't have even one hour of electricity unless fuel enters Gaza. It's not only civilians that are suffering the loss of electricity,' she added.
A total blackout will directly affect hospitals.
Communication – losing touch with the world
Israel has hit the headquarters of the private Palestinian Telecommunications Company, affecting landline telephone, internet and mobile phone services, making it increasingly difficult for the population to maintain contact with friends and families in the outside world.

Child casualties in Gaza a 'stain on our conscience': UNICEF

The United Nations Children's Agency (UNICEF) has decried the "staggering" number of children casualties in Gaza, where officials say Israeli bombardment has killed more than 2,000 minors.
Reporting that 2,360 children have been killed in less than three weeks, UNICEF called for an immediate ceasefire and sustained and unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance.
A further 5,364 children in Gaza have been injured in the 'unrelenting attacks,' UNICEF added on Tuesday. More than 400 children are reportedly either killed or injured daily in the besieged Palestinian enclave, it said.
On October 7, Palestinian group Hamas launched surprise attacks on Israel, which killed more than 1,400 people. Israel's army has since relentlessly bombed Gaza, killing at least 5,791 people. Children make up roughly 50 percent of Gaza's population of about 2.3 million.
'The situation in the Gaza Strip is a growing stain on our collective conscience. The rate of death and injuries of children simply staggering,' said Adele Khodr, UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and North Africa.
'Even more frightening is the fact that unless tensions are eased, and unless humanitarian aid is allowed, including food, water, medical supplies and fuel, the daily death toll will continue to rise.'
Almost every child in the Gaza Strip has been exposed to deeply distressing events and trauma, marked by widespread destruction, relentless attacks, displacement, and severe shortages of daily necessities such as food, water, and medicine, UNICEF said.
The West Bank has also seen an 'alarming surge in casualties', the agency said. Twenty-eight children have been killed and at least 160 have reportedly sustained injuries.
UNICEF said 30 children were reported to have been killed in the recent violence in Israel, while dozens are still in captivity within Gaza after Hamas took about 220 people captive.
"The killing and maiming of children, abduction of children, attacks on hospitals and schools, and the denial of humanitarian access constitute grave violations of children's rights," said Khodr.
"UNICEF urgently appeals on all parties to agree to a ceasefire, allow humanitarian access and release all hostages. Even wars have rules. Civilians must be protected, children particularly, and all efforts must be made to spare them in all circumstances.'
UN chief Antonio Guterres also renewed calls for a   on Tuesday and said international law was being violated in the war between Israel and Hamas.
He said Palestinians 'have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation', but Palestinian grievances do not justify Hamas's attack.
At the same time, 'those appalling attacks [by Hamas] cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people', he continued.
'The tip of the iceberg'
With the constant trauma of war and occupation, four out of five children in Gaza live with depression, grief and fear, according to a2022 report  by Save the Children.   of them struggle with suicidal thoughts and the  of witnessing the deaths of other children.
Last week, a Palestinian NGO said one child in Gaza is killed every 15 minutes in Israel's ongoing bombardment. 'We are witnessing a genocide in real time,' a spokesperson for the Defense for Children International - Palestine (DCIP)  .
Amid the war, education has been put on hold and schools are being used to shelter displaced people. Schools, like hospitals, have also suffered damage from the ongoing aerial attacks.
Israel blockaded the Gaza Strip after the Hamas attack, preventing food, fuel and regular aid from getting through. In the last week, a few dozen trucks carrying aid have been allowed in through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, but NGOs say the supplies are not near enough.
The dire and pressing lack of water also poses grave consequences for children, UNICEF said on Tuesday, noting that most water systems have been severely affected or are nonoperational due to fuel shortages and damage to vital infrastructure.
UNICEF said fuel, which Israel has not allowed into Gaza, is of paramount importance for the operation of essential facilities such as hospitals, desalination plants, and water pumping stations. It also said neonatal intensive care units, some housing newborns in incubators, rely on mechanical ventilation, making an uninterrupted power supply a matter of life and death.
'Without humanitarian access, the deaths from attacks could be the tip of the iceberg," said Khodr. "The death toll will increase exponentially if incubators start to fail, if hospitals go dark, if children continue to drink unsafe water and have no access to medicine when they get sick.'

'Boycott Israel' breathes new life into 100-year-old Egyptian soda brand

November 19th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Cairo, Egypt – Spiro Spathis, Egypt's oldest carbonated drinks company, is having a sensational comeback.
Founded in 1920 by a Greek beekeeper from Kefalonia whose name it bears, "Spathis" has been part of life for generations of Egyptians.
Now, thanks to a nationwide campaign to boycott Western producers supportive of Israel, the century-old brand is causing a stir as the poster child for Egyptian solidarity with Palestinians.
Spiro Spathis, which has always been proud of its role as Egypt's first soft drink brand, is rolling out slogans like '100% Made in Egypt' and 'Egypt's original gazouza', using an Egyptian term thought to derive from the French "gazeuse" (carbonated) and widely used to refer to fizzy drinks.
A surge in demand for Spathis
'I've been selling their drinks for four years. There were always a few consumers who preferred Spiro over other drinks, but not many," Mohammed, who owns a grocery store in Sharqia governorate, said.
"But now, their bottles run out almost instantly. Before the boycott, I would sell four, maybe five, boxes of Spathis in a week, now I can sell as many as 50 boxes in a day if I have that many in stock,' he continued, adding that the surge in demand is "massive".
'Demand has tripled over the past month,' Morcus Talaat, the company's head of marketing and one of three siblings who own the firm, told Al Jazeera.
Talaat spoke to Al Jazeera between back-to-back meetings at the no-frills, two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment in an upscale Cairo neighbourhood where Sprio Spathis has its headquarters. 'We've received hundreds of calls from new clients… offers from restaurants.'

Spiro Spathis has gone on a recruitment drive and received more than 15,000 applicants for jobs it advertised to try to meet the demand.
In Cairo's neighbourhood of Nasr City, a kiosk owner says he has not been able to source enough Spathis to meet the demand. 'I've only had four deliveries in the past month, and it gets sold out on the same day. Previously, Spathis' stocks lasted longer.'
A popular tool for protest
Israel's relentless bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, which began on October 7 and has so far killed more than 11,500 Palestinians, has prompted mass protests around the world.
It has also caused many to   and Starbucks.
In Indonesia, consumers began boycotting Mcdonald's and other businesses in mid-October after McDonald's Israel announced on social media that it had handed out thousands of free meals to the Israeli military during its war on Gaza.
The announcement prompted several organisations, including the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS), the United People Front (FUB) and the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), to call for a boycott of McDonald's and other businesses perceived to be pro-Israel, including Burger King.
As protesters flood the streets of major cities around the globe, from Washington, DC, to London and Cape Town, branches of franchise restaurants, coffee shops and stores that were once bustling in the Arab World are largely empty.
'Boycotting is a form of popular tool for people to make themselves heard, and is the most powerful means to pressure Western colonialism and capitalism-fuelled states,' said Jamal Zahran, political science professor at the University of Suez. 'Boycotting these products also creates opportunities for local products.'

'Is that a fly?'
Since the start of the war, Egyptians have been using social media to exchange information about which brands are considered supportive of Israel and should be avoided. Some apps are also listing alternatives to Western brands, highlighting local producers of equal or similar quality.
'Is it with us, or not?' is a question frequently asked on Meta posts about various brands, as people research which to give up.
The result has been the rediscovery of local substitutes like Spiro Spathis, which was once the only soda drinks manufacturer in the Arab world's most populous country.
But, as other international brands entered the market about 70 years ago, then flooded the local market, it was sidelined. Spiro Spathis even shut its doors altogether in 2014, Talaat said. 'We're the second generation of Egyptians to own the firm. Our father bought the company in 1998 and ran it up until he passed away in 2009. In 2014, we closed down Spiro Spathis, before returning again in 2019, and have been present in the market every single day since,' he added.
Although it is not the only local soda drinks company in Egypt, Spathis is being lauded by many online users in Egypt as the best.

Trending on social media, the company's history and logo have gained attention and stirred the curiosity of younger generations not familiar with the brand.
'Why is there a fly in its logo?' some asked on social media.
According to Talaat, the century-old logo is, in fact, a bee, not a fly, marking the founder's original profession as a beekeeper on the Greek island of Kefalonia.
Social media users also joked about the difficulty of finding a Spathis soda because of the increased demand and limited supply. 'I'm trying to find myself, and Spiro Spathis,' quipped one Meta user.
'We're working around the clock to meet the surge in demand,' said Talaat. 'Since October 7, we've been executing a year's plans of expansions, growth and distribution in a period of a month to meet the market's needs.'
Besides expanding geographically, increasing production of its eight flavours and hiring teams to address consumer feedback and manage distributors' orders, Talaat also said the company is planning to add a new cola flavour that customers asked for to replace the colas being boycotted in Egypt.
'This isn't temporary'
Since the war, Egyptian social media users have noted offers and discounts for Western-made products they have turned their backs on.
Many have also engaged in online debates about the efficiency of such boycotts which some see as harming the livelihoods of Egyptian workers employed by franchises.
Sahar Azazi, 31, who lives in Cairo, said boycotting brands is the most obvious action to take.
'It's the least we can do to support Palestinians under attack, and it is not a temporary action on my part. I won't be eating or drinking something that has made the murder of an innocent Palestinian possible,' she said, adding that Spiro Spathis as a local product is just as good as the drinks she's given up.
'They're not as available, though, since the boycott began,' she noted.
For Talaat, Spiro Spathis is very much back in business.
'We plan to be there for Egyptian consumers always, even if the boycott doesn't last. We're here to stay,' he said.

UN agencies hope truce will allow aid into northern Gaza

United Nations agencies have welcomed the entry of aid trucks into the Gaza Strip from Egypt after a   got under way between Israel and Hamas but said more needs to be done to deal with the massive humanitarian crisis in the enclave after seven weeks of war.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was working on more evacuations from hospitals, which have been repeatedly attacked by Israeli forces.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the entry of aid into Gaza was a "step in the right direction" but "much more is needed".
"We continue to call for a sustainable ceasefire to end further civilian suffering," he posted on X.
We welcome the start of the humanitarian pause in #Gaza  and the movement of humanitarian aid, including for health.
It's a step in the right direction, but much more is needed.
We continue to call for sustained ceasefire to end further civilian suffering.

Aid agencies have said they are aiming to deliver supplies to northern Gaza, where hospitals have   because of   and the lack of fuel and where there are major concerns about dehydration and disease outbreaks.
Aid deliveries are so far only being allowed through Gaza's one border crossing with Egypt in the southern part of the enclave and not through its crossings with Israel.
"The United Nations can confirm that, as I speak, trucks with humanitarian supplies continue to cross into Gaza through the Rafah crossing point," said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
Asked whether the UN had guarantees from Israel that it could deliver aid to the north, Laerke said: "We proceed on the basis of the hope and the expectation that we will reach people in need where they are."
Before the conflict started in October, nearly 10,000 truckloads of commercial and humanitarian commodities, excluding fuel, entered Gaza monthly, according to the UN.
On Friday, OCHA said in a statement that 80 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies entered from Egypt the previous day.
Gaza resident Ashraf Shann told Al Jazeera that people were happy that "some sort of aid is coming" into the enclave.
"My family is made up of 12 people, and we are internally displaced persons. This is the first time this has happened to us," he said.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said it received two ambulances and 85 aid trucks loaded with humanitarian aid, including food, water, medical supplies and medicines.
While about 200 aid trucks are expected to enter Gaza during the four-day humanitarian pause, PRCS spokesperson Nebal Farsakh told Al Jazeera that it was a 'drop in the ocean'.
'The situation has gone beyond catastrophic at a humanitarian level and a medical level. The complete health sector now is collapsing during this ongoing escalation,' Farsakh said.
Today, the Palestine Red Crescent teams received two ambulances and 85 trucks loaded with aid from the Egyptian Red Crescent through the Rafah crossing.

Hospital evacuations under way
WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said the agency was working on further hospital evacuations as soon as possible. "We're extremely concerned about the safety of the estimated 100 patients and health workers remaining at al-Shifa", referring to the largest medical complex in Gaza, which was a major focus of Israel's ground offensive.
Lindmeier declined to react to comments from Gaza's Ministry of Health that it was suspending cooperation with the global health agency amid reports that Israel was holding medical staff for questioning.
Tommaso Della Longa, spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told the Reuters news agency that its local partner had a convoy of ambulances heading north to evacuate patients from al-Ahli Arab Hospital.
"We do hope that this pause in the fighting will give us the possibility of reaching all the people in Gaza, including areas in the north where it was impossible to have access," he said.

Gaza exports to resume after Israel agrees to reopen vital crossing

Israel will reopen the   to Gaza after Israeli authorities closed it earlier this week, saying they had found explosives headed out of the blockaded territory.
Karem Abu Salem (called Kerem Shalom by Israel) is the only crossing Israel allows to be used for commercial shipments.
After an investigation and "necessary adjustments," the crossing was safe to reopen, Israel said, without elaborating further on the explosives found.
"A short while ago, the Israeli side informed us of the decision by the Israeli government to resume exports from Gaza Strip through Karem Abu Salem crossing starting Sunday, the same way it used to be before the closure," said a statement by the Palestinian Authority's committee that liaises on the movement of goods in and out of Gaza.

The move was condemned by Palestinian industrial and economic unions, which warned of potential economic and social consequences.
Earlier, The General Federation of Palestinian Industries in Gaza denounced the Israeli decision at a news conference, branding it 'collective punishment' that worsened the hardship endured by two million people in Gaza living under an Israeli blockade since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007.
Nearly all the goods that enter and exit Gaza pass through Karem Abu Salem.
Challenges faced by   during the closure were particularly acute. Their surplus stock perished before it could reach markets in Israel.
Gaza's main fishermen's union reported $300,000 in losses due to the closure, a significant blow. Fish accounted for 6 percent of all Gazan exports in July.
'Living conditions will improve'
The reopening promised a reprieve for fishermen like Khalid al-Laham, a 35-year-old father of five who lives in the southern city of Khan Younis. Al-Laham was forced to borrow food from shops to feed his family during the closure.
"The financial and living conditions will certainly improve," al-Laham said.
"I will be able to feed my family and live a decent life."
While the reopening promises to relieve producers across the territory, Gaza's economy remains hamstrung by Israel's blockade – which has been in place since June 2007, when Israel imposed an airtight land, sea and air blockade on the area.
Israel controls Gaza's airspace and territorial waters, as well as two of the three border crossing points; the third is controlled by Egypt.

Hezbollah leader Syed Hassan Nasrallah addressed his followers on Friday, making his first comments on   since it broke out on October 7.
  has escalated along their fraught border in recent weeks. The Lebanese armed group claims to have lost 47 fighters while Israel says that six of its soldiers have been killed in their exchange of fire and missiles. At least six civilians have also been killed.
Many expected Nasrallah to announce the group's next moves, but he refrained from doing so, instead condemning the Israeli attacks Gaza.
Here are the key highlights from his address:
The October attack was an exclusively Palestinian operation
Nasrallah   by praising 'the fallen martyrs' of Hezbollah and the other groups fighting Israel, as well as the civilians killed.
He then also thanked the "strong and brave Iraqi and Yemeni hands who are now involved in this holy war,' in an apparent reference to armed groups in the two countries — including the   — who are allies of Hezbollah and have launched attacks against Israel or the United States in recent days.
He described the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, in which more than 1,400 people were killed, as "a big event to shake this oppressive … occupying, usurping Zionist regime and its supporters in Washington and London".

He said the "operation was 100 percent Palestinian in terms of both decision and execution."
"That element of secrecy was the linchpin to this emphatic success of the operation, it came as a surprise, shocking surprise, unlike what's assumed by many."
Independent of Iran
"This operation has no bearing on any decision or move to be taken by any other faction within the resistance axis," Nasrallah said, referring to the Iran-led coalition of anti-Israel forces in the region.
"At any point of time when there is a battle, they start to speak about the Iranian nuclear programme, the US-Iran negotiations," Nasrallah said.

In reality, he claimed, "the secrecy surrounding the entire operation" on October 7 proved that the attack was solely about the Palestinian cause, and unrelated "to any international or regional issue".
"Since the Iranian revolution … [Iran has] always been openly adopting and supporting resistance factions in Lebanon, Palestine and in the region. However, they do not exercise any form of authority or control over these factions or in their leadership. And what happened … proves this fact."

US responsible for the war in Gaza
Nasrallah also blamed the US for the continuing violence in Gaza.
"Gaza and the Gazans have been reeling under the brunt of barbaric, ferocious, brutal, ruthless, merciless aerial bombardments," he said.
He accused the US of remaining "silent" in the face of "the images   torn apart in Gaza as a result of the Israeli missiles".
Nasrallah said the US response exposed the West's "hypocrisy" on issues like democracy and the rule of law.
"We're living in a jungle. We all must establish this fact. The United States is totally responsible for the war raging in Gaza, against unarmed defenceless people," he said.
Hezbollah already in the battle since October 8th
Nasrallah said that Hezbollah entered "the war" the day after the Hamas attack happened.
"Some claim that we are about to engage in the war. I am telling you, we have been engaged in this battle since October 8," Nasrallah said.
"The Islamic resistance in Lebanon started operation the very next day."
"What's taking place on our front is very important and significant," said Nasrallah, claiming that the conflict on the border with Israel was the hottest it had been since 1948.
"Yet I assure you this will not be the end. This will not be sufficient."
Asks for more from Arab nations
Nasrallah also made a call to other Arab countries to help Gaza.
"We are calling on the Arab and Muslim states to cut off oil and gas and food supplies from Israel," Nasrallah said, echoing a demand made by Iran earlier this week.
He said that he hoped that "at a point of time, the whole humanity will listen to the sound of reason".

Which of Gaza's hospitals is Israel threatening?

November 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel's warplanes and tanks are circling around the Gaza Strip's hospitals as health facilities increasingly come under attack.
The assaults on hospital compounds affect not just thousands of patients but also an estimated 122,000 displaced Palestinians  sheltering in those facilities during unrelenting bombing by Israel.
On Friday, the threat to many of Gaza's hospitals mounted further.
Here is how hospitals are being targeted:
Which hospitals have tanks surrounded?
Gaza's Ministry of Health says Israeli tanks on Friday   four hospitals from all directions. These are the al-Rantisi Hospital, al-Nasr Hospital, and the eye and mental health hospitals.
About 1,000 people are seeking shelter at al-Rantisi, the only hospital in Gaza that specialises in treating children with cancer. Israel has recently struck vehicles outside al-Rantisi, which is located in northern Gaza.

'Israel is turning its back to the international community and maintains its crimes against hospitals, health centres and shelter centres across the Gaza Strip,' Palestinian Health Minister Mai al-Kaila said in a statement cited by the Wafa news agency.
What about al-Shifa Hospital?
The compound of al-Shifa Hospital, the Gaza Strip's largest medical facility, was hit by an  , and it wasn't a one-off strike.
Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said on Friday that Israel has bombed al-Shifa Hospital buildings five times since Thursday night.
The hospital has been a repeated Israeli target over the past month. World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson Margaret Harris warned that the hospital is 'coming under bombardment'.
'You can hear a lot of gunshots, and then you know that the tanks are getting near to al-Shifa Hospital,' Dr Ahmed Mokhallalati, an al-Shifa surgeon, told Al Jazeera.
Medical student Ezudine Lulu took to Instagram and warned  in a video early Friday afternoon: 'It is possible that the entire hospital will be bombed within hours."
  is the most extensive hospital complex in the Gaza Strip. While al-Shifa has the capacity for 700 patients, it is currently treating about 5,000, according to Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF).
Israel alleged that Hamas is using al-Shifa for military purposes. Hamas has rejected these claims, saying al-Shifa shelters more than   displaced people in Gaza.
Over the past week, al-Shifa has been attacked multiple times with Israeli missiles hitting   and the facility's solar panels as an Israeli siege causes fuel shortages.
How are hospital functions impacted?
Several hospital departments have been targeted by Israel, compromising hospital functions and damaging buildings and equipment.
According to al-Qudra, Israel shelled the maternity department and outpatient clinics at al-Shifa this week.
Gaza is under a total blockade by Israel. Al-Shifa has been denied urgently needed supplies of medicines and fuel. Fuel shortages threaten the function of generators, which run vital equipment like ventilators and dialysis machines.
An unprecedented influx of wounded patients coupled with medical supplies that are rapidly running out leaves surgeons with no choice but to operate on patients on floors and without anaesthetics or pain relief.
"It is painful for the medical team. It is not simple. It is either the patient suffers pain or loses his life," said Mohammad Abu Salmiya, director general of al-Shifa Hospital.
Both al-Rantisi and al-Shifa are located in northern Gaza. UN humanitarian office spokesperson Jens Laerke said the aid entering Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt cannot enter northern Gaza. He urged Israel to reopen the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known in Hebrew as theKerem Shalom crossing, which sits at the junction of Gaza's border with Egypt and Israel, to allow more aid through.
What has happened so far?
Eighteen of Gaza's 35 hospitals with inpatient facilities have stopped functioning either due to damage from shelling and air strikes or from the lack of fuel, Gaza's Health Ministry said.
Israeli strikes have targeted Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis and Al-Quds Hospital along with two centres of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Jabalia and Gaza City, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported. Gaza's Health Ministry was also targeted.
On October 18, nearly 500 people were killed in an air attack on   in the besieged Gaza Strip.
The Gaza Health Ministry said the blast was caused by an Israeli air raid. Israel attributed the explosion to a misfired rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad armed group.
What does international law say about attacking hospitals?
International humanitarian law based on the 1949 Geneva Conventions considers hospitals   that receive protection.
However, the 1977 Additional Protocols to the conventions outline some exceptions to this. Article 13 states that medical units shall lose their special protection if 'used to commit, outside their humanitarian function, acts harmful to the enemy'. In such cases, it says, warnings and 'a reasonable time limit' should be given before an attack.

EU's foreign policy chief Borrell backs pause in Israel-Hamas war

European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has backed calls for a pause in the   describing the   entering the Gaza Strip as "not enough'.
Borrell said on Monday that the 'most important thing' was to get more humanitarian aid to the besieged enclave, home to more than two million people.
'Personally, I think a humanitarian pause is needed in order to allow the humanitarian support to come in and be distributed, seeing that half of the population of Gaza has been moving from their houses,' he told reporters before a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg.
Borrell said Hamas also must stop its rocket attacks on Israel and release the more than 200 people Israeli officials say have been taken captive as 'part of any step towards de-escalation".
His comments came as the bloc debates calls for a pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas amid warnings of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Israel has been bombarding the enclave after imposing a  , pledging to eliminate Hamas for the armed group's October 7 attacks inside the country, which Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
Israeli air raids have killed more than 4,740 [or 4,651 as in the live blog?] Palestinians, mainly children and women, in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities.
United Nations officials have warned that the 2.3 million residents of Gaza are on the brink of starvation and at risk of cholera and other serious diseases due to the collapse of water and sanitation services.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last week called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the release of captives held by Hamas.
The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that would have called for a pause in fighting to allow   into the enclave while also condemning Hamas's attacks inside Israel.
While trucks carrying aid began entering Gaza on Saturday after a US-mediated deal between Israel and Egypt, UN officials have warned that the volume is only a small fraction of the aid usually delivered to the Strip.
On Sunday, Turkey's Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said a plane had taken off for Egypt, carrying a medical team and supplies for Gaza.
The EU has struggled to present a unified stance on the conflict, with confusing and sometimes contradictory messaging by officials raising tensions within the bloc.
Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, faced criticism for speaking on behalf of the bloc as a whole earlier this month after travelling to Israel to offer Europe's backing in its war on Hamas.
Borrell has condemned Israel's blockade of Gaza, describing it as a violation ofinternational law.
On Friday, US President Joe Biden hosted European leaders, including von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, at the White House for a summit intended to deliver a message of unity on conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.
In a statement released after the summit, the two sides condemned Hamas for its "brutal terrorist attacks across Israel" while expressing concern about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Hamas releases video showing three women hostages in Gaza

October 30th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Palestinian armed group Hamas has released a video that shows three hostages held in the besieged Gaza Strip, drawing condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The video was released on Monday by the armed wing of Hamas, the Qassam Brigades.
The women who appear in the video are likely to have done so under duress.
Denouncing the video as "cruel psychological propaganda", Netanyahu identified the three as Yelena Trupanob, Danielle Aloni and Rimon Kirsht.
In the video clip, three women are sitting side by side against a bare wall. They have no visible signs of injury. One of the women delivers an angry message to the Israeli prime minister, accusing Netanyahu of failing to protect Israeli citizens when Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7.
At least 1,400 people were killed in the attack, according to Israeli officials, and more than 230 others were taken as hostages.
The women in the video called for an agreement to secure their release in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
"You were supposed to free all of us. You committed to free us all. But instead, we are carrying your political, security, military, diplomatic failure," she said.
Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher said some families of those held captive had reacted "quite positively" to the release of the video.
"It runs just over a minute," Fisher said. "The background is deliberately nondescript so that no place can be identified. The woman who addresses Netanyahu in particular with the quotes says that she blames him for the security, intelligence and military failure on October 7.
"Some families have reacted quite positively to the release of the video. They understand how it came about, but they say that anything that essentially gives proof of life is to be welcomed and gives them encouragement."
In a statement, Netanyahu repeated a pledge to make every effort to bring the hostages home.
"Abducted by Hamas, which is committing war crimes, I embrace you. Our hearts are with you and with the other captives. We are doing everything to bring home all the captives and the missing," he said.
The women's families were due to give a news conference at 7pm (17:00 GMT).
The short video is the second hostage message to be issued by Hamas, following an earlier clip of 21-year-old Franco-Israeli woman Mia Schem that was released on October 17.
The presence of the hostages in Gaza has complicated the ground operation in the enclave begun by Israeli forces last week, following an intense campaign of air strikes that Palestinian authorities say has killed more than 8,000 people.
  so far, but efforts to secure additional releases through back-channel efforts coordinated by Qatar appear to have been put on hold following the start of the ground operation.

Displaced cook uses donations to feed 50 Palestinian families

Khan Younis – Among the dozens of tents set up for displaced Palestinian families by the United Nations-run training college in this city in southern Gaza,   full of bubbling white beans in red sauce are cooked over an open fire.
One of the cooks ladles a serving to the huddle of mostly children, who are holding out metal bowls and pots in their outstretched hands.
'More food please,' one boy says.
Other children clamour around the cook, pushing their bowls and pots in front of them.
'Uncle, I've been waiting for a while,' says another.
'Uncle, put me some more, even if it's just soup,' yet another one pipes up.
A man's voice is heard over the noise, instructing the cook.
'Make sure you give two servings to the old woman standing," he says. "There are 15 people in her family."

According to the cook, Abu Ibrahim Zaqout, this new initiative, which was just set up on Wednesday, has already managed to feed 50 families, or about 500 people.
"The man behind the idea is Abu al-Abed al-Masri from Beit Hanoon, who was displaced with his entire family of more than 50 people," Zaqout says.
"He approached me with the idea of   after seeing that they needed food here," he explains. "I told him I know how to cook well, and I have experience in volunteer work."
People donated food and cooking utensils and the team, assembled of volunteers from Zaqout's family, cooked lentils on the first day.

The Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip, which began on October 7 after a surprise Hamas attack that killed 1,405 Israelis, has been the most brutal for the last 15 years.
For three weeks, Israeli warplanes have bombed the Gaza Strip from the north to the south, and imposed a total blockade, cutting off electricity, fuel and destroying the communications tower.
According to the health ministry, more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed, including 2,913 children and 1,709 women. A further 1,950 people are missing under the rubble of their homes, including 940 children.
Entire neighbourhoods have been levelled to the ground, and the indiscriminate bombing has led to the internal displacement of 1.4 million Palestinians of a population of 2.3 million, the United Nations said.
The Israeli military has dropped leaflets and called Palestinians on their mobile phones, warning them to flee their homes in northern Gaza and Gaza City and head south.
Zaqout and his family, 10 members altogether, were forced to leave their home in Beit Hanoon in northern Gaza and make their way south to Khan Younis.
"We will cook whatever food or ingredients people donate to us," Zaqout said. "There is no bread, and we don't want the children to sleep hungry."

Gaza death toll tops 5,000, nearly half of them children: Officials

October 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Nearly 5,100 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel launched a relentless bombing campaign against the besieged enclave after an attack by Hamas inside Israel more than two weeks ago, according to health officials.
About 40 percent of the 5,087 people killed are children, Gaza's Ministry of Health said on Monday, the day when Israel's army said it carried out more than 300 new air attacks within 24 hours. Palestinian officials said more than 400 people were killed in that period.
Thousands of buildings have been destroyed, and more than one million people displaced in the territory, which has been under siege and largely deprived of water, food and other basic supplies.
Fighting raged unabated overnight after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised that Israel would "erase Hamas", an armed group that runs Gaza, as a full-scale ground invasion loomed.
Hamas's attack in southern Israel killed at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials.
 
On Monday, the Israeli military said it had hit "over 320 military targets in the Gaza Strip" in the previous 24 hours.
It said the targets "included tunnels containing Hamas terrorists, dozens of operational command centres" as well as "military compounds and observation posts" used by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another armed group.
Gaza's government media office said more than 60 people were killed in the raids during the night, including 17 in a single strike that hit a house in northern Gaza, and at least 10 were killed in new strikes on Monday morning.
In the south, Rafah resident Mohammed Abu Sabalah said he had returned home from a mosque after dawn prayers on Monday and "a quarter of an hour later there was a bombing".
"We couldn't see anything because of the thick smoke," he said, adding, "We thank God that we've emerged safe and sound" with "only a few windows and doors destroyed".
Israel has continued bombarding Gaza's south despite telling 1.1 million people in the north of the besieged enclave to relocate there ahead of an expected ground offensive.
'We were displaced from Tal al-Hawa to Rafah at the request of the Israeli army, and this is what happened to us. My son is a 3-month-old martyr,' the father of a child killed in an attack in Rafah told Al Jazeera.
Israeli forces are massed near the Gaza border, and smaller units have already carried out limited incursions, targeting Hamas and hoping to rescue captives the group took from Israel on October 7. Israel now puts the number of captives at 222.
In one such operation, a 19-year-old Israeli soldier was killed and three wounded, the army said, adding that the tank operation aimed "to dismantle terror infrastructure … and locate missing persons and bodies".
Hamas confirmed the skirmishes, saying its fighters encountered an Israeli armoured unit infiltrating east of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The group said its fighters destroyed some Israeli military equipment.

Gaza's two largest hospitals have stopped taking new patients due to Israeli bombardment and shortages of medicine and fuel amid reports of rising deaths among patients and medical staff.
Al-Shifa and  , Gaza's biggest and second-biggest hospitals, respectively, said on Sunday that they had suspended operations as the World Health Organisation called for an immediate ceasefire to prevent rising deaths.
Dr Nidal Abu Hadrous, a neurosurgeon working at Al-Shifa Hospital, said patients and staff were facing a 'disastrous' situation with no electricity or water and no safe passage out.
"This can't last long. Urgent intervention to save the staff and the patients is required,' Abu Hadrous told Al Jazeera.
Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza also suspended operations after its main generator ran out of fuel, hospital director Ahmed al-Kahlout told Al Jazeera.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the situation at Al-Shifa Hospital was "dire and perilous".
"The world cannot stand silent while hospitals, which should be safe havens, are transformed into scenes of death, devastation, and despair," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X, adding that Al-Shifa was "not functioning as a hospital anymore."

Three nurses have been killed at Al-Shifa Hospital since Friday amid Israeli bombardment and clashes near the complex, the UN relief agency in the occupied Palestinian territory said in its latest update on Sunday.
Twelve patients, including two premature babies, have also died since the start of power outages, while critical infrastructure, including the cardiovascular facility and maternity ward, has been badly damaged, according to the UN agency.
Gaza's health ministry has said that three premature newborns have died.
The WHO has said that 600-650 patients, 200-500 health workers and about 1,500 internally displaced people remain at the hospital with no safe passage out.
The patients include 36 babies who are at risk of dying due to the lack of functional incubators, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-governed enclave.
Israeli forces have surrounded medical facilities in the north of Gaza, including Al-Shifa Hospital, which Israeli officials claim is located on top of a Hamas command centre.
Hamas and hospital officials have denied that the complex hides any military infrastructure.
Palestinian officials and people inside the hospital have reported Israeli forces directly targeting the hospital complex with munitions and snipers.
Health Ministry Undersecretary Munir al-Boursh said snipers were firing at any movement inside the compound.
"There are wounded in the house and we can't reach them," he told Al Jazeera. "We can't stick our heads out of the window."
Israel's military said on Sunday it offered to evacuate newborn babies and had placed 300 litres (80 gallons) of fuel at the entrance of the hospital, releasing video of its soldiers carrying containers and putting them on the ground, but that Hamas had blocked its efforts.
Hamas denied that it refused the fuel and said the hospital was under the authority of Gaza's health ministry.
Al-Shifa Hospital director Muhammad Abu Salmiya rejected the Israeli statement as "propaganda".
"Israel wants to show the world that it is not killing babies. It wants to whitewash its image with 300 litres of fuel, which barely lasts 30 minutes," Abu Salmiya told Al Jazeera.
More than half of the 35 hospitals in Gaza are no longer operational amid Israel's bombardment and ground operations in the enclave, which were launched in response to Hamas's October 7 attacks on southern Israeli communities.
Israel's campaign to eliminate Hamas has killed at least 11,078 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry.
Health officials have not updated the death toll since Friday, citing the collapse of services and communications at hospitals in the enclave.

Guardian cartoonist's contract not renewed after Netanyahu drawing

The British news outlet The Guardian says it will not renew cartoonist Steve Bell's contract after he submitted a cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Bell said the cartoon, which shows Netanyahu preparing to operate on his own stomach with an outline of Gaza, was rejected by the outlet for evoking the anti-Semitic 'pound of flesh' trope, a reference to the character Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.
The character of Shylock, one of the best-known examples of literary anti-Semitism, has been used for centuries to promote a racist depiction of Jews as greedy and obsessed with money.
Bell said in a post on X that he submitted the cartoon last week and "received an ominous phone call from the desk with the strangely cryptic message 'pound of flesh'".
When Bell said he did not understand the message, he said he "received this even more mysterious reply 'Jewish bloke; pound of flesh; antisemitic trope.'"
Bell told the BBC that the accusations "made no sense to me, as there is no reference to that play [Merchant of Venice] in my cartoon, which shows Netanyahu, poised to perform a surgical operation on himself while wearing boxing gloves, the catastrophic consequences of which are yet to be seen.'
He said it was inspired by an old cartoon of US President Lyndon Johnson during the Vietnam War.
A spokesperson for The Guardian told The Telegraph that it would not renew Bell's contract.
The row comes as   between pro-Palestinian groups and Israeli supporters around the world amid Israel's war against Hamas, the Palestinian group which governs the besieged Gaza Strip. Israel has bombarded the coastal enclave relentlessly for 10 days, killing more than 2,000 people, after Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing more than 1,400 people.
Authorities in some countries have been accused of cracking down on civil liberties in the name of defusing communal tensions, with France banning   and government officials in the United Kingdom asking whether waving a Palestinian flag could be a criminal offence.
On Tuesday, a surgeon working at a hospital in Gaza said in a social media post that his family in the UK had been visited and 'harassed' by British counterterrorism forces after he had spoken with the BBC about deteriorating   in Gaza, where Israel has cut off access to food, water and electricity for the strip's 2.3 million residents.
In the United States, a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy named Wadea Al-Fayoume was   and his mother was seriously wounded on on Sunday. Police said they had arrested a suspect, who had singled out the victims because of their Muslim faith and as a response to the Israel-Hamas war.
In the United Kingdom, police in London have reported a "massive increase" in anti-Semitic incidents.
Between September 30 and October 13, there were 105 anti-Semitic incidents and 75 anti-Semitic offences in the city, compared with 14 incidents and 12 offences in the same period last year, according to police figures.
"In balance, we have seen an increase in Islamophobic incidents, but nothing like the scale of the increase in antisemitism," Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor told a press briefing on Friday.
Community leaders have urged calm, underscoring the necessity of abstaining from attacks on Jewish or Muslim people in response to events overseas.

Are Israel's attacks on Gaza's hospitals legal?

November 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Fears are mounting that Gaza's hospitals, many already on the brink of collapse, may come under intensified attack as the Israeli military moves deeper into the enclave.
In recent days, Israeli warplanes have been circling closer to two hospitals in Gaza City –   and   – bombing areas in their immediate vicinity. Both hospitals have received orders by the Israeli military to evacuate, a demand that doctors and independent experts say is impossible to fulfil, given the large numbers of patients in their wards, including patients on life support.
The looming threat comes as hospitals across the besieged enclave, deprived of essential fuel and medicine, are collapsing. Sixteen out of 35 are no longer functioning. Hospitals that are still running warn that once generators shut down, they will be unable to keep ventilators,   and dialysis machines working and will effectively turn into morgues.
What is happening to Gaza's hospitals? To what extent are they protected by international law?
Which hospitals are under threat in Gaza?
In recent days, al-Quds and al-Shifa hospitals in Gaza City and the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza have seen attacks in their immediate vicinity. They are just three of 13 hospitals across the strip that have been repeatedly ordered to evacuate despite treating thousands of patients.

Speaking after the attacks near al-Quds, Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, told Al Jazeera: "Evacuating them means killing them."
The World Health Organization said striking the hospital, which is treating hundreds of patients and houses 14,000 displaced Palestinians, would be illegal.
Al-Shifa, which means "house of healing" in Arabic, is the largest hospital in the strip, currently treating thousands of patients. The Israeli military has alleged Hamas has built several military complexes under it. Hamas has   the allegation.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said "there is nowhere safe for these patients to go". Any evacuation would, it said, "be a death sentence". Hospitals are also sheltering about 117,000 displaced people whose houses have been bombed.
Last week, Israeli bombs damaged part of the cancer ward at the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital. On Wednesday, the hospital   it had been forced to close. "We tell the world: 'Don't leave cancer patients to a certain death due to the hospital being out of service,'" hospital director Subhi Sukeyk said.
Has Israel said it will attack hospitals?
"What we see is they are preparing the public for [the] bombing of hospitals," Neve Gordon, professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London, told Al Jazeera on Thursday.
On Monday, in what appeared to be a preemptive deflection of anticipated criticism, the Israeli military released a video alleging that al-Shifa was a Hamas command and control centre, acting as "one of the headquarters" of the group's military wing, the  . Last week, Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari presented a 3D map of alleged Hamas centres and tunnels beneath the hospital.
The latest onslaught on Gaza's hospitals follows last month's explosion at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, which has yet to be independently investigated. Palestinian authorities said the blast killed nearly 500 people, and they pointed the finger at Israel.
Israel blamed Palestinian Islamic Jihad, but its evidence, including footage of a missile filmed 40 minutes after  the blast and a verifiably doctored recording  of a purported conversation between Hamas operatives that linguists found to be syntactically unusual, has cast doubt on its claims.
Al-Ahli had also received multiple warnings to evacuate before the blast.
To what extent are hospitals protected by international law?
International humanitarian law is based on the 1949 Geneva Conventions, signed after the horrors of the Second World War. Under the conventions, hospitals are considered 'civilian objects' and receive de facto protection, said Srinivas Burra, associate professor in international humanitarian law at South Asian University in New Delhi.
The 1977 Additional Protocols to the conventions set out specific provisions for hospitals. Article 12 clearly states: 'Medical units shall be respected and protected at all times and shall not be the object of attack.'
However, Article 13 then goes on to outline exceptions, stating that medical units shall cease to be protected if 'used to commit, outside their humanitarian function, acts harmful to the enemy'. In such cases, it says, warnings and 'a reasonable time limit' should be given.
"The law avows the protection and then disavows it," Gordon said. He said hospitals could lose their entitlement to protection in cases in which they are used to shield fighters or store arms or if they are located close to legitimate military targets.
There are also questions of proportionality, whether the military aim justifies the harm caused.
As Gordon put it, "the higher the value of the military target, the more people you're allowed to kill." Hamas's headquarters would, in his view, be considered a high-value target.
"You can inflate a military target and you can deflate the damage you create," he said.
"The protection of hospitals is not absolute. It can be compromised if it is being used for military purposes," Burra said.
However, he pointed out that it is it not sufficient for an enemy to warn an entire hospital treating the sick and wounded to evacuate.
Warnings would have to be issued directly to combatants, allowing sufficient time to comply and proving they were still present before attacking.
"In the current situation, it looks like no such warning has been given," he said.

Israel accuses Spain of siding with Hamas after 'genocide' accusation

Madrid, Spain – Israel and Spain are embroiled in a diplomatic row after some Spanish ministers were accused by Israel of siding with Hamas in the Middle East  , a claim rejected by Madrid.
The dispute arose after left-wing Spanish politicians of the coalition government accused Israel of engaging in the '  ' of the Palestinian people.
Ione Belarra, the social rights minister who is also the leader of the Unidos Podemos, the far-left junior partner in Spain's coalition government, has posted several times on social media in support of Palestine while criticising the Israeli occupation.
On Monday, she called on Spain to bring Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the International Criminal Court for war crimes.
Spain's equality minister, Irene Montero, echoed this appeal, saying the same call was made "a few weeks ago in the case of the [Spanish] aid worker murdered in the war in Ukraine".
Montero has also posted on social media, declaring: "Violations of international criminal law and war crimes cannot go unpunished. Defending peace and human rights is today the most urgent task of all."
We ask our partner that, as the Government of Spain, we bring Netanyahu before the International Criminal Court for war crimes. Here is my official statement  pic.twitter.com/Wuu8nnKfVp

The Israeli Embassy in Madrid said in a statement issued on Monday that some Spanish ministers, who were not named, were siding with the  , which more than a week ago launched a deadly offensive in Israel that took the world by surprise and set off a major new war.
The embassy said that it was 'deeply worrying' that 'certain elements within the Spanish government have opted to align themselves with this terrorism of ISIS type'.
Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, have repeatedly said that "Hamas is ISIS" since the group's October 7 attacks. The Israeli army also claimed an ISIS flag was found at the site of an assault.
Since Hamas's incursion, during which the group is accused of killing hundreds of civilians and capturing several others, Israel has blockaded and bombarded the Gaza Strip, the besieged enclave ruled by the Palestinian group.
Hamas has denied intentionally killing civilians, but acknowledged "collateral damage" was possible. It has also admitted to taking several Israelis hostage.
Overall, more than 4,000 people – including Israelis, Palestinians and some foreigners – have been  .

The dimplomatic dispute is certain to strain Israeli-Spanish diplomatic relations and show how the Israel-Hamas war was spilling over into European relations, analysts said.
Spain and Israel only established diplomatic relations in 1986 after decades of no contact during the rule of General Francisco Franco, which ended in his death in 1975.
Israel demanded that Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez condemn the 'absolutely unmoral' remarks made by his government's ministers, saying that they endangered the safety of Jewish communities in Spain.
Spain's Foreign Ministry hit back late on Monday, issuing a statement that criticised the embassy statements as 'falsehoods'.
It said the Spanish government condemned the Hamas attacks on Israel and called for the protection of civilians in Gaza.
'Any political leader can freely express their positions as a representative of a political party in a full democracy such as Spain's,' it added.
Spain recently backed a recent   between Morocco and Israel, ending years of antipathy between Rabat and Jerusalem.
Belarra, the social rights minister, denied the claims made by the Israeli Embassy in Madrid.
'Denouncing this genocide is not 'aligning with Hamas'," she said. "It is a democratic obligation. Silence, complicity with terror,' she said in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.
Earlier on Saturday, wearing a tracksuit with the red, green, white, and black of the Palestinian flag, the Podemos parliamentary spokesman Pablo Fernandez appeared before a televised press conference on Monday.
Meanwhile, Montero, a senior figure in Podemos, has claimed in a social media post that Netanyahu "asked in 2019 (in the Israeli parliament) to finance Hamas. Violations of international law and war crimes will never count on our complicity or our silence. We defend democracy and life".
After July's inconclusive elections, Spain's acting government is led by the Socialists and supported by two junior far-left parties Unidos Podemos (Unite Together) and Sumar (Add Up) as well as regional groups.
As the Socialists try to form a new government by garnering the support of smaller parties, Sumar, which is led by Deputy Prime Minister Yoland Diaz, called for Spain to recognise Palestine as an independent state.
The political divisions over the Israel-Hamas war forced Prime Minister Sanchez to break off from a European Union conference in Albania on Monday to clarify Spain's position, which was at loggerheads with that of his far-left allies.
'I would like to reiterate our condemnation of the Hamas attack against Israel. Israel has the legitimate right to defend itself within international law and humanitarian law,' he told journalists. 'At the same time, the protection of civilians is essential, as is access to international aid for those in need, especially in the Gaza Strip.
"The only way to resolve the conflict is the recognition of the two states, so that they can co-exist in peace and security.'
The row prompted opposition right-wing parties to accuse Sanchez and his political allies of tarnishing Spain's image abroad.
Alberto Nunez Feijoo, the leader of the opposition conservative People's Party, told reporters in Madrid on Tuesday that Spain's response to a complaint by Israel was 'rude'.
"Israel is a country in shock. It is not the moment to have a conflict with Israel and unfortunately, we have it,' he said.
Santiago Abascal, leader of the far-right Vox party, the third biggest party in the Spanish parliament, said members of the Spanish government included 'admirers of Hamas's terrorism'.
Lluis Orriols, an expert in Spanish politics at the University Carlos III of Madrid, said the political splits within the Spanish left were to be expected, especially when a caretaker government had less discipline over what its members say than if it was in office.
'The points of view of members of Podemos on Palestine and Israel are not unknown, but the important thing is that in this acting government, the ones which dictate foreign policy are the Socialists,' he told Al Jazeera. 'If the left forms another government, Podemos will play a less important role and Sumar will be more prominent."
Jos Ignacio Torreblanca, Madrid director of the think-tank European Council of Foreign Affairs, said EU institutions had failed to adequately respond to the Israel-Hamas war.
'It is not so much about parties having different views, which we have known for long, but about the EU institutions malfunctioning, especially unilateral actions in contradiction with the EU High Representative Josep Borrell,' he told Al Jazeera.
'We're used to member states' differences, but the EU states should help find consensus, not reproduce and aggravate differences.'
About 50,000 Jewish people live in Spain, according to government statistics.
Two demonstrations in favour of the Palestinians took place in Madrid and Barcelona at the weekend.
Away from the world of politics, Spaniards like Gema Otero, a businesswoman based in Barcelona, said civilians are suffering the most because of the Israel-Hamas war.
"I don't care much for who is right and who is wrong," she told Al Jazeera. "There are people on both sides who are dying and suffering over a row which could be solved if they stopped fighting.'

Israeli families bring genocide complaint against Hamas to ICC

The families of nine Israeli victims of last month's Hamas attacks have lodged a complaint at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for genocide, according to their lawyer.
The families also want Hamas, the group that governs Gaza, prosecuted for suspected war crimes, and for the ICC to issue an international arrest warrant for its leaders, lawyer Francois Zimeray said in a statement on Friday.
On October 7, Hamas carried out raids that Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people.
"The complaint concerns victims who were all civilians," Zimeray said, adding that several of them were at the Tribe of Nova music festival.
"The complaint states that the Hamas terrorists do not deny the crimes committed, which they have amply documented and broadcast, and that the … facts cannot therefore be disputed," he said.
In an interview with France's Radio Classique, Zimeray said he was always wary of "excessive qualifications" of events.
But, he said, he and his legal team had established that the "genocide" accusation "holds up before the law".
Any individual or group can bring a case to the ICC, which is located in The Hague, but it is up to the court's prosecutor to launch an investigation.
Contacted by the AFP news agency, the court was not immediately able to say whether it had received the paperwork on the case.
The ICC, founded in 2002, investigates and prosecutes grave offences across the world.
In 2021, it opened a probe into Israel as well as Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups for possible war crimes in the Palestinian territories.
Its prosecutor, Karim Khan, has said that any suspected war crimes in the ongoing conflict would fall under the ICC's jurisdiction.
ICC teams have not, however, been able to enter Gaza, or Israel which is not a member of the ICC.

What do we know about the Israel-Hamas truce extension?

Qatar and Hamas   that the truce between Israel and the Palestinian group will be extended for an additional two days, a much-needed respite from the incessant Israeli bombardment. Here is what we know about the truce extension:
How did the initial truce unfold?
A four-day Israel-Hamas truce mediated by Qatar was expected to end on Monday morning.
Besides a four-day pause in fighting, both sides agreed to release prisoners and captives. Hamas was to release 50 women and children held captive in Gaza while Israel agreed to release 150 women and children from Israeli prisons. Hamas took 240 captives after its deadly attack inside Israel on October 7 while about 10,000 Palestinians languish in Israeli prisons, most of them without any charges.
Additionally, the deal would allow an increase in the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been under a total lockdown since early October.
Since the truce came into effect on Friday, Israel has released 150 prisoners in three batches.
Hamas has released 69 women and children since then, including 51 Israelis and 18 foreign nationals.
The deal allowed for the extension by one day for each extra batch of 10 captives Hamas releases.
What have Qatar, Hamas and Israel said about the extension?
Hours before the initial truce was set to expire on Monday, Qatar and Hamas said that the agreement would be extended for two days.
'The State of Qatar announces that, as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip,' Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Majed al-Ansari said on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday.

- د. ماجد محمد الأنصاري Dr. Majed Al Ansari (@majedalansari) November 27, 2023
'We have now agreed to release more hostages and extend the agreement for two days. This is good news for our people, especially the people of Gaza,' Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told Al Jazeera. 'I hope we can extend it until we reach the end of this war. We want to end the war.'
"We hope the occupation (Israel) abides (by the agreement) in the next two days because we are seeking a new agreement, besides women and children, whereby other categories that we have that we can swap," Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya told Al Jazeera on Monday.
The Israeli government is yet to officially confirm the truce extension.
Which prisoners and captives can be released under the extended deal?
Despite Israel not explicitly confirming the truce, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on X, formerly Twitter, that 50 additional Palestinian women are eligible for release from Israeli prisons.
This is an addition to the list of 300 prisoners slated for release that was published before the truce by Israel.
The Israeli Army Radio announced that Hamas released a new list of captives that will be freed. This is the first list that comes as a result of the extension of the pause.
Axios, a US-based news site, reported that the list contains 10 names.
Have there been other reactions to the truce extension?
The extension comes in the light of   between Qatar, the United States and Egypt to prolong the truce.
The White House welcomed the extension of the pause, adding that it hoped Americans would be among the captives to be released in the next phase of exchanges.
United Nations chief Antonio Guterres called the extension a 'glimpse of hope and humanity' but also said that two days is not enough time to meet the aid needs of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

Iran's Khamenei warns Israel that bombardment of Gaza could bring response

October 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah   has warned Israel that it must pull back from its attacks on Gaza or face the possibility of an expanded conflict.
Speaking on Tuesday, Khamenei accused Israel of committing 'genocide' in its assault on the besieged Gaza Strip, adding that Iran-backed forces across the region would not sit on the sidelines indefinitely.
"If the crimes of the Zionist [Israeli] regime continue, Muslims and resistance forces will become impatient, and no one can stop them," Khamenei said.
"Regarding the situation in Gaza, we all have a responsibility to react; we must react," he said.
The comments are the latest out of Tehran warning Israel and the United States that Iran-backed groups across the region, sometimes referred to as the 'axis of resistance', could join the current war between Israel and Hamas.
Iran's Fars News Agency also reported that Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Deputy Commander-in-Chief Ali Fadavi had issued similar warnings.
"The resistance front's shocks against the Zionist regime will continue," he said.
The question of potential expansion of the fighting to include not just Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza and receives some support from Iran, but more formidable Iran-backed groups such as   in southern Lebanon, has loomed over the 11-day war.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on Monday that supporting the Palestinians was Iran's foreign policy priority but that the armed groups make their own independent decisions.
Israel has pounded Gaza from the air since Hamas launched a surprise attack from Gaza on southern Israel on October 7, when hundreds of Hamas fighters breached the Israeli fence that surrounds Gaza and killed at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
After the attack, Israel   food, water, and electricity to the more than 2.3 million residents of Gaza and launched an aerial assault that has destroyed entire neighbourhoods, killed more than 3,000 people and wounded 12,500 others, according to Palestinian authorities.
Israel has said it intends to destroy Hamas and has mobilised hundreds of thousands of military reservists ahead of an expected ground offensive on Gaza. Military experts have warned that any ground offensive into densely populated areas of Gaza would be extremely challenging and could potentially lead to heavy losses on both sides.
The Israeli military suggested on Tuesday that it was considering other options as it prepares for "the next stages of the war" against Hamas.
"Everyone is talking about a ground offensive, but it could be something else," Israeli army spokesperson Richard Hecht said on Tuesday without providing further details.
'Any ground operation [by Israel into Gaza], starting such an operation, that could be a trigger' for other armed groups to join the war, Mahjoob Zweiri, a professor at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera.
The United States has   Iran-backed groups from joining the war, moving two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean and putting 2,000 of its troops on deployment alert. Israel has warned that any party that joins the fighting will pay a heavy price.
But a widening of the conflict could also cause considerable problems for Israel, which would be faced with the prospect of barrages of missiles from   and a two-front war that could stretch the capacity of its forces.

A  by Palestinian group Hamas on Israel – combining gunmen breaching security barriers and a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza – was launched at dawn during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah.
Saturday's   came 50 years and a day after Egyptian and Syrian forces launched an assault during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur in an effort to retrieve territoryIsraelhad taken during a brief conflict in 1967.
Here's how the brazen assault unfolded:
03:30 GMT – Covering rocket fire
At about 6:30am (03:30 GMT) Hamas   into southern Israel with sirens heard as far away as Tel Aviv and Beersheba.
Hamas said it launched 5,000 rockets in an initial barrage. Israel's military said 2,500 rockets were fired.
Smoke billowed over residential Israeli areas and people sheltered behind buildings as sirens sounded. At least one woman was reported killed by the rockets.
"We announce the start of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood and we announce that the first strike, which targeted enemy positions, airports, and miltary fortifications, exceeded 5,000 missiles and shells," Mohammed Deif, head of the al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said.

04:40 GMT – Dawn infiltration
The rocket attack served as cover for an unprecedented multi-pronged infiltration of fighters with the Israeli military saying at 7:40am (04:40 GMT) that Palestinian gunmen had crossed into Israel.
Most fighters entered through breaches in security barriers separating Gaza and Israel. But at least one Hamas soldier was filmed flying over in a powered parachute. A motorboat carrying fighters was seen heading to Zikim, an Israeli coastal town with a military base.
One video showed at least six motorcycles with fighters crossing through a hole in a metal barrier. A photograph released by Hamas showed a bulldozer tearing down a section of fence.
07:00 GMT – Fighting at Israeli military bases
Israel's military said at 10am (07:00 GMT) that Palestinian fighters penetrated at least three military installations around the frontier – the Erez border crossing, the Zikim base, and the Gaza division headquarters at Reim.
Hamas videos showed fighters running towards a burning building near a high concrete wall with a watchtower and fighters apparently overrunning part of anIsraeli military facility and shooting from behind a wall.
Saleh al-Arouri, deputy chief of Hamas in the occupied West Bank, issued a call to arms. 'We must all fight this battle, especially the resistance fighters in the West Bank,' he said in a statement.
Several capturedIsraeli military vehicles were later pictured being driven into Gaza and paraded there.
Border town raids
Fighters raided the Israeli town of Sderot, another community Be'eri, and the town of Ofakim, 30km (20 miles) east of Gaza, according to Israeli media.
Residents of southern Israel fortified their homes to function as bomb shelters and were using them as panic rooms.Israel's military ordered residents to shelter inside, saying on the radio "we will reach you".
By late evening, Israeli troops were still working to clear communities overrun by Hamas gunmen.

Casualties
Israel's national rescue service, Magen David Adom,   were killed as hospitals treated hundreds of wounded people
Medical sources in Gaza said at least 198 Palestinians were killed following Israeli air strikes.
Israel's foreign ministry accused Hamas gunmen of going house-to-house and killing civilians.
Taking captives
Israeli media reported gunmen seized hostages in Ofakim. Palestinian Islamic Jihad said it was holding Israeli soldiers, and Hamas social media accounts showed footage appearing to show captives being taken into Gaza.
One video showed three young men in vests, shorts and flipflops being marched through a security installation with Hebrew writing on the wall. Other videos showed female captives and Israeli soldiers being dragged from a military vehicle.
12:45 GMT – Israeli strikes
At 9:45am (12:45 GMT) blasts were heard in Gaza and at 10am (13:00 GMT) Israel's military spokesperson said the  .
17:00 – Fighting ongoing
Israeli air strikes continued late Saturday night as did rocket fire into southern Israel.
Israeli troops were still fighting Hamas gunmen in 22 locations near the Gaza Strip – a startling sign of the breadth of the assault.

Protesters block US military ship allegedly carrying weapons for Israel

Under dark skies and steady rain, hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators rallied at the Port of Tacoma, in Washington state, to block a military supply vessel they believe will carry weapons from the United States to Israel.
There, they fear any weaponry on board will be used in Israel's ongoing campaign against the Gaza Strip, where more than   have been killed.
'We want a ceasefire now. We want people to stop getting murdered now. We want a real examination and action on US foreign policy and US funding to Israel,' said Wassim Hage, one of the protesters at the Tacoma rally.
Hage works as a case manager and community outreach coordinator with the Arab Resource and Organizing Center (AROC), the advocacy group that organised the protests.
He said a confidential source tipped AROC off that the vessel would be loaded with weapons and military equipment and sent to Israel, as it continues its military offensive in Gaza.
Al Jazeera could not immediately confirm that allegation. In an email to the publication, Jeff Jurgensen, a Pentagon spokesperson, said that the ship was indeed used to support the 'movement of US military cargo'.
But he declined to offer further information. 'Due to operational security, the [US Department of Defense] does not provide further transportation, movement details or information regarding the cargo embarked on these vessels,' he wrote.

Second protest for vessel
In Tacoma, the ship, called the Cape Orlando, faced protesters of all ages in raincoats, puffer jackets and umbrellas marching outside its dock.
They waved the Palestinian flag, held signs saying 'Defend Gaza' and chanted slogans like 'Free Palestine' and 'Not another nickel, not another dime, no more money for Israel's crimes!'
Demonstrators used bicycles and cars, with their hazard lights blinking, to block traffic around the port. Seven Indigenous warriors in a ceremonial canoe also circled the waters nearby to block the ship.
Patricia Gonzalez from the Water Warriors Council of the Puyallup Tribe said she was motivated to take to the sea because she relates to the Palestinians' history with violence and displacement.
Her ancestors, she explained, were forced to attend Indigenous boarding schools, institutions designed to extinguish native cultures. The Canadian government and even Pope Francis have called the schools instruments of 'cultural genocide'.
Gonzalez said her community is still grappling with the intergenerational trauma of that history. 'When it comes to genocide, we definitely understand that,' she said.
'It touches our hearts really close,' Gonzalez said. 'Our ancestors went through that, and we're affected by it every single day. And we would never wish that upon another nation.'

Abby Brook, who is Jewish and anti-Zionist, helped organise Monday's rally. Her visits to Israel and occupied territories in the   and the   inspired her activism.
'When I was 18, I went to Palestine, and I saw the realities of the occupation and settler colonialism on the ground. I saw the checkpoints, I saw and talked to people about their experience of being displaced in the Nakba,' she said, using the term for the   in 1948.
'When you're seeing the reality that Palestinians live every day, there's no question about what's happening,' she said. 'And the reality that this is an apartheid state military occupation.'
She said a broad spectrum of people attended the 'block the boat' rally to interrupt the violence in Gaza. 'People wanted an opportunity to literally put themselves in the way of the genocide that's ongoing.'
This is the second week in a row that the Cape Orlando has faced attempts to scuttle its voyage.
Last Friday, when the Cape Orlando was docked in Oakland, California, three protesters latched themselves to the ship's ladder, delaying its departure for hours.
The US Coast Guard said in a statement  that it ultimately removed the three protesters after they 'reportedly trespassed' onto the vessel. They 'are currently under investigation for potential violations of federal law'.
Other protesters 'had breached the fence surrounding the pier that the Cape Orlando was moored to', the Coast Guard added, accusing some of 'tampering with mooring lines'.
Hage said the outcry against the Cape Orlando and its suspected cargo sends a strong message to President Joe Biden, who is currently campaigning for reelection in 2024.
'We're seeing some of the largest anti-war protests since the [George W] Bush years happening right now, and this is ahead of a very competitive election,' Hage said, referring to a presidency that oversaw wars in   and  .

US military assistance to Israel
Biden recently called on Congress to provide more than  , which is in addition to the $3.8bn the US already pledged to provide for 2023.
The US has been the   of military assistance to Israel since the country's founding in 1948. It funds approximately 16 percent of Israel's defence budget.
Following the   on Israel on October 7, Biden also   his intention to provide 'additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome', Israel's missile defence system.
However, it is hard to verify what weapons are being transferred from the US to Israel, according to Elias Yousif, a research analyst with the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center, a US-based think tank.
He pointed to a lack of transparency on the part of the Biden administration.
'The United States, at least officially, has made very few statements that detail what's being transferred,' he said. 'Unlike the war in Ukraine, where we have these nice fact sheets that the Department of State produces, there is no similar platform for us to go and look at arms transfers to Israel.'
That said, he believes there is a 'very high' likelihood that US weapons are being used in Gaza. 'Given the intensity of the fighting, I'd say it's almost certain that US weapons are involved in the fighting in Gaza.'

Lack of oversight
Sarah Yager, the Washington director for the nonprofit Human Rights Watch, said her group is pushing US lawmakers to provide oversight for military assistance to Israel.
'Congress, at the moment, their main job is to provide oversight of weapons sales,' Yager said. 'So if they're not asking questions about where these weapons are going and how they're being used, then they're not quite doing their jobs.'
Human Rights Watch has called on  countries like the US to suspend the transfer of weapons to Israel and Palestinian armed groups alike, 'given the real risk that they will be used to commit grave abuses'.
While Human Rights Watch blasted Hamas for targeting civilians in its October 7 attack on Israel, it likewise accused Israel of inflicting 'collective punishment' on the Palestinian people by dropping bombs on densely populated areas and cutting off essential supplies like food and water.
It also noted Israel's suspected use of white phosphorus, a toxic chemical that can burn at extreme temperatures and is illegal to use against civilians. Israel has denied using the chemical against civilians.
Yager said the US has a responsibility to ensure its money and weaponry are not being used to harm civilians.
'I think the first step is for Congress and the Biden administration to reassess where the weapons are going and if they are being used to commit violations of international law,' Yager said.
Despite their efforts, Hage said military personnel loaded cargo into the boat by nightfall on Monday.
While he said it was unfortunate they were unable to stop the cargo from entering the ship, Hage called the action a success because it delayed the vessel for most of the day. He added that a worker on the boat had told activists that he was moved by the protests and wanted to leave the vessel.
'We delayed this vessel by 12 hours and every day [that the cargo] is not used to bomb Palestinians is a win.'

Analysis: What's Israel's next target after Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital?

November 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli troops again entered the al-Shifa Hospital en masse on Thursday, for the   in as many days.
Their searches so far appear to have failed to uncover the alleged Hamas underground command centre that the Israeli side adamantly insists lies below the medical facilities.
Hamas, the hospital staff and several international organisations that had access to the hospital all assert that there are no military installations or soldiers at al-Shifa. They have said it only houses   and overworked nurses tending to the swelling numbers of patients in ever more difficult conditions, exacerbated by hundreds of terrified Palestinians who escaped from the destruction of their homes to the relative safety of the compound.
One of Israel's main claims, obviously intended to justify the attacks against Gaza hospital compounds, was that Hamas had nullified the protected status of medical facilities, using them for military purposes, thus giving Israel the right to attack and enter hospitals, all while blaming the Palestinian armed group.
The Israeli army went to great lengths to "prove" their allegations but the results so far don't back those up. Earlier this week reporters from a US TV station embedded with the invading forces were taken to   Children's Hospital by none other than its chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. The news team was shown a few Kalashnikovs and a motorcycle, of all things. Hagari bent over backwards trying to convince the media and the world that those were proof of his side's allegations.
His claims were mirrored at   by his subordinate, Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, who presented as 'evidence of terrorist activities' half a dozen AK assault rifles with magazines removed, a laptop and, in a Monty Pythonesque moment, two cans of WD40 anti-rust spray.
Anyone who spent time in the Middle East or in any war knows that the venerable Kalashnikovs are present virtually everywhere. It is normal, and legal, for hospitals to have armed guards to protect them from criminals, looters and anyone wanting to misuse them.
But apart from the ignorance of these claims and the huge discrepancy between demonstrating a few guns and claiming a main command centre from where Hamas conducted its operations, the location where those guns were allegedly found is curious: the gloating Conricus was adamant that they were hidden in the MRI room.
Anyone who has been examined by an MRI machine knows that they have had to remove every metallic object.
I asked a radiology specialist whether it would be possible to hide guns in that room. The response: 'The moment the machine was turned on, it would pull the guns and attach them to itself.' The MRI machine cannot function with rifles on it. Asking someone to believe that any hospital in Gaza would relinquish one of its main diagnostic machines to hide a grab bag with a few guns is simply absurd.
The Israeli army has been successful in   in Gaza, at least on the fringes of the city proper with a few incursions deeper into the urban areas, like the advance to al-Shifa, with fairly low numbers of casualties and limited material losses.
But it has failed to uncover - and show – any underground command centres or major tunnels. It was seen and filmed going down a few shafts, unopposed, but it did not appear to have gone underground in earnest.
Failing to produce the underground command centre, late on Thursday, the Israeli army showed a hole in the ground claiming it to be the entrance of a Hamas military tunnel. Until the media is allowed to enter and check for itself, it will have to balance that claim against the counter-suggestion that it is an access point for an underground electrical cable.
I have no doubt that there are Hamas  , communications nodes, power stations, storage facilities and – command centres.
If you take your cause underground, as Hamas obviously has, dedicating substantial resources and huge efforts to building the network, then you do construct an integrated network. Anything short of building several command facilities deep underground would be amateurish and outright foolish.
Every expert must be certain that such a 'beating heart of Hamas', as the Israeli army called it, is indeed ticking somewhere under Gaza. But apparently, maybe even certainly, not under al-Shifa Hospital.
As the aerial bombardment continues, many observers have failed to notice that apart from the raids on the hospitals, there has been very little movement on the ground for almost a week now. Big Israeli columns are dug in awaiting orders, but nothing indicates when they might advance further, nor in what direction and by what means.
For its part, Hamas has also been very quiet. It had put up some resistance to the initial Israeli advance, but kept it limited to opportunistic attacks that were intended more to probe the enemy and show the flag than to really stop the army before it got to the city. Its Qassam Brigades seem set to remain low-key, knowing that sooner or later the Israeli army will have to move under the ground to find and destroy the tunnels and command centres. They cannot win by remaining on the ground.
So, what happens next?
If the fighting is to continue, Israel will have to move first. Hamas can wait longer than the  . The Palestinians can let the Israelis simmer in their own stew, knowing that the displeasure at the failure to produce tangible results will further strengthen the voices of protest and opposition to the continuation of war.
There are signs that the army is aware of the need to show some success to the domestic public in Israel and is resorting to classic public relations stunts.
On Wednesday evening the 35th Paratroopers Brigade awarded the maroon berets to new recruits inside Gaza territory. There is hardly any military justification in choosing to hold the ceremony amid destroyed and depopulated buildings.
But someone in the Israeli army obviously hopes that the sentiment aroused by the symbolic raising of Israeli flags on occupied Palestinian territory – and several more flags were raised among the Gaza rubble on Thursday – might buy them some time before the public starts asking the unpopular question: 'Are we beating Hamas?'

The bodies of more than 1,000 Palestinians are trapped under the rubble of buildings that were destroyed by Israeli air attacks in  , the Hamas interior ministry says, warning of humanitarian and environmental crises.
Eyad al-Bozom, spokesman for the Hamas interior ministry, expressed concern over the rotting bodies in a statement on Monday, a day after the Palestinian civil defence team said in a statement on Sunday that more than 1,000 people were missing under the rubble after many others were pulled out alive 24 hours after buildings were struck.
Hundreds of Hamas fighters crossed the border into Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people and taking dozens captive. Israel has been carrying out air strikes in the Gaza Strip ever since.
The death toll in Gaza reached 2,750 on Monday while the number of those injured stood at 9,700, according to the enclave's health ministry.
Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed, reporting from Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza, said the Israeli bombardment continues in the city and other southern areas "despite Israel telling people to head south".
On Friday morning, the Israeli military  the north of the Gaza Strip, including the densely populated Gaza City. The directive applies to almost half of Gaza's 2.3 million residents.
"A short while ago, five ambulances arrived at a hospital in Khan Younis carrying the injured. Several, including women and children, had severe injuries. Civilians continue to bear the brunt of the Israeli aggression," she said.
"Hospitals, which have been using generators after Israel cut off electricity to Gaza, are informing us that they are running out of fuel and will be unable to operate in less than 24 hours."
Last Monday, Israel cut off Gaza's access to food, fuel, medicine and other supplies, announcing  .
'We are putting a complete siege on Gaza No electricity, no food, no water, no gas - it's all closed,' Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a video statement last week, justifying the move by describing Palestinians as 'beastly people'.

China's Wang urges peace in calls with Israeli, Palestinian counterparts

China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has told his Israeli counterpart that Beijing was "deeply saddened" by the large number of   in the escalating Israel-Hamas war and urged steps to prevent a further escalation in violence and establish a lasting peace.
The conflict, which erupted on October 7, represented a "major choice between war and peace", Wang told Eli Cohen in a phone conversation, China's state media reported on Tuesday.
The Chinese foreign minister, who is due to visit the United States later this week, acknowledged that every country had a right to self-defence, but "they should abide by international humanitarian law and protect the safety of civilians".
China has condemned the conflict that began after the Hamas armed group launched a surprise attack on Israel that killed at least 1,400 people.
The Israeli government responded with a declaration of war on the Hamas-controlled enclave of Gaza, cutting off its supplies of food, water and power and subjecting the densely populated territory to relentless bombardment. About 2.3 million people live in Gaza, and more than   have been killed in the past two weeks.
Wang told Cohen that China was "deeply concerned about the continued escalation of the conflict and the worsening situation, and deeply saddened by the large number of civilian casualties caused by the conflict," according to the Xinhua news agency.
China has sought to position itself as a peacemaker in the conflict, and its special envoy to the Middle East Zhai Jun is currently on a tour of the region.
On Monday, Zhai said Beijing was willing to do '  ' to promote dialogue, secure a ceasefire and restore peace. The envoy is due to travel to the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday and will remain in the region in the coming days, according to the foreign ministry.
Wang also spoke on the phone with Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki, voicing his concern and sympathy for the large number of civilians killed in Gaza, and the urgent need to stop the war. Al-Maliki is part of the Palestinian Authority that is separate from Hamas.
The Chinese foreign minister "condemned the Israeli attacks on hospitals and schools, which target civilians and violate international law, and stressed the need to stop the mass killing and the displacement policy", according to the WAFA news agency.
During his phone calls, Wang called for greater international cooperation to end the crisis and seek a lasting solution to the conflict. He reiterated China's support for a two-state solution.
The United Nations Security Council needed to "effectively shoulder its responsibility", he said, and that "countries outside the region, especially major powers, should be objective and impartial".
The Security Council has so far been unable to secure support for a ceasefire resolution after the United States   a resolution on the issue last week. The 15-member council is currently considering a new resolution drafted by the US, which is Israel's staunchest ally and backed its right to defend itself in the conflict with Hamas.
The UN General Assembly has now said it will hold a special emergency session on the conflict.
'When the Security Council is unable to act, the General Assembly must step up,' Dennis Francis, the president of the UN General Assembly, said after announcing he would convene the meeting of the 193-member body on Thursday.

October 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United Nations General Assembly has voted overwhelmingly in favour of a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian truce between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas.
The 193-member body passed the resolution, drafted by a group of 22 Arab countries, by a margin of 120 to 14, with 45 countries abstaining. The United States and Israel voted no.
Speaking before the vote, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said that voting against the resolution "means approving this senseless war, this senseless killing". Israel denounced the vote as 'infamy'.
The resolution is non-binding, but serves as a barometer of global opinion as fighting between Israel and Hamas nears the end of its third week, following an assault by Hamas on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people.
The body convened as  , where phone and internet service have been cut off and Israel has engaged in limited ground skirmishes before an expected invasion.
The General Assembly voted after the UN Security Council had failed to take action over two weeks, with the US and Russia   to block proposals supported by the other.
The adopted resolution calls for an "immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities' and "firmly rejects any attempts at the forced transfer of the Palestinian civilian population".
It also stresses the need to avoid a wider escalation of the fighting and demands increased humanitarian aid for Gaza, where only a small handful of trucks carrying aid have been allowed to enter over the last week.
A Canadian-introduced amendment to the resolution that would have added a condemnation of the Hamas attack did not receive the necessary two-thirds majority.
The resolution calls for the immediate release of all civilians being held hostage and condemns 'all acts of terrorism and indiscriminate attacks' including those on Israeli civilians, but does not name Hamas specifically.
Israeli UN ambassador Gilad Erdan said that 'a ceasefire means giving Hamas time to rearm itself,' and that the vote was not intended to bring peace but to 'tie Israel's hands'.
Speaking on Thursday, Erdan had said, "The only place this resolution belongs is in the dustbin of history".

Record 114 million people displaced globally, says UN

More than 114 million people are estimated to be displaced worldwide, a record number that speaks to the 'international community's failure to solve conflicts,' the United Nations has said.
"The number of people displaced by war, persecution, violence and human rights violations globally is likely to have exceeded 114 million at the end of September," UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said on Wednesday, marking an increase of 5.6 million from the end of last year.
The tally is the highest ever recorded by the agency since it began registering data in 1975.
UNHCR noted that in the first half of 2023, the main causes of displacement  were conflicts in Ukraine, Sudan, Myanmar, and the Democratic Republic of Congo; humanitarian strife in Afghanistan; and natural disasters and instability in Somalia.
Those newly displaced by mid-2023 included 11 million Ukrainians forced to   the  , and three million Sudanese caught in the crosshairs of a civil   pitting the Sudanese army against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

A growing number of Palestinians are adding to the total as well. In October 2023 alone, 1.4 million Palestinians were   by Israel's all-out   in the besieged Gaza Strip, which has reduced much of the territory to rubble, according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA.
UN refugees agency chief Filippo Grandi lamented the international community's failure to address the plight of displaced people and urged for a renewed push to forge solutions for them.
"As we watch events unfold in Gaza, Sudan and beyond, the prospect of peace and solutions for refugees and other displaced populations might feel distant," Grandi said in a statement.
"But we cannot give up. With our partners, we will keep pushing for – and finding – solutions for refugees."
While the outbreak of wars from Ukraine to Gaza has added to the displacement crisis, lingering humanitarian crises also play a major role.
The UNHCR report  found that nearly one-third of forcibly displaced people hail from three countries – Afghanistan, Syria, and Ukraine.
Syria continues to have the highest number of refugees, with 6.5 million people spread across 130 countries, as of mid-year, and the second-largest number of internally placed people, at 6.7 million.
Colombia – in the throes of an   between the military, armed groups, and paramilitary forces – has the largest number of internally displaced people, with 6.9 million.

Russia's Lavrov warns Israel-Gaza war could spark regional crisis

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that the conflict in Gaza risks spilling into a regional crisis, saying efforts to pin blame on Iran were adding fuel to the fire, according to Russia's Interfax news agency.
The remarks by Russia's top diplomat on Thursday came days after President Vladimir Putin said he believed no major actors wanted the war between Israel and Hamas to escalate.
This week, Russia proposed  amendments to a draft UN resolution that would have called for an "immediate full" ceasefire and ending attacks on civilians, but it was rejected by the Security Council. The final draft, which called only for humanitarian pauses, was vetoed by the United States, with Russia abstaining.
Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the draft had 'no clear call for a ceasefire' and would "not help to stop the bloodshed".

Russia has so far taken a careful approach to the latest escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that erupted on October 7, when Hamas fighters launched an unprecedented attack inside Israel that has killed some 1,400 people. Since the attack, about 3,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
Moscow offered a delayed statement affirming Israel's right to defend itself after Hamas's attack, which also killed at least 16 Russian citizens, but denounced Israel for responding with 'cruel methods'.
"In my view it is unacceptable," said Putin of Israel's air campaign in Gaza. "More than 2 million people live there [in Gaza]. Far from all of them support Hamas by the way, far from all. But all of them have to suffer, including women and children.'
Russia, which  an independent Palestinian state with occupied East Jerusalem as its capital, has not labelled Hamas a "terrorist" group like many Western states.
Putin, meanwhile, has over the years maintained   with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu despite key foreign policy clashes between the two states, including over the war in Syria.
'Failed US policy'
In his first public statement on the crisis on October 10, the Russian president pointed  the finger at the United States for playing a 'destructive' role saying the conflict is a 'vivid example' of Washington's failed policy.
'[They] tried to monopolise regulating [the conflict], but was unfortunately unconcerned with finding compromises acceptable for both sides,' Putin said, according to the Moscow Times.
Lavrov on Thursday also said efforts to blame Iran for the war were "provocations" in a likely reference to the US.
While the US has not directly blamed Iran for involvement in Hamas's attack, it has said Tehran is "broadly complicit" due to its longtime backing of the Palestinian group. US President Biden has also warned Iran to be "careful" not to escalate the conflict.
Iran celebrated the Hamas assault but insisted it was not involved.
As Russia engages in   with neighbouring state Ukraine, for which it has drawn  , analysts say it may also view the   as a welcome distraction.
'This conflict is a boon for Russia because it diverts a huge amount of attention of the United States and the West," Alexander Gabuev, director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told the AFP news agency.
On Thursday, Russia announced it had sent 27 tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza to be transported via Egypt following an   on Tuesday that killed hundreds of people. Putin called the "strike on the hospital" a "catastrophe" and pressed for urgent negotiations.

Israel 'expanding' troops in Gaza, Hamas to counter with 'full force'

October 28th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli forces have announced that they are "expanding" ground activities in northern Gaza as the besieged enclave faces the largest bombardment of Israeli attacks since the start of the war.
Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, has promised to meet attacks with "full force" in response to the ground operations overnight, with the Israeli army saying that its soldiers were still in the field on Saturday morning.
Israeli troops, backed by tanks, launched brief overnight incursions into Gaza on   and   night, but this third and largest offensive marks an escalation of their ground manoeuvres.
The increased fighting came amid heavy air bombardments and Israel knocking out   to create a near-blackout of information, largely cutting off the 2.3 million people in besieged Gaza from contact with the outside world.
United Nations officials, NGOs and media, including Al Jazeera, had difficulty reaching their teams on the ground.
At 07:00 GMT on Saturday, Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud managed to report live from Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
He described what Palestinians lived through as 'the most difficult and bloodiest night since the beginning of this war'.
Palestinian health authorities say that more than 7,326 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, when Israel began its aerial bombardment of the Strip. This, after Hamas launched an attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,405 people there.
Describing the events that took place overnight, Al Jazeera's Mahmoud said: 'It all started when the Israeli military spokesperson distributed a map asserting that al-Shifa hospital is the headquarters of Hamas leadership … Hamas then   it has any rooms underneath the hospital. An hour later, Gaza experienced a complete blackout.
'At about 7pm local time, a major attack by sea and land took place, concentrated on the northern part of the Gaza Strip, around the vicinity of al-Shifa hospital,' he said.
It was difficult to get an exact number of casualties at this stage, but 'we have been hearing reports that hundreds of people have been killed in those areas and emergency services were not able to get to them in time to help', Mahmoud said, adding that families in southern Gaza have also not been able to reach their relatives in the north.
'The problem with cutting Gaza from the outside world has made people feel it could be a genocide in the making without them knowing what has happened to their relatives,' he said.
Late on Friday, Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said ground forces were "expanding their activity" in Gaza and "acting with great force … to achieve the objectives of the war". Israel has amassed hundreds of thousands of troops along the border before an expected wider ground offensive.
Israel also claimed it had killed the man in charge of air operations for Hamas, describing him as one of the planners of the October 7 attacks, but this has not been independently verified.
Overnight into Saturday, warplanes struck 150 tunnels and underground bunkers in northern Gaza, the military said. Hamas's extensive underground installations, many of them located under Gaza City in the north of the territory, are seen as key targets of the offensive.
On Saturday, Hagari said the army was 'progressing through the stages' of the war in Gaza.
He said, 'Infantry, armoured, engineering and artillery forces are participating in the [military] activity, accompanied by heavy [air] fire.'
He also said Israel will allow aid trucks with food, water and medicine into the Gaza Strip during the day.
On Friday, the United Nations General Assembly  in favour of a non-binding resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas.
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the blackout was "making it impossible" for ambulances to reach the injured in Gaza.
"Evacuation of patients is not possible under such circumstances, nor to find safe shelter," he said in a post  on X, formerly known as Twitter. He said the WHO was not able to contact its staff and health facilities.

What is happening in Israel and Gaza? A look at the war with Hamas

October 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel on   threatened to track down and punish Hamas fighters while announcing a "total blockade" of the Gaza Strip following a surprise weekend attack by the armed Palestinian group.
Here is what you need to know about the recent developments:
What happened between Israel and Hamas on Saturday?
About   (03:30 GMT), many Israelis woke up to sirens after rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip.
Hamas said it   in an initial barrage. Israel's military said 2,500 rockets were fired.
The strength, sophistication and timing of the morning attack apparently surprised Israel, which has one of the world's most high-tech intelligence set-ups. Hamas fighters crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel with motorcycles, pick-up trucks, para-gliders and speed boats and attacked 22 locations.
Hamas military commander Muhammad Deif called the operation Al-Aqsa Storm. Hamas   told Al Jazeera that the group's military operation was carried out in response to a spate of provocations by Israeli politicians and settlers at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, among Islam's holiest sites, and to decades of violence and discrimination suffered by Palestinians at the hands of Israel.
How did Israel respond?
In response to the attack, Israel launched what it called Operation Swords of Iron, with its jets bombing the Gaza Strip.
"We  , and we will win," Netanyahu said in a televised statement on Saturday. He said the military would use all of its strength to destroy Hamas's capabilities. But he warned: 'This war will take time. It will be difficult.'
'Get out of there now,' he told Gaza Strip residents, who have no way to leave the tiny, overcrowded Mediterranean territory of 2.3 million people, which is blockaded by Israel by air, sea and land.
Air strikes intensified after nightfall, flattening residential buildings in giant explosions, including a 14-storey tower in central Gaza City.
Israel formally declared war on Sunday and on Monday announced that it would stop the supply of electricity, food, fuel and other essential commodities to the Gaza Strip, a decision that under international law amounts to a war crime.
The eruption of violence comes at a time when Israel has been facing the biggest protests in its history   to reform the Supreme Court in ways that critics say weakens the institution. He is doing so while he is on trial for corruption.
Israel's military also faces harsh questions for the country's worst intelligence failure in 50 years.
What does the declaration of war mean?
Mohammed Jamjoom, Al Jazeera's correspondent in West Jerusalem, said the Israeli cabinet's approval of Netanyahu's declaration of war means "the prime minister and the defence minister can essentially make decisions going forward without having to consult the cabinet when it comes to every specific action.'
'It essentially formalises it,  ,' he said.
The army has called up about 300,000 reservists.
Israel has hit more than 1,000 targets in Gaza as of Monday, its military said.
What is the current situation in Gaza?
Reporting from the Israeli coastal city of Ashdod, about 35km (20 miles) from the border with Gaza, Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford said the enclave is enduring enormous bombardment by Israeli forces with consecutive air raids.
'It is a massive, constant bombardment,' Stratford said.
He added that there is a huge Israeli military build-up near the border of the Gaza Strip, which 'would suggest that there is going to be some sort of ground invasion'.
More   have been displaced and thousands have taken shelter in United Nations schools. Buildings, mosques and offices have been targeted in the Israeli strikes.
Officials in Gaza's Ministry of Health said hospitals were expected to run out of fuel needed to power lifesaving equipment in two weeks.
How many people have been killed?
As of Monday,   in Gaza, according to health officials, and more than 800 Israelis have also been killed, according to Israeli medical services.
Could a ground offensive follow?
In his declaration of war, Netanyahu told Israelis: 'We will bring the fight to them with a might and scale that the enemy has not yet known,' and observers suggest a land invasion by Israel could be imminent.
Al Jazeera's senior political analyst, Marwan Bishara, warned that the situation between Israel and the Palestinians 'is going to get much worse' in the coming days.
Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader, told Al Jazeera the group was ready for 'the worst-case scenario'.
'We will continue to fight until we are rewarded with victory, freedom and independence,' he said.
'This is not a [hit-and-run] operation. We started an all-out battle,' he told Al Jazeera.
What has been the international response?
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the Ford Carrier Strike Group – which includes a host of ships and warplanes, including an aircraft carrier – to sail to the eastern Mediterranean to be ready to assist Israel.
The United Nations Security Council   on Sunday about the situation. It took no immediate action on a US demand that its 15 members condemn the Hamas attack.
China's ambassador said it was important to come back to a two-state solution, where Israel and an independent Palestine live side by side.
The European Union   suspending hundreds of millions of euros in aid for Palestinian authorities.
Fighters with Palestinian factions in Lebanon said they are eager to open a second front against Israel if the Shia-backed group Hezbollah leads the charge.
'Wherever [Israel] is ready for [the fight] to happen, it will happen,' said Ahmed Habet,   in Burj al-Barajneh, a refugee camp in Lebanon's capital, Beirut.

'Arrested, tortured and insulted', say workers returned to Gaza by Israel

November 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza Strip – The past few weeks have been deeply traumatic for Zaki Salameh, a Gaza resident who was working as a builder in an Israeli town when war broke out on October 7.
In the period following the unprecedented Hamas attack on Israeli army outposts and surrounding villages that day – and the relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip by Israeli forces ever since – Salameh has been arrested, tortured and interrogated.
The 55-year-old said he "deeply regrets" working in Israel. He declined to say where he was working for fear of reprisals by the Israeli army. He is one of at least   who had permits to work outside the enclave.
Salameh said he and other Palestinian workers from the Gaza Strip were arrested and tagged on October 8 before being taken to Ofer Prison on the outskirts of the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah. They were summoned for interrogation and tortured on what Salameh described as an electrical chair for several days.
"The Israelis asked us strange questions," he said. "They wanted to know where the Hamas tunnels are located, where the rocket launchers are placed and how the fighters move in and around Gaza."
Israeli authorities also interrogated the workers about their neighbours, their residential areas and who lives there, he continued, and threatened to imprison them for the rest of their lives.
"They wanted to know what we knew about the Al-Aqsa Flood operation," he said, referring to the surprise Hamas attack that killed 1,400 Israelis.
"Some of the young men were tortured and insulted in a very brutal way," Salameh said. "The questions were ridiculous. The Israelis know exactly who we are, and if we had any ties to Hamas, we wouldn't even be granted the work permits."
On Friday morning, the Israeli military said it had   from Gaza back to the coastal enclave through the southern Karem Abu Salem – or Karem Shalom – crossing.
This followed an Israeli government decision the previous night that these workers would not be granted work permits again.
'Israel is severing all contact with Gaza," the Israeli government press office said Thursday.
"There will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza. Those workers from Gaza who were in Israel on the day of the outbreak of the war will be returned to Gaza."

Expelled, arrested, rounded up
Gaza residents with permits allowing them to work outside the enclave were often labourers in construction while others worked in restaurants and malls. The money they earned was a source of some respite after Israel's 17-year blockade of the Gaza Strip has devastated the economy, resulting in an almost 50 percent unemployment rate.
Those workers granted permits were approved after a strict security examination by Israeli intelligence and the Israeli army. This meant that after a thorough background check, each worker was confirmed as a civilian with no political affiliations in the Gaza Strip or connections with Palestinian armed groups and resistance factions.
But as Israel began bombing the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army began expelling Gaza workers from their workplaces in Israeli cities.
Thousands of workers, like Salameh, were arrested and taken to Ofer Prison. Some were rounded up and held in other undisclosed locations with no communication with their families. Others were dumped at checkpoints in the occupied West Bank and made their way to Palestinian cities with only the clothes they were wearing.
Several Israeli human rights organisations, such as Gisha and HaMoked, said some of the workers had been illegally detained in military facilities in breach of international law. The organisations have sent petitions and individual inquiries to Israeli authorities demanding information on the whereabouts of the workers as well as those of other Gaza residents who had received medical permits to enter Israel and were also rounded up.

Fadi Bakr, who had been working in an Israeli mall, was fired from his job on October 7. The 29-year-old was granted a work permit a year and a half ago, and would usually spend a week at a time in Israel before returning to his family in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.
After  , Bakr made his way to the occupied West Bank and stayed in Hebron with other workers who, he said, were all distraught about the unfolding horrors in the Gaza Strip.
"I was very worried about my young children, my wife and my family," he said. "The intensity of the bombing in Gaza is unlike anything we've ever seen. It's cruel and brutal, and I could barely be in touch with my family."
Israeli forces stormed the building Bakr and the workers were staying in a few days later and took them to Ofer Prison.
The workers were detained for 20 days before they were released.
"For the first time, I feel very afraid because I do not know whether I will see my family again or not," he said.
"The Israelis interrogated us day and night about our relationship with the Hamas movement despite us having no connection to any political movement. We only came to work."
Workers also said they were mentally exhausted from thinking about their families under constant Israeli bombardment in the Gaza Strip.
Bakr said he was angered by the apparent lack of action taken by the Palestinian Authority to challenge their arrests or check on their welfare.
"How can cities, supposedly under the control of the Palestinian Authority, be raided without question by Israeli forces?" he asked bitterly. "We had no protection, and no Palestinian official came to our defence and did not even ask about how we were treated or about the possibility of our release from prison."

Fate of other workers unknown
The Israeli offensive has devastated the Gaza Strip and killed more than 9,000 people, including 3,826 children. More than 32,000 people have been wounded in the attacks on densely populated areas including refugee camps and residential homes. The United Nations estimated that 45 percent of Gaza's homes have been damaged or destroyed.
In addition to the blockade preventing Gaza's access to fuel, clean water and electricity, most of its infrastructure and main roads have been badly damaged.
As the workers crossed into the Gaza Strip on Friday, expressions of fatigue and exhaustion on their faces, they wondered about their families and how to reach them.
Salameh's family was living in the northern town of Beit Lahiya but were forced to leave due to the heavy bombardment. They are now sheltering in one of the UN-run schools in Khan Younis.
"There were no cars or other vehicles to take me from the far south to the central area," he said.
The roads are not safe, but he managed to hitch a ride on tuk-tuks and a horse-drawn cart that the relatives of other workers had brought with them to the crossing.

The fate of thousands of other Gaza residents who worked in Israel remains unknown.
Tasneem Aqel, who lives in Gaza City, last saw her father two weeks before October 7.
"I contacted him once during the first days of the war, and he told me that he was still working in Israel," she said. "But then the news began circulating about the expulsion of workers and their deportation to areas of the West Bank."
When Tasneem tried to call her father again, she got no response. She managed to call her father's friend, a fellow worker who had left with him through the northern Beit Hanoun/Erez crossing.
"All I found out was that my dad lost his phone while in Ramallah," she said. "His friend said he didn't have any news about him, so most likely, my father is still detained in prison."

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - Hundreds of staffers at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have signed a letter calling for an "immediate ceasefire"  , as a growing number of government employees voice dissent against US support for Israel's military offensive there.
The letter, which started circulating last week, reached 1,000 signatures on Wednesday, representing officials from across USAID's departments and overseas missions.
"While we appreciate and acknowledge efforts by USAID to call for an urgent humanitarian response in Gaza and understand that the Agency is working tirelessly to make this happen, we must remember that humanitarian assistance efforts and life-saving aid are largely rendered moot in situations of escalating and indiscriminate bombing and violence," the letter said.
USAID is responsible for overseeing the US's foreign development and humanitarian aid across the world.
In the letter, first revealed by Foreign Policy magazine and The Washington Post on November 3, the employees decry the "numerous violations of international law" and the mounting civilian death toll in Gaza.
"We believe that further catastrophic loss of human life can only be avoided if the United States Government calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of Israeli hostages, and the restoration of water, food, fuel, and electricity to the people of Gaza by the State of Israel," it reads.
"In the longer term, we call on the United States Government to join the international community and human rights organizations in holding all parties, including the State of Israel, to international law, which includes ending Israel's illegal occupation  of the Palestinian territories and settlements on occupied land."
In a statement to Al Jazeera shared on condition of anonymity, one of the USAID staffers who authored the letter voiced particular dismay at Washington's   a UN Security Council resolution last month calling for a humanitarian pause to the fighting.
The staff member also stressed that humanitarian aid to Gaza without stopping the war is not enough.
"Many humanitarian officials from many different conflict zones agree that aid cannot be a Band-Aid to a problem that requires a political solution. The people of Gaza need aid, but first they need the bombs to stop," the staffer said.
"Many USAID officials, particularly those in Middle East missions and bureaus, are tired of trying to programme foreign aid and humanitarian assistance in response to political and foreign policy errors and war crimes that the US [government] is supporting."
Bombardment and siege
The war started on October 7 after the Palestinian group Hamas   on Israel, killing over 1,400 people and taking more than 200 captives.
Israel retaliated with a relentless bombing campaign that has killed more than 10,000 people in Gaza.   against Palestinians has also soared in the West Bank amid a security crackdown by Israeli forces.
In addition to its bombing campaign in Gaza, the Israeli government has severely restricted the entry of food, water and fuel over the past month. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant promised to   on the territory, saying that his country is "fighting against human animals".
Although the humanitarian situation in Gaza is deteriorating, US President Joe Biden has rejected calls for a ceasefire while expressing "unwavering" support for Israel. The White House has repeatedly said that it is not drawing any "red lines" that might limit the Israeli military operation.
Rights groups and the UN, however, have urged Israel to stop the bombing, which has struck hospitals,  , churches, mosques and schools sheltering civilians.
Last week,   that the Palestinian people are at a "grave risk of genocide", underscoring that Israel's allies "bear responsibility and must act now to prevent its disastrous course of action".
The UN's Genocide Convention defines genocide as 'acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group', including killings and measures to prevent births.
The US provides Israel with at least $3.8bn in military aid annually, and   seeking more than $14bn in additional assistance to Israel this year.
USAID stresses assistance to Gaza
In an email about the letter, USAID spokesperson Jessica Jennings said that the agency appreciates the "ongoing dialogue" with staff and partners and welcomes its team to "share their opinions with leadership".
USAID administrator Samantha Power is an outspoken proponent of US interventions to prevent genocide across the world.
Jennings also highlighted USAID's humanitarian efforts in Gaza and the US administration's push to deliver aid to the territory, including $100m in assistance   last month.
"The United States continues to work with Israel, Egypt, the UN and other partners to facilitate rapid and sustained assistance flow into Gaza," Jennings said.
"Food, fuel, water, medicine, and other essential services must be restored. While the number of trucks entering Gaza continues to increase, it is not nearly enough."
As the fighting in Gaza intensifies, calls for a ceasefire have been growing louder within the US government.
In Congress, where the overwhelming majority of lawmakers oppose efforts to push for an end to the fighting, hundreds of staffers penned a letter urging a ceasefire last month.
"Millions of lives hang in the balance, including the 2.3 million civilians — half of whom are children — in Gaza, civilians in Israel, and Jews and Muslims around the world," the letter, first reported by Politico , warned.
On Wednesday, dozens of staffers on Capitol Hill staged a walkout to renew that appeal.
"We demand our leaders speak up, call for a ceasefire, the release of all hostages and an immediate de-escalation now," one anonymous staffer — sporting a medical mask and sunglasses — said in front of the US Capitol in a video shared on social media.
"We are gathered here today to mourn the loss of every single beautiful, innocent life."
Congressional staffers should not be silenced.

In October, Josh Paul, a senior official at the Department of State, resigned in protest against US policy towards Israel.
"Washington is giving unambiguous and unquestioned military support to Israel despite what many in the region see as a deep injustice," Paul   last month.
"We have tried to frame ourselves as an honest broker, but we're removing what little credibility we had left in that role."

Israel's military says Gaza City surrounded, rejects ceasefire calls

November 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel's military has announced that its forces have surrounded Gaza's main city while rejecting growing international calls for a ceasefire to halt bloodshed in the besieged Palestinian territory.
Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Thursday that Gaza City has been encircled nearly a week after its forces expanded ground operations in the Hamas-governed enclave.
"Israeli soldiers have completed the encirclement of the city of Gaza, the centre of the Hamas terror organisation," Hagari told journalists.
Hagari said a 'ceasefire is not currently on the table at all'.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who last week said the war against Hamas had entered the 'second stage' amid an escalating ground war, said on Thursday night that Israeli forces were at the 'height of the battle'.
'We've had impressive successes and have passed the outskirts of Gaza City,' he said. 'We are advancing.'
Israel's military said in a separate statement on social media that its priorities 'are to bring home the children, women and men who are being held hostage by Hamas and to make sure Hamas will no longer have the ability to attack Israelis'.
Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, warned in response that Gaza would be the 'curse of history for Israel' and that Israeli soldiers entering the enclave would go home "in black bags".
Israel's announcement came after United States President Joe Biden voiced support for a humanitarian 'pause' in fighting to allow the release of captives held by Hamas.
White House officials later clarified that the Biden administration did not support a full ceasefire, but would press for temporary, localised pauses in fighting to allow the aid and release of hostages.
On Thursday, seven UN special rapporteurs issued a statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, expressing their concern that Palestinians face a 'grave risk of genocide'.
Israel's assault on Gaza has come under growing condemnation since its forces earlier this week carried out successive air raids on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.
At least 195 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded in the strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to officials in the Hamas-governed enclave.
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights   given the "high number of civilian casualties" and "the scale of destruction" at the refugee camp.
Israel said the air raids had targeted a Hamas commander and a 'vast' network of tunnels under the site of the camp.
At least 9,061 Palestinians have been killed in the bombardment of Gaza, which Israeli forces launched in response to Hamas's October 7 attacks on communities in southern Israel.
At least 1,405 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Hamas's surprise attack involving incursions from land, sea and air, according to Israeli officials.

Fighting Hamas puts Israeli protests on ice, but political divide remains

Saturday's surprise attack by Hamas has left Israelis in shock, outraged at a government many feel failed to protect them – but analysts say the political fallout will have to wait as the army wages war in Gaza.
The attack, which Israel's intelligence services appear to have completely missed, marked 'a colossal failure', said retired Colonel Miri Eisin, the managing director of Israel's International Institute for Counter-Terrorism.
'Critical voices will come out, but that's not the focus in Israel right now. We need to get through this [war], then we will start pointing fingers,' she told Al Jazeera. 'It will be harsh and horrible, but it will [come] after we've stabilised.'
Hamas launched the unprecedented operation at dawn on Saturday, firing thousands of rockets into southern Israel, sending fighters deep into Israeli territory and abducting more than 100 Israelis.
Israel swiftly responded with air attacks on the overcrowded and besieged Gaza Strip.
Israeli air attacks in Gaza have killed more than 560 people, including 20 children. About 800 Israelis have been killed in the Hamas attack, according to media reports.

Shocked public backs 'dramatic' response
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to announce that Israel would 'exact an immense price from the enemy' in Gaza and threatened to turn the Palestinian enclave into a 'deserted island'.
Israel has placed the impoverished territory of 2.3 million people under a land, air and sea blockade since 2007 and launched repeated assaults on it to fight  , which controls the Gaza Strip, and other armed groups, arguing it needs to act decisively to stop them firing rockets into Israel.
But Israeli operations have not dislodged the armed group from power or stopped the rocket fire as Palestinians have suffered most of the casualties.
The unprecedented nature of Saturday's attack was driven home by videos of Israeli hostages and of revellers at a music festival near Gaza fleeing into the Naqab Desert after Hamas fighters attacked with paragliders, killing up to 250 people.
Julia Elad-Strenger, an assistant professor in politics at Israel's Bar Ilan University, said the Israeli public was reeling and would unite behind a tough response.
'The great shock caused by Hamas abducting and attacking civilians in such an organised way, within Israeli territory, gives very strong legitimisation across the political spectrum for a quite dramatic military operation in Gaza,' she told Al Jazeera.
But the government also faces severe criticism, even from within, for being caught off guard.
The crisis is a particularly heavy blow to Netanyahu, who has been beleaguered by repeated political crises and corruption charges that threaten to land him in prison.
Michael Stephens, an associate fellow at the United Kingdom-based defence and security think tank Royal United Services Institute, said the attack was 'politically devastating for Netanyahu'.
'This government was meant to be the one that took security seriously, and they've delivered nothing,' he said.
'There's no way they come out of this looking good. It would be very, very difficult for an Israeli PM to survive this.'
A new government?
Yet Israel's   has a well-earned reputation as a great survivor, and it may be too soon to write his political obituary.
The same day as the attack, Netanyahu and his bitter rivals, opposition leaders Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz, publicly mulled the idea of forming a broad emergency government.
It would replace an administration widely seen as one of the most   in Israel's history, both in terms of its policies towards Palestinians and in terms of its domestic agenda – notably a controversial plan to  , which plays a key role in checking executive power.
The reform plan, backed by some of Netanyahu's most far-right coalition partners, has prompted months of   who fear it would spell an end to their democracy.
Elad-Strenger said that, were Lapid and Gantz to join the government, it could dilute or sideline its far-right members. That would in turn give Netanyahu a way to drop the judicial reforms, which have damaged his standing with voters, but still allow him to remain in power.
'Of course, this could also serve the opposition because it would push the more extreme forces out,' she said.
'All the numbers we have show that if this government falls, they won't have another opportunity to have such a strong foothold.'

Anti-Netanyahu protests: on hold for now
That scenario may take months to materialise if there is a prolonged conflict in Gaza.
In the meantime, the anti-Netanyahu protests are on hold. Organisers cancelled Saturday evening's protests, citing the security situation and voicing support for the army.
Elad-Strenger said some people had already started trading accusations with the right accusing the protest movement of creating instability and leaving the military ill-prepared, while the left blamed Netanyahu and his ministers' provocations against Palestinians.
But Eisin said politicians and protesters alike had largely pressed pause on the 'blame game'.
'We need to be together to fight,' she said. 'All has been put aside. Many of the protesters are reservists [in the armed forces]. They all went when they were called up. Nobody said they're not going.'
However, there appears to be a high likelihood that once the situation calms down, the protests will return.
'Israelis have a huge amount of anger at the government for letting them down. There's a sense that state has been withering away from within under Netanyahu's watch,' Stephens said.
'This war will happen, Israelis will unite. But you can already tell that there's a desire for retribution, that something is very rotten in the state and all the way through the system, and there will be a price to be paid politically.'

'His voice will go on - that we can guarantee. All our voices will go on, and we'll continue to cover this assault to get the truth out every day,' said Almisshal.
When Dahdouh bid farewell to his family, they were lying on the floor, with no room elsewhere as the number of dead pile up in hospitals across the strip.

Americans want US to help get Gaza civilians out of harm's way: Survey

October 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A bipartisan majority of Americans wants the United States to help get Palestinian civilians out of harm's way in Gaza amid Israel's attacks, but the US public's support for Israel in the conflict appears stronger than in the past, a Reuters/Ipsos poll finds.
The results of the two-day poll, which closed on Friday, showed 78 percent of respondents – including 94 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of Republicans – agreed with a statement that "American diplomats should actively be working on a plan to allow civilians fleeing fighting in Gaza to move to a safe country".
Twenty-two percent of respondents disagreed.
Hamas fighters burst across the Gaza barrier fence into Israel on October 7, killing 1,300 and abducting dozens more, including Americans.
Israel has responded with the most intensive air attacks of its 75-year-old conflict with the Palestinians, killing at least 2,750 and sparking a humanitarian crisis.
US and global media have been awash with images of massacred Israelis, including graphic accounts of Hamas atrocities, as well as Palestinians in the Gaza Strip searching for survivors after Israeli air strikes levelled neighbourhoods.
Support among Americans for Israel's position in the conflict was higher in the new poll than it was in a survey in 2014, when Israeli ground forces surged into the coastal enclave in a clash with Hamas aimed at stopping rocket fire into Israel. The current war has escalated into a much more serious, far-reaching conflict.
Forty-one percent of respondents in the new poll, which closed as Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, was preparing a ground invasion into Gaza, said they agreed with a statement that "the US should support Israel" in its conflict with Hamas, while 2 percent said, "the US should support the Palestinians".
In a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted during the 2014 conflict, 22 percent of respondents said the US should support Israel's position, and 2 percent wanted support for the Palestinians' position.
Support for Israel's position in the new poll was strongest among Republicans, with 54 percent of the party backing Israel's position compared to 37 percent of Democrats.
In recent years, Democrats have grappled with internal friction between pro-Israel moderates and a faction of progressives increasingly critical of Israel, especially for its treatment of the Palestinians and expansion of Jewish settlements by the country's far-right government.
Younger Americans
Large shares of respondents in the poll backed other stances in the conflict, including 27 percent who said the US "should be a neutral mediator" and 21 percent who said the US should not be involved at all.
About 40 percent of respondents under age 40 said the US should be a neutral mediator, roughly double the 19 percent of people age 40 and above who said the same.
Those under 40 were also less likely to back supporting Israel than were older Americans, a potentially worrisome sign for Israel, which has long counted on Washington for weapons aid and international diplomatic support.
About 20 percent of respondents under 40 backed supporting Israel, compared to 53 percent of older respondents.
The poll results illustrated a high level of concern among Americans over the plight of ordinary Palestinians in the Hamas-ruled territory of more than two million people.
Eighty-one percent of respondents agreed with a statement that "Israel should avoid killing civilians in its retaliatory strikes against Hamas", compared to 19 percent who disagreed.
US officials have urged Israel to protect civilians while pointing the finger directly at Hamas, which Washington designates a "terrorist" group, for what they describe as using Gaza residents as human shields.
Israel has insisted its military takes every precaution to minimise civilian casualties.
As the deaths mount, no neighbouring state or other third country so far has shown any willingness to take in large numbers of Gaza refugees.
But US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza would reopen and the US was working to get humanitarian assistance through it to ease the crisis.
The US on Saturday advised its 500 to 600 dual nationals in Gaza to move closer to the crossing for possible safe passage into Egypt.
Israel has imposed a full-scale blockade around the rest of the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli military sparked an international outcry last week when it ordered all residents of Gaza City to evacuate. Hundreds of thousands have already fled south.
About 69 percent of poll respondents said they were following news about the fighting "very closely" or "somewhat closely".
When presented with a list of options for who is most responsible for the current conflict, 49 percent of respondents picked Hamas, far more than the 9 percent who picked Israel.
The war, which threatens stability in a region that is critical for global energy supplies, could be a significant political issue as US President Joe Biden seeks re-election in 2024.
While Biden has offered staunch support for Israel, he has also urged it to follow the laws of war. On Sunday, he said on social media that "the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas's appalling attacks".
Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination to challenge Biden in the election, criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a lack of preparation for the Hamas attack, saying "they've gotta straighten it out".
The Reuters poll showed Americans have little faith in the ability of either Biden or Trump to solve the crisis.
Just 26 percent of respondents said they trusted Biden more "to broker peace in the Middle East", compared to 32 percent who picked Trump. The rest said they did not trust either or did not know who would be better.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online and nationwide, gathering responses from 1,003 US adults. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about four percentage points.

Reuters, Al Jazeera journalists 'targeted' in Lebanon strike: Press group

October 30th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A Reuters journalist killed in strikes near the Israel-Lebanon border was deliberately targeted along with six other media workers injured in the attacks, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has said.
Video journalist Issam Abdallah, 37, was killed in southern Lebanon on October 13 while covering fighting between Israel's military and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.
Six other journalists, including Al Jazeera cameraperson Elie Brakhia and reporter Carmen Joukhadar, were wounded in the two air attacks, which hit the village of Alma al-Shaab in quick succession.
'Two strikes in the same place in such a short space of time (just over 30 seconds), from the same direction, clearly indicate precise targeting,' RSF said on Sunday, citing the preliminary results of an investigation based on video footage and ballistic analysis.
'It is unlikely that the journalists were mistaken for combatants, especially as they were not hiding: in order to have a clear field of vision, they had been in the open for more than an hour, on the top of a hill. They were wearing helmets and bullet-proof waistcoats marked 'press'. Their car was also identified as 'press' thanks to a marking on the roof, according to witnesses.'
While RSF did not directly attribute responsibility to Israel, the press freedom advocacy organisation said journalists had witnessed Israeli military helicopters near the scene and the strikes had come 'from the direction of the Israeli border'.
The Al Jazeera Media Network has accused Israel's military of deliberately targeting the journalists to silence the media, condemning the attacks as part of a pattern of 'repeated atrocities' against journalists.
The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Israel's military has not acknowledged responsibility for the strikes but a spokesperson previously said officials were 'very sorry' for Abdallah's death and were 'looking into it".
Last week, the wife, son, daughter and grandson of Wael Dahdouh, Al Jazeera Arabic's bureau chief in Gaza, were   on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza.
Al Jazeera Media Network said in a statement that it condemned the "indiscriminate targeting and killing of innocent civilians in Gaza, which has led to the loss of Wael Al-Dahdouh's family and countless others."
Israeli officials earlier this year apologised for killing Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh after admitting there was a 'high possibility' she had been struck by an Israeli soldier's bullet. Israel has declined to pursue charges against any individual over the veteran Palestinian-American reporter's death.
At least 34 Palestinian journalists have been killed in Israeli air attacks since Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-governed Gaza Strip.
At least four Israeli journalists were killed and one retired journalist captured in Hamas's surprise attack on communities in southern Israel, according to the International Federation of Journalists.

At least 25 people were killed in Israeli attacks on a Gaza City school, said the director of   where the casualties were taken.
"We received 25 martyrs from Al-Buraq School after missile and artillery strikes targeted the school this morning," director Mohammad Abu Salmiya of Gaza's largest hospital complex told Al Jazeera on Friday.
While the Reuters news agency reported the director as saying at least 20 Palestinians had been killed, AFP news agency put the number at about 50 people.
Video footage shared on social media showed dozens of bodies strewn across the school in the Al-Nasr neighbourhood in the aftermath of the attack. People whose homes had been destroyed were sheltering in the school.
The Israeli army has intensified its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, repeatedly targeting schools, mosques and hospitals.
Last week, an Israeli air missile   run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing at least 15 people and injuring 54, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health.
Thousands of people displaced due to Israel's relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip had taken refuge at the Al-Fakhoora School. That was the third major attack on the  .
It came hours after a deadly strike on the Osama bin Zaid School sheltering displaced families in the Al-Saftawi area north of Gaza City, killing at least 20 people, according to local media.
At least 11,078 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the death toll stands at more than 1,400.
The Israeli strikes have   more than 50 percent of housing units across Gaza, according to officials. The United Nations humanitarian office said in a statement that if there is a "hell on Earth, it is northern Gaza".

Erdogan in tense talks in Germany as divisions over Gaza war deepen

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was on a brief and tense visit to Germany amid deep differences between the two NATO allies over the  .
Erdogan has called Israel a 'terror state' and pointed to its Western allies, including Germany, for supporting the military's "massacres" in Gaza.
On Friday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz underlined Israel's  .
"Our solidarity with Israel is not up for discussion," he said at a joint news conference with Erdogan.
"We don't owe anything to Israel, so we can speak freely," Erdogan said, referring to Germany's responsibilities in the Holocaust and how Berlin can influence its relationship with Israel. "If we were in debt, we could not talk so freely. But those who are in debt cannot talk freely," he said.
The Turkish leader also lashed out at Israel over its relentless  , saying that attacks on children and   had no place in the Jewish holy book.
"Shooting hospitals or killing children does not exist in the Torah, you can't do it," Erdogan told reporters.
Ismail Thawabta, the director general of the government media office in Gaza, told reporters on Friday that the total number of Palestinians killed since the war broke out on October 7 has exceeded 12,000, including 5,000 children.
Frosty start
This was Erdogan's first visit to Germany since 2020, when he attended a conference on Libya in Berlin.
Before the visit, the Turkish leader   his condemnation of the Israeli assault on the besieged Gaza Strip, saying it had "unlimited support" from the West.
He had previously called for Israeli leaders to be tried for war crimes at the International Court of Justice in The Hague and repeated his view - and Turkey's longstanding position - that Hamas is not a 'terrorist organisation' but a political party that won the last Palestinian legislative elections held in 2006.
Since October 7, when Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel killing  , and prompting the Israeli government to retaliate with a devastating air and ground assault on Gaza, the Turkish president has hardened his criticism of Israel.
After the Hamas attack, Scholz travelled to Israel to offer Germany's support.
This month, Germany announced a   of Hamas activities, as well as those of the German branch of Samidoun, known as the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, claiming it 'supports and glorifies' groups including Hamas.
'In our country,   is not permitted in any way,' said Scholz at the news conference.
'I would like to emphasise there are five million Muslims living in Germany and they have a place here,' he added.
Erdogan rebuked suggestions that his attacks on Israel had anti-Semitic undertones.
"For us, there should be no discrimination between Jews, Christians and Muslims in the region. I have fought against anti-Semitism. I am a leader who is leading this fight," he said.
German authorities have prohibited  in what they said are efforts to prevent public anti-Semitism and curb disorder.
Uncomfortable partners
The two countries have always been, as characterised by Scholz's spokesman, 'uncomfortable partners'.
Berlin has been a loud critic of Erdogan's clampdown on domestic dissent while recognising that getting regional power Turkey onside was necessary to tackle thorny issues.
Despite their differences, economic cooperation between the two countries has continued, with bilateral trade reaching a record 51.6 billion euros ($56.2bn) in 2022.
Germany is home to the largest Turkish diaspora abroad. A majority of the Turkish community of three million are supporters of Erdogan.
Erdogan's stance sparked questions in Germany about the wisdom of hosting the Turkish leader at this time, with the opposition conservatives and even the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), a member of Scholz's coalition, urging the chancellor to scrap the invitation.
While much of the news conference was dominated by the Israel-Hamas conflict, the two leaders also spoke about the  , which Turkey helped broker before Russia withdrew from it.
They were set to attempt to find common ground on a migration pact struck in 2016 between the European Union and Turkey to stem arrivals in Europe.
Erdogan linked continuing discussions on that deal, which some European countries would like to revive and amend, to   process, which was been on ice.
He also hoped to win Scholz's backing to revive talks on modernising Turkey's customs union with the EU, and liberalise visas for Turkish citizens ahead of upcoming municipal elections where he hopes to win back the country's largest cities including its capital Ankara and Istanbul.
Turkey has wanted to buy 40 Eurofighter Typhoon jets, which, according to Turkey's Ministry of Defence, co-manufacturer Germany has opposed.

She lost her home, had to send her kids away, but keeps reporting on Gaza

Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip – Between her live presentations on TV, Khawla al-Khalidi takes a sip of water, or coffee if it's available, and searches her phone for updates.
Her husband, Baher, adjusts her hijab, murmuring words of encouragement, then stands beside the camera as al-Khalidi prepares for another live update.
The 34-year-old journalist, like many of her colleagues, practically lives at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which has become a makeshift bureau because it is one of the few places where the internet works and the journalists can charge their phones, laptops and other electronics.
"I've always loved journalism, and I've been in this industry for 11 years," al-Khalidi said. "I used to produce and present the morning show for Palestine TV, and since this war started, I've also been given the opportunity to work for [the Saudi-owned] Al Hadath and Al Arabiya channels as well."

Al-Khalidi has not stopped working since October 8, a day after Israel began its offensive on the Gaza Strip after unprecedented attacks by Hamas on army bases and towns in southern Israel.
In the midst of war and its constant developments, any stability and daily routines are thrown out the window.
Al-Khalidi had barely worked a day in her usual office before all of the Gaza Strip was threatened with air raids. Her Palestine TV colleagues evacuated, and she began working from home, doing live interviews with various channels over the phone.
One night at nearly midnight during the first week of bombing, she was doing her last phone interview of the day when she noticed Baher signalling her.
The Israelis were going to target their neighbourhood, he told her, and they needed to leave right away.
"We got a message saying we had to evacuate in 20 minutes," she said. "I ended my phono by telling them that, and then I walked around the house in a daze, not knowing what to pack or take with me."
Dream home destroyed
The couple and their four children – the eldest is 12 and the youngest five – stayed for about a week at al-Khalidi's parents' home in Gaza City. On the second day, al-Khalidi got the news that her beloved home, the one that she and Baher had built together over 10 years, had been destroyed.
"My family tried to play it down at first, saying: 'Oh, it was just the kitchen that caught fire,' or that it was partially damaged by shrapnel," she recalled. "But it was all gone.
"I cried, of course, then calmed down. A couple of days later, I cried again, then pulled myself together. I knew that this is the situation in Gaza now and that everyone is going through the same experience."
Al-Khalidi's paintings were hung up by Baher on the walls of their home. It was their dream house, and everything inside from the furniture to the interior decor to what filled the nooks and crannies were all chosen and made lovingly by the husband and wife.

"It didn't hit me at the beginning that my house was gone," al-Khalidi said. "I feel it more now, every time we get displaced farther and farther away.
"You realise that it's not about the money or the decor or the paintings, but it's about having a private and secure space for you and your family to be around each other."
The family woke up one morning to the sound of violent bombardment on the street. An Israeli air attack had targeted a house metres away, reducing it to rubble. The windows of al-Khalidi's parents' home shattered from the blast, and the journalist decided to leave for al-Maghazi refugee camp in the centre of Gaza to stay with her brother's in-laws.
Al-Khalidi continued to work. She had her car, and the roads were still not as dangerous or damaged as they are now.
One day, as she was driving to the Rafah border crossing to cover the movement of the second group of patients going to Egypt for treatment, she heard on the radio that the Afaneh family home in al-Maghazi was targeted.
"That house is directly next to the house that my husband and children are in," she said. "I tried calling my husband and brother, but no one was answering their phones, so naturally, I assumed the worst."
She turned her car around and drove straight to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, her heart in her throat.
Baher was at the entrance, immediately reassuring her that everyone was fine, save for a few stitches on her son Karam's head. The couple then decided it was best to send their children to Rafah to stay with their other grandparents while they remained in Deir el-Balah.

'My backbone, my wings'
For the past 12 days, the couple would talk to their children six or seven times a day, at any opportunity when the phone lines weren't down.
"They would tell me every detail of their lives from the lack of water and the little food they had to playing with their cousins and neighbours and what they did with their uncle that day," al-Khalidi said. "Their main complaint was that they couldn't shower."
Every day, she wakes up at dawn with her husband, prays, and then they set off to the hospital about 1km (0.6 miles) away, walking hand in hand. At the hospital grounds, she greets her colleagues, then connects to the internet to gather the information for her first live at 8am for Al Arabiya. She keeps going until her last live at 4pm.
"I report about 18 times a day in front of the camera," she said. "I'm exhausted by the end of it and like to leave the hospital before it gets dark. My husband and I walk back, and after changing my clothes and a quick bite, I do phone interviews until 10pm."
She is full of praise for Baher, who is a prosecutor but hasn't worked since the war began.

"I wouldn't be able to do half the things I am doing now if it wasn't for him," she said, smiling.
"He's encouraged me from the first day, saying that I have the ability to keep working and to get my message out there, which not every journalist has."
It also comforts her to be around him, whether simply feeling his presence among the many journalists, patients and displaced people living in the hospital's courtyard or when he brings her water or coffee or food between her reports. He watches every one of her lives and gives her feedback.
"He's my backbone, my wings," al-Khalidi said. "You know the old adage that behind every great man is a great woman? Well, I also believe that behind every great woman is a greater man. I'm blessed to have him."
The couple went to Rafah to see their children on Monday and realised that it was not safer than other areas because Israeli warplanes and tanks had targeted the city, so they decided to bring the children back to al-Khalidi's aunt's house in Deir el-Balah, where the couple had been staying.
"I was so excited to see them again," she said. "My daughter Rama said she hasn't hugged me in so long. I thought, 'You know what, we either die together or live together.'"

'Palestinian journalists the best in the world'
The biggest challenges that journalists face in doing their jobs during the war are the lack of transportation, the slow and unreliable internet connectivity, and the lack of electricity. Many of the male reporters at the hospital haven't seen their families in weeks and sleep on mattresses in the courtyard. With winter around the corner, the absence of proper shelters has become a main concern.
"It seems like every day I hear about a colleague whose family members were killed in an attack or of their own deaths," al-Khalidi said. "This makes me think, 'Will I be next? Will my family be next?'"
What motivates her to keep working, she says, is the hope that one day she will look into the camera and say: "And now, Palestine has been liberated."
"For this time, I want to say: 'The war is over. Go back to your homes,'" she said. "Who said people in Gaza are used to conflict and strife? We're definitely not made to live in hospitals or be displaced over and over or run from the bombs in the sky."

She is convinced that what makes Palestinian journalists continue their work while facing such danger and witnessing unspeakable horrors is their belief in Palestinian freedom and self-determination.
"I consider Palestinian journalists to be the best there is in the world, from their bravery, their presentation, their language skills, their experience, their strength," al-Khalidi said.
"This war has made me appreciate all of life's little blessings," she added. "It also strengthened my resolve, and I will definitely build another house, an even better and more beautiful home than the one before."

How the Israel war, blockade affects mental health of Palestinian children

The children of the Gaza Strip know very well what suffering is. From birth, they have lived under a partial Israeli blockade, poverty and violence.
And now, with the escalation of the Israeli offensive and a   following the   by Hamas fighters, their suffering will likely only get worse.
Dr Iman Farajallah, a psychologist in the United States and Dr Mamoun Mobayed, a psychiatrist in Qatar, have extensive experience researching and assisting with childhood trauma.
Al Jazeera spoke to them about Israel's war on Hamas and the mental health effects living in the Gaza Strip has on children.
Here's what you need to know about the trauma children in Gaza are coping with:
How does living in the Gaza Strip affect the mental health of children?
Farajallah born and raised in Gaza before moving to California two decades ago, knows first-hand what it is like to live under the "Israeli occupation".
'That's why I became a psychologist – to help others living with trauma," she said.
In a research paper,  Farajallah published last year on the impact of war on Palestinian children, she found that children who survive wars do not emerge unscathed and can pay a high price psychologically, emotionally, or behaviourally.
Her research found that 95 percent of children from the Gaza Strip showed symptoms of anxiety, depression and trauma.
"They watch their family members, neighbours, and friends being killed, this causes anger and frustration in them, they tend to be more aggressive and suffer from depression, anxiety, and continuous traumatic stress disorder," she said.
Now specialising in treating refugees and minority groups for trauma, Farajallah returns to Gaza 'as often as possible' and has witnessed how childhood trauma stays with children into their teens.
She recalled meeting two girls recently, a 14-year-old sitting with her four-year-old sister on her lap, who had lost their home and all their family members in an Israeli raid in 2014.
'I will never forget. The 14-year-old didn't even consider herself a child, she was forced into a caring role because she had no other choice," she said.
Farajallah said that the older sister told her, "When I walk on the street, people always talk about when is the next war coming" and then, pointing to her baby she asked, "How are we going to protect these children?'
"That's the impact of the war on Gaza,' Farajallah said.
What effect do poverty and poor infrastructure have?
"They do not live the typical lives of children," Farajallah said.
Many children in Gaza are unable to attend school regularly because of military actions and they have limited access to essential school supplies, she said.
According to the Geneva-based Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, Gaza struggles with a 47 percent unemployment rate, but the grim future children face isn't as harmful to their motivation to achieve in school as other conditions.
'Education is very important in Palestinian culture, whether there are job prospects or not," Farajallah said. "But with little food, children are malnourished, and with drones buzzing overhead 24 hours a day it's affecting their sleep – they can't concentrate, their childhood is shattered."
What other trauma is caused by war?
A child exposed to war may introduce a traumatic element into playtime and storytelling, Farajallah said.
Farajallah has observed children playing games involving Israeli soldiers and Palestinians and likened it to children in the West playing "Cowboys and Indians".
"Here, they hold sticks and pretend they are guns," she said.
Some, however, display a lack of interest in everyday life, becoming withdrawn, while others present antisocial behaviour. Every child displays trauma in their own way.
"One boy I met, aged nine, he told me that when he hears a bomb he rushes to his home and layers up under the bedcovers. He did this in the hope that he couldn't be seen and so wouldn't be bombed," she said.
Some may display restlessness, regression or violent behaviour.
'Others may not want to leave their mothers' sight, they won't even leave the room to go to the bathroom or kitchen without their mothers, and I'm talking about teenagers here,' Farajallah said.
Dr Mamoun Mobayed, a consultant psychiatrist and director of treatment and rehabilitation at Qatar's Behavioral Healthcare Center, said that wartime conditions haunt children when they sleep.
"Nightmares are frequently experienced, and some experience bed-wetting because of the nightmares," he said.
Do children become immune to these conditions over time?
Mobayed, who has travelled to occupied Palestine since 2002 as a volunteer with the Qatar Red Crescent Society, said that 'people do not become immune to trauma and death".
"They may reach a state of learned helplessness. It's a state of despair where there's a realisation that whatever they do it's ineffective, they cannot escape the situation, they're trapped,' Mobayed said. 'Ironically, this phenomenon was discovered when psychologists were dealing with the Jewish people in Nazi concentration camps."
Farajallah agreed and said that it is difficult to become desensitised to severe conditions that are still ongoing.
'You cannot become immune to not having water or no food on the table. That's the reality now.'
How will this trauma affect their future?
'Trauma affects cognitive behaviour, it affects functioning, how can we totally ignore that? Living in a war zone – for generations will affect you," Farajallah said, adding that violent upbringings will lead to more violence.
"We are not talking about individuals living in peaceful, healthy environments here. When you steal hope from these kids, steal their livelihood and childhood, what do you expect the product to be?"
Mobayed, who has decades of experience working with people affected by war, displacement and trauma, said he's witnessed a pattern of transgenerational trauma.
"Trauma has been passed down, inadvertently, from one generation to the next. They have had no time for cognitive-emotional processing, for self-healing, and so the cycle continues," he said.
"It's alarming because it means, more violence not less will be on the horizon."
Can war-related trauma ever be undone?
'From my own experience – I'd say no," Farajallah said. "But we can work on it to undo some of the harm, develop acceptance, build resilience and move on with life."
Speaking from personal experience, Farajallah said that trauma from war remains with her to this day. It's been 20 years since Farajallah left Gaza and she still can't stand to watch fireworks. The sounds bring her back to living in Gaza when it was under attack.
'The solution isn't found in psychology – the only solution is a peaceful political resolution to solve the issue of Palestine," she said.
"We are human and just like everyone else want to have healthy families and communities where we are free to enjoy life again.'

What is Israel's narrative on the Gaza hospital explosion?

October 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
At least 500 people were killed in an explosion at al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City at around 7.30pm on Tuesday, the deadliest strike since war broke out between Hamas and Israel on October 7.
In the fog of war, reactions have been confused, with denials of responsibility from both Israeli and Palestinian camps against a backdrop of competing online narratives and widespread disinformation.
But many are disinclined to believe Israel's claim that the explosion was caused by a rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group. This scepticism has been fuelled by contradictions between Israel's immediate and later responses.
So how has the narrative shifted since the explosion?
How did Israel react?
Initial posts on X sent by Hananya Naftali, a digital aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, aroused suspicion. "Israeli Air Force struck a Hamas terrorist base inside a hospital in Gaza," he wrote , but the post was almost immediately deleted.
By 10.58pm, Naftali apologised on X for sharing 'a Reuters report' that 'falsely stated Israel struck the hospital'. He said he had since deleted the tweet. 'As the [Israeli army] does not bomb hospitals, I assumed Israel was targeting one of the Hamas bases in Gaza,' he added.
Earlier today I shared a report that was published on @reuters  about the bombing at the hospital in Gaza which falsely stated Israel struck the hospital. I mistakenly shared this information in a since deleted post in which I referenced Hamas' routine use of hospitals to store
- Hananya Naftali (@HananyaNaftali) October 17, 2023
A bit earlier, at 9:04pm, the Israeli army had published a post blaming the strike on a misfired missile launched by PIJ: 'From the analysis of the operational systems of the [Israeli army], an enemy rocket barrage was carried out towards Israel, which passed through the vicinity of the hospital when it was hit,' it said.
Breaking: IDF Spokesperson
From the analysis of the operational systems of the IDF, an enemy rocket barrage was carried out towards Israel, which passed through the vicinity of the hospital when it was hit.
According to intelligence information, from several sources we have,

However, it transpired the post had been edited. An earlier version had included alleged video evidence.
But Aric Toler, a journalist on the visual investigations team at The New York Times, disputed the accuracy of the footage, noting that the time stamp indicated it had been recorded 40 minutes after the time of the explosion.
The first public mentions of the hospital strike were around 7:20pm local time. This livestream shows an explosion at about 8pm local time. https://t.co/YqfOA0iDcz

As a jumbled narrative emerged, sceptics seized on comments by Tal Heinrich, a spokesperson for Netanyahu, who told CNN  on Tuesday night that the '[Israeli army] does not target hospitals", adding, "We only target Hamas strongholds, arms depots and terror targets".
But in a statement  issued on the night of the explosion, the World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that there had actually been over 51 attacks on healthcare facilities in Gaza since the start of the conflict on October 7. Fifteen healthcare workers had been killed and 27 injured.
The Israeli military itself had issued evacuation orders last week from 22 hospitals treating more than 2,000 patients in the Gaza Strip as it intensified its bombing campaign. A senior health official in Gaza told Al Jazeera that Israel had fired two artillery shells as a 'warning' at al-Ahli Arab Hospital days before the explosion.
'Now, even a hospital is not a safe place anymore ' said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the West Bank and Gaza.
What 'evidence' is out there?
The Netanyahu government has denied that the blast could have been the result of an Israeli air strike.
On October 18, Netanyahu reposted evidence collated in a video from the army, showing examples of craters caused by army bombs, including holes of seven and nine metres, and aerial images of the hospital site. There were 'no visible signs of craters or evidence of craters or significant damage to buildings,' said the video.

"The entire world should know: It was barbaric terrorists in Gaza that attacked the hospital in Gaza, and not the [Israeli army]," Netanyahu said in another post.
A widely circulated video of the blast, obtained from an Israeli Telegram account called Intellinews, doubled down on the Israeli army's misfired rocket theory. Israeli analyst David Lisovtsev said: 'This is a surface explosion, almost no soil is thrown up, so it's not an air bomb. Looks like a failed Hamas rocket that landed there, what a tragedy has Hamas brought to the people of Gaza!'

On October 18, Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow for Airpower and Military Technology at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank in London, posted an image of the hospital's burned-out parking lot circulated by an analyst at the US Center for Naval Analyses, with no crater visible. 'Still not conclusive, but IF this is the extent of the damage then I'd say an airstrike looks less likely than a rocket failure causing an explosion and fuel fire,' he said.

The Israeli army also released a video  showing spokesperson Daniel Hagari translating a recording of a conversation between purported Hamas officials, where they appear to talk about the misfired rocket that had caused the hospital blast.
To some, it seemed too neat. As one journalist later asked Hagari: "I'd like you to address the question of credibility, because … the [Israeli army] has a less than perfect track record with the issue of credibility".
In his response, Hagari admitted that the military had lied before, but that now was different.

Why the scepticism?
Many are inclined to disbelieve the Israeli government and army since the death of Al Jazeera journalist  , which saw the Israeli government first deny, then admit to killing her.
Assassinated in May 2022, while reporting on Israeli incursions into the Jenin refugee camp, the veteran Palestinian-American journalist was shot in the head by a soldier.
At the time, Naftali Bennett, then the prime minister of Israel, responded with an online message, accusing Palestinians of her murder. 'According to the information we have gathered, it appears likely that armed Palestinians - who were firing indiscriminately at the time - were responsible for the unfortunate death of the journalist,' he said.
Later, the Israeli military said there was a 'high possibility' that slain Abu Akleh was 'accidentally hit' by Israeli army fire. However, it decided not to pursue a criminal investigation into her death. This month, a report from a UN-mandated investigative body said Israeli forces used 'lethal force without justification' when they shot and killed the journalist, violating her 'right to life'.
Scepticism is also fuelled by the ruthlessness of the Israeli attacks on the besieged population of Gaza. At 7pm on October 17, shortly before the blast, Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's minister of national security, had said on X: 'As long as Hamas does not release the hostages in its hands – the only thing that needs to enter Gaza are hundreds of tons of explosives from the Air Force, not an ounce of humanitarian aid.'
Netanyahu's office had tweeted this just before the Israeli airstrike on a Gaza hospital that killed more than 500 Palestinians. After the news of hospital killing came out, the tweet was quietly deleted. pic.twitter.com/1yhemvmxbE
- Ashok Swain (@ashoswai) October 17, 2023
Shortly after the blast, Netanyahu deleted a message from his X feed that repeated a line from his address  on October 16 to the Knesset. It said: 'This is a struggle between the children of light and the children of darkness, between humanity and the law of the jungle'. The message appeared to echo the tone used earlier by Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who had described Palestinians as 'beastly people'.

Dozens of premature babies evacuated from Gaza to Egypt

A group of 28 premature babies has been evacuated from al-Shifa Hospital in the besieged Gaza Strip and taken to Egypt for urgent treatment as Palestinian officials say Israeli forces have attacked another hospital in northern Gaza.
The newborns had been patients at al-Shifa, Gaza's largest medical facility, where several others had died after their incubators stopped working for a lack of fuel as medical services collapse during the Israeli military's ground and air assault on Gaza City.
The babies were transported on Sunday to al-Helal Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah in southern Gaza, so their condition could be stabilised before making the trip to Egypt through the Rafah border crossing on Monday.
'Three babies still remain at the Emirati hospital and continue to receive treatment,' a World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson told the Reuters news agency.
'All babies are fighting serious infections and continue needing health care.'

Last week, Israeli forces seized al-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical facility in Gaza, to search for what they said was a Hamas tunnel network and command centre built underneath the complex. Hamas has denied the allegations.
During the Israeli operation, hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people left al-Shifa at the weekend and moved to the southern Gaza Strip.
Since al-Shifa doctors have raised the alarm about the situation at the hospital for premature babies and the lack of clean water and medicines in the neonatal ward, eight infants have died, according to hospital officials.
Attack on Indonesian Hospital
At another hospital in northern Gaza, at least 12 people were killed by artillery fire on Monday and dozens wounded, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
The ministry said hundreds of people were trapped at the facility, which was encircled by Israeli tanks.
Reporting from the hospital, journalist Anas al-Sharif described the scenes inside as 'chaotic'.
'There is an overwhelming state of panic among patients,' he told Al Jazeera. 'Victims are piling up on the floor.'
The WHO's chief said the United Nations agency was "appalled" by the attack on the Indonesian Hospital.
"Health workers and civilians should never have to be exposed to such horror, and especially while inside a hospital," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
. @WHO  is appalled by an attack on the Indonesian Hospital in #Gaza , reportedly resulting in 12 deaths, including patients, and tens of injuries, including critical and life-threatening ones.

Indonesia's foreign minister condemned the attack on the hospital, which was built in 2016 and funded by Indonesia, and called it a 'clear violation of international humanitarian laws'.
'All countries, especially those that have close relations with Israel, must use all their influence and capabilities to urge Israel to stop its atrocities,' Retno Marsudi said.
'We are very concerned about the fate of our colleagues and the fate of wounded and patients as well as [displaced] people who may have still [been] sheltering there. No ambulances can reach them, and we're afraid the wounded will die,' said Nahed Abu Taaema, director of Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza.
Like most hospitals and clinics in the northern half of the Gaza Strip, the Indonesian Hospital has largely ceased operations but is sheltering patients, staff and displaced people who have sought shelter at the site after Israel launched its assault on Gaza last month.

As fighting continues between Israeli forces and Hamas in Gaza, US and Israeli officials said a Qatari-mediated deal to free some of the captives held in the Palestinian enclave and pause fighting temporarily to enable aid deliveries to stricken civilians was edging closer.
About 240 hostages were taken during a deadly assault on southern Israel by Hamas on October 7. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, according to Israeli tallies.
After the attack, Israel promised to topple the armed group, which has governed Gaza since 2007, and it launched a devastating bombardment and ground offensive on Gaza.
At least 13,000 Palestinians have been killed, including at least 5,500 children, according to Palestinian officials.

UN experts demand ceasefire, warn Gaza is 'running out of time'

November 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
United Nations experts have called for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, saying time was running out for the Palestinian people who are at "grave risk of genocide".
Nearly four weeks of   in retaliation for attacks by Hamas gunmen in southern Israel on October 7 have killed more than 9,000 people, health authorities say, a majority of them women and children.
"We remain convinced that the Palestinian people are at grave risk of genocide," the group of experts, made up of seven UN special rapporteurs, said on Thursday in a statement. "We demand a humanitarian ceasefire to ensure that aid reaches those who need it the most."
The experts have also expressed 'deepening horror' about Israeli   in northern Gaza since Tuesday night – strikes that have reportedly killed and injured hundreds of Palestinians – and have called this a brazen breach of international law.
They said they were concerned about the safety of UN and humanitarian workers, hospitals and schools that are providing refuge to the people of Gaza, and the safety of journalists, media workers and their family members.
The Israeli mission to the UN in Geneva said it was preparing a response to the experts' remarks.
The International Criminal Court defines the crime of genocide as the specific intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group by killing its members or by other means, including imposing measures intended to prevent births or forcibly transferring children from one group to another.
On October 28, departing senior UN human rights official   wrote to the High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk, saying "We are seeing a genocide unfolding before our eyes, and the Organization that we serve appears powerless to stop it."
The UN rights office said that Mokhiber's planned retirement took effect this week and that his views were "personal" and did not reflect those of the office.
The supply of aid to Gaza has been choked since Israel began bombarding the densely populated enclave, with aid organisations saying it is nowhere near matching the needs of the people there.
"The situation in Gaza has reached a catastrophic tipping point," the UN experts said, adding that Gazans had been left with scarce water, medicine, fuel and essential supplies while facing health hazards.
They also pointed to Israel's allies, which they said "bear responsibility and must act now to prevent its disastrous course of action".
"We call on Israel and its allies to agree to an immediate ceasefire," the UNexperts said. "We are running out of time."

Islamophobia, anti-Semitism rises in EU amid Israel-Hamas war: Official

November 7th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Brussels, Belgium – Hate speech targeting Muslims and Jews in Europe is rising as the conflict between Israel and Hamas rages, a European Union official tasked with combating Islamophobia has warned.
"We've seen a very clear rising trend of anti-Muslim hatred and anti-Semitic narratives. This hate speech ranges from microaggressions to clear threats and we've observed most of it happening on social media platforms," Marion Lalisse told Al Jazeera.
"The hatred towards Muslims in particular, has to do with negative stereotypes considering Muslims as a monolithic group involved in violence. Such biases are spread across EU nations."
Lalisse said research is needed on how Europeans are being educated on Muslims and Islam.
"I grew up in rural France which was very diverse and I was taught about the Muslim religion and culture of the people who follow this faith, in a manner which didn't portray them as threats," she told Al Jazeera.
"So in my role of combating anti-Muslim hatred, we are funding projects related to the remembrance of the past and analysing how history books in schools and universities in Europe portray Muslims."
Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel one month ago; the current Israeli death toll exceeds 1,400.
After October 7, Israel in retaliation launched a massive bombing campaign of Gaza, in what it says is an effort to crush the Palestinian group that rules the strip.
Gaza is one of the world's most densely populated areas. To date, more than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed, many women and children among them.
Anti-Semitic crimes are being recorded in several European countries.
But besides the UK, other European countries have not published statistics on reported Islamophobic incidents, which have also been increasing since October 7, according to Human Rights Watch.
"This suggests they do not record hate crimes against people perceived to be Muslim. Lack of data impedes effective policy responses to such hate crimes," the rights group said in a statement.
The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) has a database documenting anti-Muslim hatred between 2010 and 2020 in the bloc, which according to Lalisse will be updated in the coming weeks.
"We are all in this together," Lalisse said.
"We need to make sure that there is a balanced narrative on what's happening in Europe so that people can live freely, regardless of their religious belief or absence of religious belief."
Asked whether she considers French bans on garments worn by some Muslims discriminatory, Lalisse said: "We've noted how a Muslim woman wearing a hijab in France is likely to face more discrimination than the country's overall Muslim population."
She further defended the French measures, adding: "The ban of the abaya or other religious symbols at school or in some other circumstances is related to the willingness to show neutrality and spread equality. These are France's secular values which are often misunderstood."

Biden pledges military aid, political support for Israel amid Gaza war

October 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - United States President Joe Biden has pledged unwavering support for Israel as its military   with bombardment, in the wake of an unprecedented   from the Palestinian group Hamas over the weekend.
In a White House speech on Tuesday, Biden said that Washington will provide additional military assistance to Israel, which has since declared war on Hamas.
He also underscored the brutality of Saturday's attack — which killed hundreds of people and saw others taken captive — and compared Hamas to ISIL (ISIS), accusing it of "terrorism".
"This is what they mean by human tragedy, an atrocity on an appalling scale," Biden said. "We're going to continue to stand united, supporting the people of Israel who are suffering unspeakable losses and opposing the hatred and violence of terrorism."
The US president, however, did not provide details about the Israeli war in Gaza or its aims — only backing what he called Israel's "duty to respond to these vicious attacks".
Here, Al Jazeera looks at five key takeaways from Biden's address:
Biden pledges more military aid to Israel
Biden pledged more military assistance for Israel, which already receives $3.8bn in US military aid.
"We're surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish the Iron Dome," he said referring to Israel's anti-missile system.
"We're going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens."
. @VP  and I sat down with our teams to receive a situation update on the terrorist attack in Israel and to direct next steps.

- President Biden (@POTUS) October 10, 2023
The US president called on Congress to take "urgent action to fund the national security requirements of our critical partners", likely referring to both  , the latter of which is fending off a full-scale invasion from Russia.
"This is not about party or politics. It's about the security of our world, the security of the United States of America," he said.
Biden added that his administration is in "near constant communication" with Israeli partners.
According to the White House, Biden has been closely following the situation with daily briefings from his security team. Earlier on Tuesday, he spoke to Israeli Prime Minister   for the third time in as many days.
Americans amongst Hamas captives
Biden confirmed that Americans are among the captives held by Hamas without specifying the number. He also said that 14 US citizens have been killed in the attack.
"I'm directing my team to share intelligence and deploy additional experts from across the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage recovery efforts because as president, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world," he said.
No mention of Palestinian civilians or broader conflict
With the   in Gaza as Israeli jets relentlessly bomb the densely populated territory, Biden did not mention Palestinian casualties.
Instead, he focused on Israeli victims of Hamas's attack.
The only time Biden mentioned Palestinians was to slam Hamas. "Hamas doesn't stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination," he said. "Its stated purpose is the annihilation of the state of Israel on the murder of Jewish people."
In its 2017 charter, Hamas rejects the "persecution of any human being or the undermining of his or her rights on nationalist, religious or sectarian grounds".
Biden also did not address the root causes of the conflict.
Hamas leaders have said they launched the attack in response to Israeli violations   in Jerusalem, near daily violence against Palestinians in the West Bank and the nearly 20-year blockade on Gaza.
Leading rights groups have accused Israel of imposing a   on Palestinians.
US warns against 'taking advantage' of war
Biden, apparently addressing Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah, warned other parties in the region against "taking advantage" of the war in Gaza.
"To any country, any organisation, anyone thinking of taking advantage of the situation, I have one word: Don't. Our hearts may be broken but our resolve is clear," he said.
The US president said Washington has "enhanced its military force posture" in the region to "strengthen deterrence".
The Pentagon had announced it is sending additional   to the Eastern Mediterranean after the Hamas attack.
"We stand ready to move in additional assets as needed," Biden said on Tuesday.
The US has not participated directly in the attacks on Gaza, and a White House spokesperson said on Monday that Washington has "no intention to put US boots on the ground".
Unqualified political support for Israeli response
Biden offered unqualified political support to Israel's military response despite fears for the more than 2.2 million people who live in Gaza.
Israeli leaders have   a "complete siege" on the Palestinian enclave, pledging to prevent food and other essential supplies from entering the territory, raising concerns from rights advocates and the United Nations.
"Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond, indeed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks," Biden said on Tuesday.
"Let there be no doubt: The United States has Israel's back. We'll make sure the Jewish and democratic state of Israel can defend itself — today, tomorrow, as we always have. It's as simple as that," he added.
Biden said he told Netanyahu that, if the US had experienced a similar attack, its response would be "swift, decisive and overwhelming".
"We also discussed how democracies like Israel and United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law," Biden said.

Gaza's next big threat: Cholera, infectious diseases amid total blockade

Waseem Mushtaha's four children have been out of school for almost two weeks. Instead of learning mathematics or geography, they are being taught how to ration water.
'Every day I fill a bottle of water for each one and I tell them: Try to manage this,' he told Al Jazeera, speaking from the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. 'At the beginning, they struggled, but now they are coping.'
After Israel issued an   for 1.1 million Palestinians in the northern part of Gaza, Mushtaha drove his wife and children aged eight to 15 to his aunt's home in Khan Younis, where residents opened their doors to extended family and friends amid Israel's  .
As a water and sanitation officer for global non-profit Oxfam, Mushtaha sees the markers of an impending public health catastrophe all around him. 'People sleep on the streets, in shops, in mosques, in their cars or on the streets,' he said. His family lives alongside around 100 people crammed in a 200-square-metre apartment and count themselves among the lucky ones.
Meanwhile, hygiene products have disappeared from the few supermarkets that are   and water sold by private vendors who run small solar-powered desalination facilities has doubled in price since October 7 – when Israel began bombing Gaza in retaliation for the surprise attack carried out by   It used to cost 30 shekels ($7.40), but is now priced at 60 shekels ($15).
On Wednesday, Mushtaha estimated that his family would run out of water in 24 hours. After that, he didn't know what would happen. "We will go to the market and purchase whatever is available,' he explained. 'We are looking to the future with bleak eyes.'

Collapse of water and sanitation services
Oxfam and United Nations agencies have warned that the   will spark bouts of cholera and other deadly infectious diseases if urgent humanitarian aid is not delivered.
Israel cut off its water pipeline to Gaza, along with the fuel and electricity provisions that power water and sewage plants, after announcing a total blockade of the Palestinian enclave following the  .
Most of Gaza's 65 sewage pumping stations and all five of its wastewater treatment facilities have been forced to stop operations. According to Oxfam, untreated sewage is now being released into the sea while solid waste is also ending up on some streets alongside bodies waiting to be buried.
Desalination plants have stopped working and municipalities are unable to pump water to residential areas because of the power shortage. Some people in Gaza are relying on salty tap water from the enclave's only aquifer, which is contaminated with sewage and seawater, or have resorted to drinking seawater. Others are being forced to drink from farm wells.

'On the streets with no protection'
The UN says that currently in Gaza only three litres of water a day is available per person to cover all their needs including drinking, washing, cooking and flushing the toilet. Between 50-100 litres of water each day is the recommended amount for a person to meet their basic health requirements, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
An employee of the charity Islamic Relief who also found shelter in Khan Younis described a similar situation. 'At my parents' house, there are around 20 children and seven adults sheltering. Even with so many people we only flush the toilet twice a day - once in the morning, once at night - to save water,' she said, requesting anonymity.
'We cook food that uses the least water. We wash for prayers just once or twice," she added. "We have a neighbour with a well, but he doesn't have any electricity to pump the water. They've got a generator but no fuel.'
For those who have no shelter, conditions are most dire. "There are families with children and newborn babies living without a roof over their heads," she said. "They just sit on the streets without protection, water, food or anything. They don't have any security."
'We are ready to go'
Fears are growing that dehydration and waterborne diseases will lead to a humanitarian catastrophe amid Israeli air strikes that have killed  .
Humanitarian organisations have repeatedly issued calls for the aid stocked at the  , the sole route for aid to enter the Gaza Strip on the only border that it shares with Egypt, to be let through.
Following a visit to Israel on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said an   had been reached with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow deliveries of assistance in the coming days. Israel has insisted that all trucks must be checked and that no aid must reach Hamas fighters. Biden also said Egypt had agreed to allow an initial convoy of   with aid through the Rafah border crossing into Gaza.

Mathew Truscott, Head of Humanitarian Policy at Oxfam, said he felt frustration at the idea that diseases could be spreading while water and medicines piled up a few kilometres across the border.

Four out of 34 hospitalsare no longer operational, according to the UN health agency, as others overflow with injured patients and families in need of shelter.

For any efforts to turn the tide, 'getting aid in is vital', the WHO representative added. 'The ball is in the court of the political leaders who have to elevate humanitarian needs as a priority. We are ready to go, but we have to be given unhindered, secure, protected passage to help people in need.'

Israel 'not successful' in minimising Gaza civilian casualties: Netanyahu

The Israeli military is doing all it can to get civilians out of harm's way amid its war in Gaza, but its attempts to minimise casualties are "not successful," said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The Israeli leader's comments came after he was asked by US television channel CBS News on Thursday whether the killing of thousands of Palestinians in retaliation for the October 7 attack by Hamas would fuel hatred in a new generation.
"Any civilian death is a tragedy. And we shouldn't have any because we're doing everything we can to get the civilians out of harm's way, while Hamas is doing everything to keep them in harm's way," Netanyahu said.
"So, we send leaflets, [we] call them on their cell phones, and we say: 'leave'. And many have left," Netanyahu said.
The same day, Israel's air force dropped leaflets in parts of south Gaza telling people to evacuate for their own safety.
It was not clear where they were supposed to evacuate to as Israel continues to wage war across the besieged territory.
Weeks earlier, Israel also used leaflet drops in northern Gaza to warn civilians to move to the south.
Hundreds of thousands have done so, in a mass displacement that many Palestinians fear could become permanent.
Israel has said the goal of its military campaign is to destroy Hamas.
"The other thing that I can say is that we'll try to finish that job with minimal civilian casualties. That's what we're trying to do: minimal civilian casualties. But unfortunately, we're not successful," the Israeli prime minister said.
Netanyahu then said he wanted to draw a parallel with something related to Germany, but he was interrupted by the CBS interviewer, who asked him a question about Gaza's post-war security.
Palestinian civilians have borne the brunt of Israel's weeks-long military campaign, which has come in response to the attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
Hamas also took about 240 people of different nationalities as captives, according to Israel.
On Friday, the Israeli military said it had retrieved the body of one of the captives, a female soldier, from a building near Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital which has become the main focus of the Israeli assault this week.
The soldier's death was confirmed on Tuesday after Hamas issued a video of her alive, followed by images of what the group said was her body after she was killed in an Israeli air strike.
The Israeli military claimed to have found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas at al-Shifa Hospital. A video, which could not immediately be verified, showed a deep hole in the ground, surrounded by rubble, wood, and sand.
It appeared the area had been excavated; a bulldozer appeared in the background.
The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons.
Hamas said in a statement on Thursday evening that claims by the Pentagon and US State Department that the group uses al-Shifa for military purposes "is a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman".
The United States is confident in an assessment from its own intelligence agencies on Hamas activities in al-Shifa Hospital and will neither share nor elaborate on it, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Thursday.
Protected by law
Human Rights Watch said hospitals have special protections under international humanitarian law.
"Hospitals only lose those protections if it can be shown that harmful acts have been carried out from the premises," the watchdog's UN Director Louis Charbonneau said.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, on his first visit to Israel since the October 7 Hamas attack, called on Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza.
"I understand your rage but let me ask you not to be consumed by rage," Borrell said.
Gaza health authorities deemed reliable by the United Nations say at least 11,500 people have been confirmed killed in an Israeli bombardment and ground invasion – more than 4,700 of them children.
Two-thirds of the Gaza Strip's population of 2.3 million has been made homeless by the war.

Saudi Crown Prince MBS says Israel normalisation getting 'closer'

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) has said that his country was moving steadily closer to normalising relations with Israel, following  , and amid a big push by the United States for a Saudi-Israeli deal.
"Every day, we get closer," the crown prince told US broadcaster Fox News, according to excerpts seen by Reuters of an interview scheduled to air later on Wednesday.
The interview with the crown prince, widely known as MBS, came as US President Joe Biden's administration presses ahead with an effort to broker historic ties between the two regional powerhouses, Washington's top Middle East allies.
The normalisation talks are the   that also include possible Israeli concessions to the Palestinians, as well as discussions of US security guarantees and civilian nuclear help that Riyadh has sought.
MBS told Fox's, Special Report, that the Palestinian issue was "very important" to Riyadh. 'We need to solve that part,' he said when asked what it would take to get a normalisation agreement.
'We got to see where we go. We hope that will reach a place, that it will ease the life of the Palestinians, get Israel as a player in the Middle East,' he said, speaking in English.
US officials have privately touted the potential benefits of a regional mega-deal, which would be a foreign policy win as   in November 2024.
MBS also said that if Iran got obtained a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia would "have to get one".
Saudi Arabia, along with Israel, has long been an adversary of Iran, but relations have improved since Riyadh and Tehran agreed to restore diplomatic relations in March.
Tehran has denied seeking a nuclear weapon, but has been at the centre of international suspicions about its nuclear programme for years.
The broadcast of the crown prince's comments will follow a   between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, in which they pledged to work together towards Israeli-Saudi normalisation, which could reshape the geopolitics of the Middle East.
Both leaders also said Iran could not be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.
The interview with Fox's anchor, Bret Baier, was the royal's first on US TV since 2019. Saudi Arabia has been embroiled in controversy, particularly following the crown prince's alleged role in the killing of Washington Post journalist   in 2018.
After a week of lead-up interviews with various Saudi government and business leaders, Baier told Fox that he had seen the country undergo "tectonic changes at a scale and pace and degree that no country in modern times has seen'.
"These changes have been positive," he added.

Netanyahu says no ceasefire until captives freed, open to 'little pauses'

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again ruled out a ceasefire until Hamas releases its captives in Gaza, but signalled his openness to "tactical little pauses' to allow the movement of people and aid.
'There'll be no ceasefire, general ceasefire, in Gaza without the release of our hostages. As far as tactical little pauses, an hour here, an hour there – we've had them before,' Netanyahu said in an interview with ABC News on Monday.
'I suppose we'll check the circumstances in order to enable goods, humanitarian goods to come in, or our hostages, individual hostages to leave. But I don't think there's going to be a general ceasefire."
Netanyahu's comments come as Israel faces growing international pressure to halt its bombardment of Gaza, which was launched in response to Hamas's October 7 attacks that Israeli officials say killed at least 1,405 people, mostly civilians.
On Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an urgent ceasefire, warning that the enclave had become a "  ".
The United States, Israel's closest ally, has pressed Netanyahu to agree to "humanitarian pauses" to allow aid into the enclave, but backed the Israeli leader's opposition to a full ceasefire.
On Monday, Israel's military said it had 'coordinated' with Jordan to airdrop urgent medical supplies and food to a Jordanian field hospital in the enclave.
At least 10,022 Palestinians, including more than 4,100 children, have been killed in Gaza during the month-long war, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.
On Monday, Netanyahu said the loss of any civilian life was a "tragedy" but disputed the reported death toll, saying it included "several thousand" Palestinian fighters, and accused Hamas of using Gaza's population as human shields.
"It's a very tough enemy but we can't let them have immunity," he said.
Netanyahu also suggested that Israel would manage Gaza's security long after the war.
"I think Israel will for an indefinite period … have the overall security responsibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have that security responsibility," Netanyahu said.
"When we don't have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine."

Iran warns of 'preemptive' action against Israel amid Gaza war

Iran has warned of a possible "preemptive" action against Israel "in the coming hours", as Israel prepares for a ground offensive on the Gaza Strip.
The Iran-backed, Lebanese group Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire across the Lebanese-Israeli frontier for days, further raising tensions as Israel bombards the Gaza Strip to the south following an unprecedented attack by the Palestinian armed group Hamas inside Israel last week.
'All possible options and scenarios are there for Hezbollah … Naturally, resistance leaders will not allow the Zionist regime to take any action in Gaza, and when it feels reassured about Gaza, move on to other resistance areas in the region," Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said in a live broadcast to state TV late on Monday, as he referred to his meeting with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah the previous day.
"Therefore, any preemptive measure is imaginable in the coming hours."
Amirabdollahian also said "the resistance leaders" will not allow Israel "to do whatever it wants in Gaza".
"If we don't defend Gaza today, tomorrow we have to defend against these [phosphorus] bombs in the children's hospital of our own country," he added, referring to allegations by human rights groups that Israel has been using phosphorus bombs in its aerial bombardment of Gaza. Israel has denied the allegation.
Reporting from southern Lebanon, Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr said Amirabdollahian was seen "as the strongest yet".
"Hezbollah has been engaged with Israel along the border for more than a week now. But that cross-border exchange of fire has been largely limited in scope and confined to the border areas and military targets," she said, adding, however, that tensions were rising.
"People are worrying and bracing for the possibility of this conflict, which is now confined to the south of the country, to spread elsewhere."
Speaking to Al Jazeera on Sunday, Amirabdollahian   Israel of regional escalation if its forces entered Gaza for a ground offensive.
'If the measures aimed at immediately stopping the Israeli attacks that are killing children in the Gaza Strip end in a deadlock, it is highly probable that many other fronts will be opened. This option is not ruled out and this is becoming increasingly more probable,' Amir-Abdollahian said.
Israel declared war on Hamas, the group running the Gaza Strip, after waves of its fighters broke through Gaza's heavily militarised border with Israel on October 7 and killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel has responded by pummelling the Gaza Strip with non-stop air and artillery attacks that have flattened neighbourhoods and killed at least 2,750 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to Palestinian officials.
Iran celebrated the Hamas assault but insisted it was not involved.
Monday's remarks come as Israel prepares for a ground invasion into the Gaza Strip, where fears for Palestinians trapped in the heavily bombarded enclave have grown since Israel launched its aerial campaign.

Netanyahu apologises for blaming Israeli security chiefs for Hamas attack

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has apologised for a post in which he cast blame on the country's security services for failing to anticipate Hamas's October 7 attack, saying he was 'wrong' to make such comments at a time when unity is paramount.
In a social media post late on Saturday, Netanyahu took a dig at his own intelligence services, saying they had failed to warn him of a looming Hamas assault and instead assured him the group was 'deterred'.
'At no time and no stage was a warning given to Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding war intentions of Hamas,' Netanyahu wrote in the now-deleted post on X, formerly Twitter. 'On the contrary, all security officials, including the head of army intelligence and the head of the Shin Bet, estimated that Hamas was deterred and interested in an arrangement.'
'Leadership most show responsibility'
The remarks quickly drew strong rebukes from fellow Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu's allies, who said it was the time for unity rather than finger-pointing.
'When we are at war, leadership must show responsibility, decide to do the right things and strengthen the forces,' said Benny Gantz, a former defence minister who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet after the attack.
'Any other action or statement harms the people's ability to stand and their strength. The prime minister must retract his statement.'
Yair Lapid, an opposition leader and former prime minister, accused Netanyahu of crossing 'a red line' and undermining the army.
Netanyahu quickly deleted the contentious post and apologised for undercutting his security services in a follow-up statement, guaranteeing that they have his 'full backing'.
'Things I said … should not have been said and I apologize for that,' Netanyahu wrote on X. "I give full backing to all the heads of the security branches … Together we will win.'
טעיתי. דברים שאמרתי בעקבות מסיבת העיתונאים לא היו צריכים להיאמר ואני מתנצל על כך. אני נותן גיבוי מלא לכל ראשי זרועות הביטחון. אני מחזק את הרמטכ״ל ואת מפקדי וחיילי צה״ל שנמצאים בחזית ונלחמים על הבית. יחד ננצח.
- Benjamin Netanyahu – בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) October 29, 2023
While Israel's military and intelligence chiefs have owned up to their shortcomings leading up to the attack, Netanyahu has dodged responsibility, creating a growing rift between him and the departments.
Netanyahu has said that there will be time to ask tough questions, including of himself, after the war.
Netanyahu's response has added to public concerns that he is prioritising his political interests over national security, as he battles a draw-out   trial that could threaten his power.
"[Netanyahu] is not interested in security, he is not interested in hostages, only politics," said opposition lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman, once Netanyahu's defence minister, in a radio interview.
Al Jazeera correspondent Sara Khairat said Netanyahu's public 'war of words' with his cabinet comes as he takes more heat for not owning up to the government's failures.
'Interestingly, [Netanyahu] apologised for the tweets … but has not yet, despite criticism, apologised himself or taken any of the blame for not being able to prevent the attack, at a time when the unity government is supposed to be united,' Khairat said from the occupied West Bank.
'Second phase' of war
Netanyahu's public clash with his intelligence units comes as Israel begins what he has characterised as a "second phase" of its war in the Gaza Strip, with additional   adding to relentless aerial bombardments.
"We are only at the start," Netanyahu said at a press conference. "We will destroy the enemy above ground and below ground."
Israel has been hammering Gaza for three weeks in response to a surprise Hamas onslaught on Israeli territory that killed 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians. Israel's aerial strikes have   8,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians and many children, and decimated much of the enclave's infrastructure.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres renewed calls on Sunday for a "humanitarian pause" to the war, saying the situation in Gaza was growing "more desperate by the hour".
On Sunday, thousands of Palestinians   and basic needs in a sign of desperation. Israel has said that it would allow more aid trucks to enter the Palestinian enclave.

What can Biden's Israel visit accomplish after Gaza hospital bombing?

Hours after an Israeli air raid struck Gaza City's Al-Ahli Arab Hospital on Wednesday morning,   according to health authorities, United States President  .
The hospital was housing thousands of patients and other civilians seeking shelter from the non-stop bombardment of the Gaza Strip by Israel since the October 7 attack by the Palestinian armed group Hamas on southern Israel.
Biden's trip to Washington's closest ally in the Middle East was planned before Tuesday's   and is a high-stakes visit as Israel continues to pummel Gaza in advance of an impending ground offensive.
But Israel's attack on the hospital has already had diplomatic consequences for Biden. Jordan, which was also supposed to host Biden for a summit with the country's King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, has  . Biden is no longer welcome in Amman at the moment.
So, what can he achieve in Israel?
What's the backdrop to Biden's Israel visit?
By Tuesday, more than 3,000 Palestinians, a third of them children, had died from Israeli bombing since October 7 - and that was before the attack on Al-Ahdi Arab Hospital.
Biden's trip comes after his top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, met Arab leaders last week, most of whom refused to condemn Hamas for its attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel, including some foreigners.
Biden is expected to land Tel Aviv at 10am local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, where he will meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials.
According to the US leader, he will receive a comprehensive brief on Israel's war aims and strategy and reaffirm Washington's commitment to Israel's security.
But whether Biden speaks about the attack on Al-Ahdi Hospital publicly, and what he says, will be closely watched for signs of whether the US is recalibrating its stance on the conflict amid growing international outrage over Israel's devastating bombing campaign on Gaza.
Blinken first announced Biden's visit at the end of more than seven hours of talks with Netanyahu and other officials on Monday night, during which he said the Israeli prime minister agreed to come up with a plan to get humanitarian aid to Gaza civilians.
Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza, trapping its 2.3 million people in the besieged enclave without water, food, fuel and electricity.
Can Biden help with humanitarian aid?
Blinken said the plan is to 'enable humanitarian assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not benefit Hamas', which launched one of the deadliest attacks on Israel in decades.
Yet, while it is unclear what impact Israel's air strikes have had on Hamas, the bombing has obliterated block after block of residential buildings in the besieged enclave. Schools and hospitals have not been spared either, adding to Gaza's humanitarian crisis.
Even as Blinken talked about an agreement on humanitarian relief, he did not announce any concrete details and there is no sign that any safe corridors could be set up soon.
On Sunday, he declared that   - the only path out of Gaza not controlled by Israel - would soon be opened to foreign nationals.
However, the crossing remains closed, including for dozens of trucks filled with humanitarian aid from several countries that have been amassed at the border with Egypt.
Instead, Israel has bombed the crossing four times since then.
Whether Biden can help advance plans to get humanitarian assistance to the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza could determine how his visit is viewed outside Israel.
What does it mean for the war?
Biden and other officials in his administration have repeatedly emphasised Israel's right to 'defend' itself and have supported its stated goal of destroying the Palestinian armed group Hamas.
Biden has so far not explicitly called on Israel to show restraint or to stop bombing civilians, ambulances and first responders, or to allow civilians to regain access to food and water, though he has cautioned Israel against going in for an occupation of Gaza.
Israel's top military spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters on Tuesday that Israel has 'all kinds of end games' and Gaza's future will be a 'global issue'.
But Israel appears   into the enclave soon. Many analysts believe that might be delayed at least until Biden leaves Israel to avoid embarrassing the US president.
However, there are signs that Biden's trip could be aimed at developing a common understanding between the US and Israel on how to pursue the war in Gaza.
US Central Command chief General Michael 'Erik' Kurilla arrived in Tel Aviv on Tuesday and is expected to meet top Israeli military officials.
What about Iran's warnings?
Iran has warned for days that new fronts could be opened in the war and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian explicitly said on Monday night that   'in the coming hours' if it continues on its current path.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that Gaza's bombing needs to stop immediately and that Washington ought to be held accountable for the current situation.
Our numerous intelligence reports show that the US is formulating the Zionist regime's current policy, and what is being done is governed by US policymaking. The US must be held responsible for this situation.
- Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) October 17, 2023
It is unclear if and when - or exactly how - Tehran will get in on the action, but Israel and the US have shown they are wary.
Israel has already bombed airports in Syria several times to address concerns Iran may make a move from there, and Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah have already been  , though that fight has yet to escalate further.
Meanwhile, Washington has moved a second carrier and air assets to the region in what has been seen as a warning to Iran as well as the armed groups and campaigns it supports across the region.

Jordan recalls ambassador to Israel to protest Gaza 'catastrophe'

Jordan has announced it is 'immediately' recalling its ambassador to Israel in response to the war in Gaza, accusing Israel of creating an 'unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe'.
"Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi decided to immediately recall Jordan's ambassador to Israel," Jordan's foreign ministry said in a statement, to reflect Amman's condemnation of the "Israeli war that is killing innocent people in Gaza".
The ministry said its envoy would only return if Israel ceased its war on the besieged territory. It also told Israel to recall its ambassador to the kingdom amid the crisis.
The move "is pretty significant diplomatically", said Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher from East Jerusalem, but "it's not going to change what's happening with the Israelis on the ground in Gaza."
Testing Israel-Jordan relations
Jordan, which neighbours Israel to the east, has held a fragile peace agreement with Tel Aviv since 1994, which returned some 380 kilometres (236 miles) of Jordan's occupied land from Israeli control and resolved longstanding water disputes.
The last time Jordan recalled its envoy to Israel was in 2019 to   against the months-long detention of two of its citizens without charges.
However, Israel's 26-day war in Gaza, which Palestinian officials say has killed more than 8,700 people – including more than 3,000 children, has triggered a severe regional backlash, especially in Jordan, where some three million Palestinians live .
On Friday, as Israel continued its air assault on Gaza and sent ground troops into the enclave, Jordan's Safadi warned of a 'humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions' and likely regional spillover.
'Israel's war on Gaza, with brutality of ground attack playing live on TV screens, is pushing region into the abyss,' Safadi wrote on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. 'Int'l community must unequivocally stand against it.'
Israel's war on Gaza, with brutality of ground attack playing live on TV screens, is pushing region into the abyss. Int'l community must unequivocally stand against it. Supporting #UNGA  Arab Res is a must expression of world refusal this catastrophe. Consequences will haunt all
- Ayman Safadi (@AymanHsafadi) October 27, 2023
 
Jordan's King Abdullah has also spoken out against Israel's attacks on and blockade of the crowded Palestinian enclave, saying on October 19 in a joint statement with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi that they rejected  Israel's 'policy of collective punishment'.
Jordan's Queen Rania echoed these sentiments in an interview  with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on October 24. 'This is the first time in modern history that there is such human suffering and the world is not even calling for a ceasefire,' she said.
Amman has seen numerous mass rallies urging for an end to its 29-year peace treaty with Israel and for Jordan to shutter the Israeli embassy following the Gaza war.
Frustration towards Israel had been building among Jordanians earlier this year, due to inflammatory comments by Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
In a speech  in Paris in March, Smotrich said, "There is no such thing as a Palestinian people.'
Jordan's parliament responded at the time by recommending the expulsion of Israel's ambassador to Amman from the country, but that vote was not binding and the government never carried out the expulsion.

Israeli captive endured 'hell' in attack, but treated 'well' in Gaza

An 85-year-old Israeli woman who was taken captive by Hamas for two weeks said she was beaten while being abducted, but treated 'well' while in the Gaza Strip.
Yocheved Lifshitz was   on Monday night along with another elderly woman, 79-year-old Nurit Cooper. Hamas released them on 'humanitarian' grounds in a deal brokered by Qatar and Egypt.
The women are the third and fourth captives released by Hamas since its October 7  some 218 people, including foreigners and dual nationals, are still in captivity in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
'They seemed ready for this'
Lifshitz, sitting in a wheelchair outside a Tel Aviv hospital on Tuesday, recounted being assaulted by her captors as they sped her into Gaza on the back of a motorbike on October 7.
"When I was on the bike, my head was on one side and the rest of my body on the other side," she said. "The young men hit me on the way. They didn't break my ribs but it was painful and I had difficulty breathing."
"I've been through hell … we didn't think or know we would get to this situation.'
Once in Gaza, however, she said her captors 'treated her well", giving her and other captives 'the same food they ate' and bringing in a doctor to provide medicine.
"They treated us gently, and provided all our needs," she said, when questioned about her reason for shaking the hand of one of her captors at the moment of her release.
'They seemed ready for this, they prepared for a long time, they had everything that men and women needed, including shampoo," she added.
Lifshitz, who lives in the Nir Oz kibbutz near the Gaza Strip, said Israel's military had underestimated the threat posed by Hamas, and that the costly security fence "didn't help at all".
Will hostages take priority?
On October 7, armed men from Hamas mowed down parts of the security fence separating Gaza from southern Israel,   more than 1,400 people and seizing more than 220 captives.
Israel has   with a relentless bombing campaign on Gaza, devastating much of the territory's infrastructure and killing more than 5,700 people, mostly civilians. According to the Palestinian health ministry, at least 704 people were killed by Israeli air strikes on the Strip in the past day alone. Israel has also cut off Gaza's fuel, electricity and water.
As Israel readies for a potentially bloody ground assault into the strip, it has ordered more than 1.1 million Palestinians to evacuate the northern part of the territory, warning they may be treated  as 'terror accomplices' if they do not do so.
Israel has said its top goal in the war is to 'obliterate Hamas', but world leaders and Israeli families have urged for the captives to take priority.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who   Israel on Tuesday, said securing the release of the captives which includes French nationals should be the "first objective".
US President Joe Biden, who is eager to bring home 10 Americans thought to be held in the Gaza Strip, said on Monday he would be open to negotiations for a ceasefire only once all captives are released.
Noam Alon, the boyfriend of a 27-year-old woman abducted by Hamas, is one of many Israelis hoping  the Israeli government will focus on the captives' plight. Freeing them 'should be the top priority, not to destroy Hamas, not to control Gaza and not anything else", he said.

Analysis: Israel's Gaza invasion could test its occupation of the West Bank

October 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel maintains a hefty security presence in the occupied West Bank with a network of permanent and temporary checkpoints set up by the army and paramilitary border police.
Military authorities do not reveal the number of checkpoints or their locations, and new, ad hoc posts often pop up overnight with no advance notice.
Those checkpoints and the personnel needed to man them are reminders of how Israel's military is spread out to maintain its occupation. There are also warning signs of the challenge Israel might face in supporting a likely increase in demand for these barriers from Israeli settlers while also needing its troops for an expected invasion of the Gaza Strip.
International agencies try to keep track of the checkpoints, which are a major obstacle to normal and dignified life in the Palestinian territory.
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) counted 645 obstacles before the latest violence. Human Rights Watch counted 1,500 temporary checkpoints that came and went in 2019 and 2020.
The human rights group also warned that, even in a period of relative calm: 'Israeli forces routinely turn away or delay and humiliate Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation, while permitting largely unfettered movement to Israeli settlers.'
Most of the checkpoints are along the separation barrier – a wall that in places rises three storeys high, topped with razor wire and dotted with observation towers and all sorts of surveillance and security equipment.
It snakes through Palestinian lands for more than 700km (435 miles), preventing access to Israel from the occupied West Bank.
Any additional barriers will make daily life and movement more difficult, complicated and miserable for most of the three million inhabitants of the West Bank.
Hit and burn
Many observers believe the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on Saturday were triggered by   instigated and   in the occupied West Bank. There have been numerous cases of hit and burn attacks against Palestinians and their properties near new illegal settlements without any attempt by the Israeli army to prevent the settler rampages.
It is unclear whether the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has turned a blind eye to the rise of settler aggression or tacitly encouraged it.
Most Palestinian residents report two faces of violence: institutionalised but contained harassment by the military and unconcealed hatred and belligerence by settlers who, unlike other citizens of Israel, can legally and openly carry automatic weapons.
Israeli authorities know that potential Palestinian attacks in the occupied territory could target settlers in isolated settlements. In quiet times, many settlements do not have army units but rely on minor garrisons that are responsible for an area with several settlements.
Protecting settlers
Bloody scenes of Israeli villages being overrun by Hamas gunmen and people mowed down by machine guns in their homes or captured have created a new reality on the ground. Settlers now insist on direct and close protection, and the authorities cannot deny it.
Control posts are manpower-intensive. From my own experience during the second Intifada from 2000 to 2005, the Israeli army puts a squad of at least 10 to 20 soldiers on even the smallest 'flying checkpoint'.
In addition to troopers checking passengers and vehicles, a flying checkpoint needs more soldiers to observe incoming and outgoing traffic and provide wider reconnaissance of the surroundings. For an armed response, at least two teams manning vehicle-based weapons for perimeter security and a quick reaction infantry team are needed.
Two shifts can man such a checkpoint around the clock when needed, but after a week or two of long hours, fatigue sets in, causing complacency and loss of vigilance. Every sensible commander will demand a third shift as soon as enough reserves are available.
Thus, to maintain the simplest checkpoint, Israel needs at least 50 men and women. Bigger ones, like crossings in the separation wall, need hundreds. It can be assumed that during this conflict, the Israeli army will eventually deploy up to 50,000 soldiers, a third of its peacetime strength, just to man roadblocks and control stations, some of which will be erected inside Israel too.
Security and political aspects of the settlements also cause a major drain on human resources. The occupied West Bank has about 150 illegal settlement and about 100 outposts not recognised by the Israeli government.
It is hard to imagine that, facing the fury of settlers, the government would settle for anything short of putting at least a platoon of 20 to 40 soldiers in the small settlements and at least a company of 200 soldiers for the bigger or more difficult to defend settlements.
Adding up settlement by settlement, the manpower estimate gets to 30,000 to 50,000 just for that.
Assuming that the Israeli land   is most likely to be launched at the beginning of a weekend, for reasons that are political rather than purely military, the big question is: Can Israel finalise the deployment of all its forces, a prerequisite for action, by the end of Friday?
Risking my reputation, I guess probably not.

The Qatar-brokered, Iran-US prisoner swap | Moroccan girls at risk of being exploited post-quake | Libyan journalists coordinating help on the ground. Here's the Middle East this week:
Spies vs hostages
One man's spies are another man's hostages - is that how the saying goes? In the case of Tehran and Washington, that seems true.
The two countries completed a long-awaited   and in Iran  : 'America Kneels Before Iran' read one newspaper headline.
Prisoner swap or not, it's certainly   between the pair anytime soon.
Moroccan girls targeted
Women who wear tight clothes, spend too much, and don't raise their children right - some Moroccan men say they'd rather marry an underage girl from quake-stricken villages than marry these so-called 'city girls'.
As if Moroccan women and girls are not already reeling from this month's powerful earthquake, now there's a surge of online chatter urging   female children orphaned by the quake.
It doesn't end there. Concerns are also rife about sexual assault, trafficking, menstrual hygiene, and securing safe childbirth.
Libyan journalists on the front line
Stressed and worried about family and friends, Zainab Jibril suffered a miscarriage after the  , but that didn't stop her from reporting on the disaster alongside her husband, fellow journalist, Mohammed Elgrj.
In the midst of tragedy, they're a power couple of sorts among   reporting from the ground despite the   of physical access and censorship by Libya's eastern administration.
Dissidents of a dress code
'  ': The response to the Iranian people's call to end the mandatory hijab law seems to have been a doubling down.
A year ago, the death of   in the custody of Iran's morality police led to months of protests, in Iran and globally.
It seems the protesters' demands only ushered in a more restrictive era.
Now, smart cameras scan for violators, the morality police have been redeployed, and a shiny new hijab law is expected  .
And now, something different
UNESCO has named Jericho's Tell es-Sultan in the occupied West Bank a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine. Note the location.
It's a decision that '  ', according to Palestinian officials.
Predictably, Israeli officials decried it as a '  '.

US attacks facilities in Syria linked to Iran, Pentagon says

October 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United States has attacked two facilities in Syria used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iran-backed groups, the Pentagon has said, following a series of attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria.
The strikes came after President Joe Biden's administration pledged to respond to attacks on US personnel that Washington has blamed on armed groups backed by Iran.
"These precision self-defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17," US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Thursday.
White House National Security Council spokesman had earlier warned that Washington would respond to the attacks at a 'time of our choosing and a manner of our choosing."
Kirby's comments came as the US Department of Defense said on Thursday that US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 16 times this month by "Iranian-backed militia groups".
Reported attacks on US forces in the region have spiked since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, which began earlier this month when the Palestinian group launched an unprecedented attack on Israel that Israeli officials say killed more than 1,400 people.
Palestinian authorities say more than 7,000 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza carried out in response to Hamas's October 7 attacks.
On Wednesday, Biden said he had directly warned Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei against targeting US troops in the Middle East.
"My warning to the ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops, we will respond, and he should be prepared,' Biden told reporters, adding it has "nothing to do" with Israel.
Washington and Tehran do not have formal diplomatic relations, and Biden did not say how the message was communicated.
Mohammad Jamshidi, an aide to Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi, disputed Biden's account in a comment posted on social media.
"The US messages were neither directed to the leader of the Islamic Revolution nor were they anything but requests from the Iranian side,' he said.
'If Biden thinks he has warned Iran, he should ask his team to show him the text of the messages."
US officials are concerned about the possibility of fighting between Israel and Hamas escalating into a broader regional conflict.
Iran backs both Hamas, which governs Gaza, and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, which Israel has clashed with in skirmishes along the Israel-Lebanon border.
On Thursday, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said at the United Nations that the US would "not be spared from this fire" if Israel's bombardment of Gaza did not end.
"I say frankly to the American statesmen, who are now managing the genocide in Palestine, that we do not welcome [an] expansion of the war in the region,' Amir-Abdollahian said. 'But if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire.'

Bahrain recalls ambassador from Israel amid escalating assault on Gaza

November 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Bahrain has confirmed that it recalled its ambassador from Israel, whose escalating war in Gaza has posed a challenge for regional governments that have   ties with Israel.
Following an earlier statement from Bahrain's lower house of parliament, the government confirmed on Thursday that its ambassador was returning and that Israel's ambassador in Manama had left 'a while ago'.
The consultative parliamentary body – which has no powers in the area of foreign policy – said earlier in the day that economic relations with Israel had also been severed. But Israel said that ties with Bahrain were 'stable'.
The statement from the government in Manama made no mention of cutting economic relations, although it did say that flights between the two countries were temporarily suspended.
The decision follows weeks of protests across the Middle East, where Israel's bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip has put warming relations with countries like Bahrain under pressure. Jordan also   to Israel earlier this week.
Over the last several years, states such as Bahrain, Sudan, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates have moved to   and increase economic and military cooperation with Israel.
Those agreements, known as the  , have been strongly promoted by the United States, which has framed them as steps towards a more peaceful Middle East.
Critics say they allow Israel to benefit from greater cooperation without addressing its decades-long occupation of the Palestinian territories and ignore public opinion by forging agreements with autocratic governments.
Following Morocco's  , the US recognised its autonomy over long-disputed territory in  .
Washington also   from its list of state sponsors of "terrorism" after the normalisation of ties, offering a lifeline to the country's military government at a time when it was cracking down on pro-democracy demonstrations and fighting runaway inflation.
The contrast between public opinion and the desire of governments to benefit from greater ties with Israel has become more stark over the last several weeks, as protesters   across the Middle East in solidarity with the Palestinians.
In Bahrain, where protests are rarely tolerated, demonstrators marched to the Israeli embassy and activists called for a reversal of the normalisation agreement.
The war in Gaza has also   towards a possible normalisation deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia.
'I think this dynamic of normalisation will likely slow down or come to a halt,' Steven Cook, a senior fellow for Middle East and Africa Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Associated Press last month.

Will Israel actually allow much-needed aid into Gaza?

Regional efforts are under way for the passage of much-needed humanitarian aid into Gaza via the Rafah crossing, with the United States expected to hold talks with Israel, which blocked the crossing linking Gaza to Egypt in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack.
Hundreds of tonnes of necessary supplies from several countries and NGOs have lined up in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula just south of Gaza as the besieged enclave reels from non-stop Israeli air strikes.
The enclave of 2.3 million people suffers from shortages of food, water, and fuel, as well as critical medical care for residents wounded in the indiscriminate bombardment for the last 11 days.
Here's what we know about the current situation at the only possible passage:
How can aid enter Gaza?
Aid can enter through the   – the only passage from Gaza that is not controlled by Israel and a vital link between Gaza and the rest of the world. But due to the total blockade of the enclave imposed by Israel, nothing can go in and out right now.
A   of more than 100 trucks carrying aid is waiting on the Egyptian side for the Israeli nod. Several countries such as Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have sent planeloads of aid to El Arish Airport in Sinai.
The two   in Gaza are Beit Hanoon, known as Erez to Israelis, and Karem Abu Salem, known to Israelis as Karem Shalom. The latter is a commercial crossing and Beit Hanoon is open only to those with Israeli-issued permits for emergencies such as medical treatment. Both crossings are controlled by Israel and have been closed under the siege.

Did Israel bomb the Rafah crossing?
Israel has   the Rafah border crossing, causing significant damage to its Palestinian side.
"Israeli bombed the crossing on the third day of this operation so the roads are not really ready to be used," Mahjoob Zweiri, director of the Gulf Studies Center at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera. He added that efforts need to be made for the roads to become functional for use.
On October 10, Israel's military said they could 'neither confirm nor deny' an attack on the crossing 'at this point',   AFP news agency.
Has Egypt closed the Rafah crossing?
Egyptian officials have said that the crossing is  , but inoperable due to Israeli strikes on the Gaza side.
Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said that Cairo aims to   but is waiting for a green light from Israel which is not "co-operating", according to Reuters.
According to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Israel's concern with opening the crossing is that Hamas may seize or destroy aid or prevent it from reaching Gaza.
Zweiri from Qatar University said that aside from road damage, the major concern with opening the crossing is that it may be used to   of Gaza.
"Egyptians want to make sure that Rafah crossing will not be used to push other Palestinians outside of Gaza and Israelis cannot give such assurances," he said.
In an   aired on Friday, Israel's former Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said that people in Gaza should simply relocate to the "endless expanse" available in the Sinai Desert in Egypt.
This has raised fears that Palestinians, the majority of whose families were forcibly removed in 1948 from territories that are now Israel, would face a second ethnic cleansing.
Richard Brennan, WHO regional emergency director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said the decision to open the crossing is ultimately "a political one" that involves various considerations.
Will the US push Israel to allow aid?
US President Joe Biden, who is heading to Israel and later to Jordan on Wednesday, is likely to discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
On Tuesday,   that US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would develop a plan to get humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza, without providing details.
At a press conference in Cairo on Tuesday, WHO officials also stated that they had meetings with Egyptian officials to discuss the passage of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Brennan said WHO was "vigorously advocating" for a sustained and unhindered   into Gaza at the highest levels of the organisation, including with the United Nations and government representatives.
"We have been assured by the Egyptian Red Crescent – which is managing the aid effort across the border into Gaza – that our supplies [medical supplies and water] will be given priority," said Brennan.
Has any aid been able to enter Gaza?
Juliette Touma, director of communications at the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), confirmed that no supplies had come into Gaza for UNRWA or other UN agencies.
"No supplies have come into Gaza since October 7," she said at a press conference on Monday. "Nothing – no fuel, no food, no water, no other types of assistance."

US top diplomat Blinken visits Israel, urges protection of Gaza civilians

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has visited Israel to express strong solidarity but also urges restraint to protect Palestinian civilians as the Israeli bombarding of Gaza continues for the sixth day.
The US top diplomat met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly after landing in Tel Aviv on Thursday, telling him: "We're here. We're not going anywhere."
Netanyahu praised Blinken's visit as a 'tangible example of America's unequivocable support of Israel".
Blinken said that he came before journalists 'not just as secretary of state, but also a Jew' while recounting his own family's history of surviving the Holocaust.
'So prime minister, I understand on a personal level, the harrowing echoes that Hamas' massacres carry for Israeli Jews, as well as Jews everywhere,' Blinken said, before calling for the protection of Gaza's civilian population.
'We democracies distinguish ourselves from terrorists by striving for a different standard even when it is difficult and holding ourselves accountable when we fall short,' Blinken said at a joint news conference with Netanyahu.
' That's why it is so important to take every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians and that's why we mourn the loss of every innocent life, civilians of every faith, every nationality ' he added.
His visit came after thousands of Israeli missiles killed at least 1,378 Palestinians since Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza, attacked Israel on Saturday.
At least 1,300 Israelis were also killed and dozens were taken captive by Hamas over the last six days.
Israeli army spokesperson Richard Hecht said on Thursday the military was readying for a potential order to launch a ground invasion in the war with Hamas: "This has not been decided yet … But we are preparing for a ground manoeuvre if it is decided."
"Right now we are focused on taking out their senior leadership," he told journalists.
Fears have grown for most of Gaza's 2.3 million residents now enduring the fifth war in 15 years in the long-blockaded territory, which has also seen Israel cut off water, food and power supplies.
US President Joe Biden also cautioned on Wednesday that Israel must, despite "all the anger and frustration … operate by the rules of war".
'When reporters have pressed the White House and the State Department, asking 'how can civilians in Gaza be protected from these bombardments when they are already dying by the hundreds' … we have gotten evasive answers, that it was Hamas's fault for using civilians as human shields,' Al Jazeera's Heidi Zhou-Castro, reporting from Washington, DC, said.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, concerned about the "supercharged cycle of violence and horror", urged the release of all captives and the lifting of the siege and stressed that "civilians must be protected at all times".
"The human misery caused by this escalation is abhorrent," said the International Committee of the Red Cross Middle East chief, Fabrizio Carboni, who stressed that hospitals without electricity "risk turning into morgues".
There have been calls for a humanitarian corridor to allow Palestinians to escape before a possible Israeli ground invasion that would spell brutal urban combat and house-to-house fighting.
Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said the total siege of Gaza would continue until the captives are freed.
"Humanitarian aid to Gaza? No electric switch will be turned on, no water tap will be opened and no fuel truck will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home," he said in a statement.
Israel has called up 300,000 reservists and rushed forces, tanks and heavy armour to the southern desert areas around Gaza from where Hamas launched its unprecedented attack on October 7.
Israeli soldiers have since swept the southern towns and kibbutzim and killed about 1,500 fighters, according to military spokesperson Richard Hecht, while making ever more shocking discoveries of large numbers of dead civilians.
Threat from the north
Israel's war flaring in the south is further complicated by a threat from the north, the Iran-backed Hezbollah armed group based in Lebanon.
Israel has massed tanks on the border after repeated clashes with Hezbollah in recent days, including cross-border rockets and shelling.
The United States has deployed an aircraft carrier battle group to the eastern Mediterranean in a show of support and warned Israel's other enemies not to enter the conflict.
Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi said all Muslim and Arab countries must confront Israel and support the "oppressed Palestinian nation", in a phone call with his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad, according to the Iranian presidency website.
Blinken was on Friday due to visit Jordan and meet King Abdullah II as well as the president of the Palestinian Authority, MahmoudAbbas.

Beit Ummar, occupied West Bank – Fidaa Abu Maria bustles around her simple, sparse home in Beit Ummar north of Hebron, worried then hopeful then scared, in turn.
After she makes her son's bed, she turns to folding his freshly laundered clothes, seeming to whisper prayers to herself with each fold.
Her son, Ubai, may be coming home, and she wants to be ready, needs that little burst of hope and optimism.
His name was on an Israeli list of 300 people who may be released in an upcoming swap between Hamas and Israel. Fifty captives taken by Hamas to Gaza will be released, to be exchanged for 150 Palestinian women and child prisoners in Israeli jails – that means there is a 50/50 chance that Fidaa may see Ubai soon.
She constantly worries about him because when Ubai was arrested by Israeli forces on August 8, four months after his 18th birthday, he only had 30 percent use of one of his hands.
Ubai Youssef Abu Maria [Mosab Shawer/Al Jazeera]
He had been shot in the elbow last November and had been undergoing various therapies to regain the use of his hand. But his treatment stopped once he was in the Israeli prison system.
Like many young Palestinian boys, this was sadly not the first time Ubai was arrested, he had been taken four times before that.
At the beginning of his detention, Ubai was assaulted by the prison guards, resulting in injuries to his head, and isolated for 14 days.
"His detention had so many beatings and assaults. I was so scared for his health because of the injury to his hand and because he hadn't had a chance to get the surgery he was scheduled for. They were supposed to replace his wrist joint, but it never happened.
"Since October 7, we've been hearing that things got worse for prisoners in the occupation prisons, that they were all assaulted and deprived of the most basic rights such as food, clothing, things like that."
Youssef Abu Maria couldn't hold back his tears when he talked about Ubai [Mosab Shawer/Al Jazeera]
Ubai's father, Youssef, could barely hold his excitement and worry in. "We've been hopeful for a while now, and this morning, a friend called me. He follows Hebrew media, and he woke me up early in the morning to tell me Ubai's name is on the list.
"I've been arrested before, and given the 30 times I was arrested, I see the release of my son as if he's going to be reborn. Prisoners are attacked so much in the occupation prisons.
"We are so grateful to the people of Gaza, especially the martyrs and the wounded. All of this is thanks to God first and thanks to the valiant resistance that brought our sons out from darkness to light."
Favourite foods and fresh linens
The Abu Maria home is sparse and very simple, neat as a pin and filled with the anxious excitement of the family members. Fidaa flits from one chore or another to sit on one of the beds in the family room to listen to the news.
Ubai's brothers and cousin in the neat-as-a-pin family room [Mosab Shawer/Al Jazeera]
"I'm happy. My feelings are like any Palestinian mother would have when she hears her son may be released: full of joy, but it is bittersweet because our tiny little joy is at the expense of the blood of the people in Gaza. I am grateful, so grateful.
"I've been cooking. I'm making his favourite food, stuffed zucchini in yoghurt sauce and the desserts he loves, homemade chocolate cakes. He prefers my baking to any other cakesbecause I am a home pastry chef.
"I keep saying that I will happily make him dessert for breakfast every single day, as much as he wants. I've set up his room and laundered his new clothes. Everybody is calling me, family and friends. Everyone is excited and wants to come share our joy and welcome him."
Youssef helped as much as he could, then embarked on his own project, decorating the house inside and out to express the family's almost unbearable hope and joy.
All that remained were the most difficult moments to wait for the news of the release.

How far will Europe's leaders back Israel on its Gaza war?

October 26th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Since the October 7 Hamas attacks on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people, European leaders have paraded through Tel Aviv in what appears to be a turning point in support for Israel.
The heads of the governments of France, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Greece and Italy have taken turns standing beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the past few days.
'In such difficult times, there is only one place we can be: at Israel's side,' said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, while visiting 10 days after the Hamas attack.
Yet the visits represent a more complex diplomatic calculation than the photo ops might suggest, say analysts. On the one hand, the trips underscore a shift in Europe's readiness to publicly back Israel. On the other hand, the visits reflect an unease over the implications for regional security and the fears of another refugee crisis if the war escalates, as is expected with an imminent Israeli ground invasion – one that Europe wants Netanyahu to be careful about rushing into.
'Watershed' support
'It's the first time [Israel] is getting such EU support. It's a watershed,' said George Tzogopoulos, an expert in international relations at the Athens-based Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy (ELIAMEP).
European statements on Israel have traditionally been cautious, urging a two-state solution and arguing against anything that could escalate attacks on either side.
Since October 7, Europe's tone has shifted.
'We will destroy Hamas,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a week after the attack as Israeli forces cleared Hamas fighters from Israeli territory and began to go on the counteroffensive with preliminary raids into Gaza. 'This is only the beginning,' he said.
The European Union first threatened to   for Palestinians. While it eventually decided against that approach, the bloc's chief, Ursula von der Leyen, has been unequivocal in her support for Israel, even as the bombing of Gaza has killed more than 7,000 people, and an Israeli siege of the strip has forced many hospitals to shut down. Von der Leyen's position has   from hundreds of EU staffers.
'I think the Western leaders are expressing their absolute, sincere, unapologetic support for Israel's war with Hamas,' Aristotle Tziampiris, professor of international relations at the University of Piraeus, told Al Jazeera.
Europe's concerns
Tziampiris said there is 'no doubt' that a ground war will happen. 'It's a question not of if, but when and how,' he said.
That is where Europe wants to try and influence Israel.
In the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack, Europe, Tziampiris said, fears 'future attacks, in Israel with a potential spillover effect in other regions'.
Spillover effects could include attacks in Europe, a refugee crisis, or both. It has happened before. Three simultaneous suicide attacks in the northern Paris suburbs killed 130 people in November 2015, and it was later found that two of the attackers had entered Europe through the Greek island of Lesvos as asylum seekers.
'Southern European countries, like Italy and Greece, are concerned about the ramifications of a wider regional war involving Iran that could create a massive refugee crisis,' Emmanuel Karagiannis, senior associate professor of international security at King's College London told Al Jazeera.
But Europeans and Americans also want to put old feuds to rest, he said.
'American and European leaders are firm supporters of the Abraham Accords normalising relations between Israel and some Arab countries,' said Karagiannis. 'The current war in Gaza jeopardises the ongoing peace process in the Middle East at a time when the West needs to confront Russia in Ukraine and deter China over Taiwan.'
The balance sought by Europe therefore appears to be a destruction of Hamas that avoids reseeding hatred and leading to a new cycle of violence. So, EU leaders have laced their solidarity with advice – to show restraint and humanity.
'Civilian casualties and regional escalation must be prevented,' Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte wrote on X, formerly Twitter, after meeting Netanyahu. 'This requires restraint from Israel when it comes to the use of force.'
The Netherlands and the United Kingdom have called for 'humanitarian pauses' to allow medicine, food and fuel into Gaza, where hospitals are reported to have run out of supplies.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has   in the war to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Eye on the future
Israel has   in through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, but Gaza's Ministry of Health and international aid groups say water and other basic needs are not being met.
The United States, traditionally Israel's staunchest ally, has also urged restraint.
US President Joe Biden said he 'cautioned the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage' during a visit on October 18.
'After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes,' Biden said.
Optimists see an opportunity in this crisis for the international community to play a more constructive role.
The world, Tziamparis said, might have an opportunity to rebuild Gaza with "more democracy, more rights, more growth" while also ensuring security guarantees for Israel.
EU leaders appear to acknowledge that however the war plays out, when it ends, Israel and Palestinian leaders will need to sit down for talks to coexist.
French President Emmanuel Macron said the fight against Hamas "must be without mercy but not without rules" and repeated the need for a two-state solution. So did Rutte. 'Peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians is only possible if prospects for a Palestinian state, alongside a secure Israel, are renewed,' he wrote on X.
Whether Netanyahu heeds their messages might soon become clear.

The Israeli military has said one of its soldiers was killed by an anti-tank missile reportedly shot by the Palestinian armed group Hamas during a raid into the Gaza Strip by the Israeli Army.
Three other soldiers were injured in the raid on Sunday, said the statement that came as the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, announced on its Telegram account that it had pushed Israeli forces back into Israel.
One Israeli soldier was killed, while "one was moderately injured, and two were lightly injured as a result of an anti-tank missile", the Israeli military said.
The military said the purpose of the raid was to locate Hamas captives in Gaza's Khan Younis area and to "thwart terrorist infrastructure".
Israeli forces have been conducting raids across the border that they say are meant to clear the area and gather intelligence about captives being held by Hamas.
According to Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Khan Younis in Gaza, the raids are forcing Hamas to prepare for a  .
'These kinds of Israeli attempts to enter the Gaza Strip [are being] confronted by the Palestinian fighters, who are trying to get ready enough in order to confront any possible, potential ground invasion inside the besieged territory,' Azzoum said.
He added that the situation on the ground is 'really dramatic' and that the security conditions inside the Gaza Strip are 'unpredictable'.
Al Jazeera's Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said the killing of the soldier is something the Israeli army will be 'taking very seriously' as the war continues.
The incident occurred as Israel has   for more than two weeks, in response to a surprise incursion by Hamas into Israel on October 7.

Here is the situation on Wednesday,  , 2023:
Latest on human impact and fighting
Ambulances and rescue services are no longer operational in Gaza City, according to a report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) on Tuesday.
At least 11,078 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza since October 7, according to the last available toll from November 10. An additional 2,700 people – including an estimated 1,500 children – are believed to be trapped under rubble, either dead or awaiting rescue, according to UN OCHA.
Israel's far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich has touted the 'voluntary migration' of Palestinians in Gaza as the 'right humanitarian solution' for the besieged enclave and region in a Facebook post on Tuesday. The remark comes amid hundreds of thousands of people being   in Gaza since October 7, and   Israeli officials that Arab nations should take them in.
On Tuesday, the United States and the United Kingdom announced a   on Hamas and some of its leaders to restrict their funding channels.
Yemen's Houthi group launched   on Israeli targets, a spokesperson of the group said on Tuesday. Israel's military has not confirmed a Houthi attack but said its "Arrow" aerial defence system intercepted a missile near the Red Sea on Tuesday.
After reporting a $6bn deficit in October, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved  an amended state budget for 2023 in response to the Israel-Hamas war.
A "children for children" captive release is under negotiation, according to Israeli television station, Kan.
The situation at Gaza's hospitals
Israeli troops have entered   Hospital's surgical and emergency units. Tanks have been surrounding the hospital, Israeli soldiers searched the basement and also opened fire inside the hospital on Wednesday, medical sources told Al Jazeera.
The White House said on Tuesday that it does "not support striking a hospital from the air", and does not want to see civilians and patients there get caught in crossfire, according to Reuters, citing an unnamed spokesperson for the White House National Security Council.
Earlier on Tuesday, hours before Israeli forces stormed the hospital, national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that the White House had intelligence indicating Hamas tunnels under al-Shifa. Hamas rejected these claims in a statement on Wednesday, and said that the   of this narrative is responsible for the attack on al-Shifa Hospital.
Human Rights Watch has called for Israel's attacks on Gaza hospitals to be investigated as war crimes, in   released on Tuesday.
Diplomacy
Netanyahu slammed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for calling on Israel "to exercise maximum restraint" and saying that the killing of women and children needs to stop. 'It is not Israel that is deliberately targeting civilians but Hamas,' Netanyahu wrote in a social media post directed at Trudeau on Wednesday.
Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden discussed the latest developments   during a phone call on Tuesday. The White House readout of the call did not mention hospital attacks as a point of discussion and stated that the two spoke "at length" about securing captives.
Meanwhile, thousands of protesters gathered in San Francisco to protest against Israel's war on Gaza and get world leaders to push for a ceasefire ahead of a   on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
The US has been ramping up its   to Israel with increased arsenals and new equipment, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday citing an internal defence department list. Some of the items delivered include cannon ammunition, bunker-buster munitions, and night-vision devices.
Indonesia and Malaysia's defence ministers called for a ceasefire in Gaza during a regional meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on Wednesday.
Attacks in the occupied West Bank
Eleven Palestinians were arrested in Israeli raids across the West Bank on Wednesday, according to Wafa news agency.
Israeli forces demolished a Palestinian family's house in Shuqba village, west of Ramallah, at dawn on Wednesday under the pretext of building without a permit. The family was informed about the demolition decision via a phone call one week ago, according to Wafa.

Fears for Khaled El Qaisi's wellbeing after his release in Israel

Khaled El Qaisi, 28, has not been heard from since he was released by Israeli authorities on October 1 and told to speak to nobody until October 8.
The Palestinian Italian researcher with the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network had spent a month in arbitrary Israeli detention after being arrested as he was crossing from Palestine into Jordan at the Allenby Bridge.
He endured five hearings without knowing what the charges against him were. Four of the hearings had ended with him remanded into custody.
At the fifth hearing, he was released under strict conditions.
All his family knows about him now is that he was released in Ramallah, was picked up by an uncle and taken to Bethlehem, and is not allowed to speak to anyone for a week, at the end of which he may finally learn his fate.

El Qaisi's parents have not seen him since his release, according to a relative of his who spoke to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.
'Even his mother. He's not allowed to speak to his mother!' his relative said.
A brutal end to an idyllic time
El Qaisi had been visiting Bethlehem – where he was raised by his Italian mother and Palestinian father – with his wife Francesca Antinucci and their four-year-old son. They spent a month there, their first visit as a family, getting to know El Qaisi's family and friends.
Antinucci said she and El Qaisi had been dreaming of the trip for years. They wanted to register their marriage there, and the birth of their son, but the COVID pandemic and other things had set the trip back.
"Our return from the idyl in Palestine came to such an abrupt halt at the border with Jordan," she said.
"We had been through the Palestinian authorities' rigorous checks, but then suddenly we found ourselves detained by Israeli authorities. They looked through our luggage several times, then ordered Khaled to stand up. Then they handcuffed him and took him away.'
Her son, Antinucci said, is still traumatised by what he saw. "He couldn't comprehend what was happening to his father. He was petrified, standing there watching his father being handcuffed and then vanishing," she said.
Israeli authorities then confiscated everything that Antinucci had with her, and she was left with no phone and no money.
A small camera that her son had been taking photos with throughout the holiday was also confiscated. It had been a gift from El Qaisi's family.
After she was interrogated about her husband's private matters and political orientation, Antinucci and her son were taken across the border into Jordan, where they were left with no belongings and no way to get anywhere.

'Eventually, some Palestinian women helped us, they gave us the money to take a taxi to Amman.'
In Amman, Anitinucci went to the Italian embassy, starting a mission that she has maintained since then, reaching out to Italian and other authorities to intervene in El Qaisi's case and get him back home.
Free Khaled
Antinucci said she has not heard from El Qaisi since his arrest and he has not had access to a lawyer.
"While we're relieved that he's been released and is now outside those prisons, we're still not at ease," she said.
Amnesty International Italy said  El Qaisi had been held in a number of Israeli detention facilities, including Ashkelon prison, where he was 'held in solitary confinement for 14 days and prevented from having regular contact with his family and his lawyers'.
Al Jazeera reached out to the Israeli police who directed inquiries to the Shin Bet internal security services, which in turn did not provide comment regarding El Qaisi's detention and charges against him before publication.
The Israeli army responded that it 'has no comment on this matter'.
The conditions under which El Qaisi was held could 'potentially be considered a crime under international law' according to Amnesty International Italy. Violations against him included 'sleep deprivation, threats, verbal abuse and prolonged imposition of stress positions', the human rights organisation said.
Antinucci and the El Qaisi family's lawyer, Flavio Rossi Albertini, founded the Free Khaled Committee, holding public protests that have brought thousands to the streets, calling upon the Italian government to bring El Qaisi home.
An online petition demanding his release has gathered some 30,000 signatures but the Italian government has seemingly been reluctant to take a strong stance, for which it has been widely criticised.
"The most effective course of action would undoubtedly be a prompt stance from the Italian government, but regrettably, it appears reluctant to take action," Albertini told Al Jazeera.
Antinucci is also disappointed, scared and frustrated that her husband is alone throughout this ordeal. She also, like the rest of the family, fears that charges against El Qaisi will be announced on October 8, and that they will be based on information that was extracted from him during a time when he was sorely mistreated and deprived of legal advice.
But she is determined to carry on until he is safe, and to "embody the resilience that Khaled would want me to display".

Analysis: Propaganda, deception, fake news and psychological warfare

October 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs has called Israel's already notorious directive that all civilians should evacuate the northern part of the Gaza Strip 'fake propaganda'.
Whoever wrote that is dead wrong, and was certainly not involved in the planning of last week's armed incursion into Israel carried out by the Palestinian group's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. The last thing that matters in any propaganda operation is whether there is any truth in it.
Multiple surprise breaches of Israel's security barriersbetween it and Gazawere carried out in a very determined and efficient fashion, as were the executions and captures of members ofIsraeliarmed forces and civilians in the settlements swarmed by Hamas's fighters.
But the main purpose of the attack was not military, except possibly to the limited degree of taking hostages who can be used as human shields in case of (expected) Israeli armed retaliation on the ground. The real purpose of the action was Hamas's desire to demonstrate what it is capable of, militarily and in terms of willingness to use extreme violence.
The action was planned as a message saying 'This is what we can and will do' – and as such it falls under that important, even crucial, part of the art of war we call psychological warfare.
The term may be new – it was first used barely 80 years ago, at the beginning of World War II – but the actions it describes are as old as warfare itself, as old as humanity.
From time immemorial, military commanders knew that they stood a better chance of being victorious in battle if their enemy was weakened and demoralised by fear and uncertainty.
Ancient warrior chiefs knew that surprise is one of the most efficient military tactics. If you make your foes guess when and how you will attack, and especially if you make them expect you at a different place at a different time, you have already half won your battle. The other half of victory is achieved by striking your enemy when and where he did not expect you and overcoming his weakened resistance.
Many wars in the past have been won without ever waging or winning one decisive battle. US senator and former military officer in the Vietnam War, John McCain, stated that Vietnamese Commander-in-Chief General Vo Nguyen Giap beat the United States in war but never in battle. In that sense, Hamas beat Israel in last weekend's battle, but it has not won the war. Yet it scored an important propaganda victory.

Scenes of Hamas machinegunning Israelis – soldiers and civilians – caused outrage in Israel and most of the Western world. But in the eyes of many Palestinians, most of the rest of the Arab world and many Third World countries, the armed fighters demonstrated determination, nerves of steel, skill in the use of modern military technologies and total disregard for their own lives in an action that proved that underdogs can successfully challenge the domination of the big and the mighty. In that vast part of the world, Hamas scored an important propaganda victory.
In Israel and in the West, it shot itself in the foot, giving additional proof to those who consider Hamas fighters cold-blooded murderers and 'terrorists'. It also unified Israelis who rallied together regardless of differences in politics or opinions.
Was Hamas aware of the effect the raid would produce? Certainly, but it obviously calculated that it was worth it for them to show themselves in a new light and againraiseawareness of the Palestinians' plight.
The Israeli response was as expected: first came deliberate aerial bombing of Gaza with doubtful military effect, and then came an immediate psychological warfare campaign. Propaganda and guns – a classic military strategy.
(Al Jazeera)
Israel's call to civilians to evacuate northern Gaza in 24 hours is pure propaganda in the function of war. Every military planner knows that even under extreme threat, civilians, who cannot be disciplined the way armies can, who resist attempts to instil order, who try to take with them possessions that slow them down, and try to find alternative routes and means etc, may only cover 20-25km (12.5-15.5 miles) in a day.
But when their numbers swell, with even 10,000 being huge, not to mention a million, they will simply block every road, including ones needed by the military to manoeuvre, and create chaos, panic and demoralisation.
This is exactly what Israel intended to do, but it succeeded only partially. Why? We'll examine it tomorrow.
Just to add that I was right about the Israeli land attack on Gaza not happening on Friday night. I believe it will not happen today, either.
But I will notsayit might not happen next weekend. That might be a realistic time for theIsraeli armyto have achieved their desired level of operational readiness.

Waves of bombs pound Gaza as the Israeli offensive approaches two weeks and the region teeters on a knife's edge. Here's the Middle East this week:

Al Jazeera reporter's family receives Israeli threat to leave Gaza home

October 30th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The family of an Al Jazeera correspondent in the Gaza Strip has received a threatening phone call claiming to come from the Israeli army, warning them to immediately leave their home as Israel steps up its bombardment of the besieged enclave.
Youmna ElSayed's husband received the call on Monday and was told to flee Gaza City and head south, even though there are no safe routes out of the area.
ElSayed said the phone call came from a private number. "The caller addressed my husband with his full name and told him that, 'This is the Israeli army, we are telling you to evacuate south because in the coming hours it is going to be very dangerous in the area where you are at'," she said, with the sound of explosions going off all around her.
The correspondent said there are seven families comprising about 100 people who currently live in the building, but only hers was contacted. "None of the other six families got a warning call from the Israeli military, like we did, so this was a direct threat just to us, to our family."
ElSayed said it was too "risky" to flee amid the heavy Israeli bombardment that has intensified as Israel deepens its ground offensive inside the Gaza Strip. On Monday, Israeli tanks reached the outskirts of Gaza City and briefly cut the main road linking the north of the Strip to its south.
"I don't know how safe it would be to actually take our car and leave and drive under this heavy bombardment. It's very risky, it doesn't seem safe at all," said ElSayed, adding that the continuing bombardment in the south does not offer any guarantees that people moving there will be safe.
The Israeli army in recent weeks has warned the 1.1 million people living in northern Gaza, including Gaza City, to evacuate south as it steps up its attacks following a surprise assault by Hamas, the group running the Strip, inside Israel more than three weeks ago. However, residents say nowhere is safe and there are no safe routes to evacuate as the most intense bombardment in recent memory continues.
In a statement, Al Jazeera said it "condemns the Israeli threat" towards ElSayed and her family.
"This vile threat comes only a few days after the indiscriminate   of the family of Al Jazeera Arabic's journalist, Wael al-Dahdouh, who were asked to move south before being bombed," it said.
On Tuesday, an Israeli attack killed Dahdouh's  , 44-year-old Amna; his 16-year-old son, Mahmoud; his seven-year-old daughter, Sham; and his grandchild, Adam.
Meanwhile, at least 29 journalists have been killed since the start of the war: 24 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese, according to a tally by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
"Israel's actions continue with impunity as they attempt to silence the messenger," Al Jazeera's statement said. "Al Jazeera strongly condemns these acts of violence and calls on international institutions to intervene and protect journalists and all innocent civilians."
Commenting on the phone call received by ElSayed's family, Sherif Mansour, the Middle East and North Africa programme coordinater at the CPJ, said his organisation was 'extremely alarmed'.
'A lot of Palestinian journalists have been taking a lot of risks reporting from Gaza,' Mansour told Al Jazeera.
'They face exponential risks and have already paid a heavy toll. Many of them have lost colleagues, media facilities, families and had to flee seeking safety when there is no safe haven or exit.'
Khadija Patel, chairperson of the International Press Institute, also described the threat as a 'very worrying' development.
'This is an indication of deliberate targeting of journalists, something that we are concerned about as part of a trend that we are seeing within this conflict,' she told Al Jazeera.
'We want to urge the Israeli forces to protect the lives and work of journalists in this war.'

November 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Hamas and Israel have expressed in statements their readiness to resume hostilities after they   to a Qatar-mediated pause in fighting.
The deal includes the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails in exchange for 50 people held captive by Hamas in Gaza since the armed group that rules the enclave stormed southern Israel on October 7.
Under the terms of the deal, Israel will halt all military actions in Gaza for four days, and allow hundreds of trucks carrying humanitarian and medical aid and fuel into the territory.
Here are the statements issued by the warring sides, as well as the mediator:
Qatar
"The State of Qatar announces the success of its joint mediation efforts undertaken with the Arab Republic of Egypt and the United States of America between Israel and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), resulting in an agreement for a humanitarian pause.
The starting time of the pause will be announced within the next 24 hours and last for four days, subject to extension.
The agreement includes the release of 50 civilian women and children hostages currently held in the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of a number of Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons, the number of those released will be increased in later stages of implementing the agreement.
The humanitarian pause will also allow the entry of a larger number of humanitarian convoys and relief aid, including fuel designated for humanitarian needs.
The State of Qatar affirms its commitment to ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions, stop the bloodshed, and protect civilians.
In this regard, the State of Qatar appreciates the efforts of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the United States of America in reaching this agreement."
Hamas
"Inspired by our responsibility towards our patient and determined Palestinian people, and our tireless endeavour to support the steadfastness of our heroic people in the dignified Gaza Strip, and to provide relief and treat their wounds, and in our work to consolidate the will of our victorious resistance on October 7 in the face of the Zionist enemy.
Following complex and difficult negotiations for many days, we announce, with the help of God Almighty, that we have reached a humanitarian truce agreement (a temporary pause in fighting) for four days, through the persistent and appreciated efforts of Qatar and Egypt, according to which [there will be]:
– A pause in fighting from both sides, a cessation of all military actions by the occupation army in all areas of the Gaza Strip, and a cessation of the movement of its military vehicles penetrating into the Gaza Strip.
– Allowing hundreds of trucks of humanitarian, relief, medical and fuel aid into all areas of the Gaza Strip, without exception, in the north and the south.
– The release of 50 women and children below the age of 19 years of the occupation detainees, in exchange for the release of 150 women and children below the age of 19 years of our people from the occupation prisons, all according to length of their imprisonment.
– Stopping air traffic in the south for four days.
– Stopping air traffic in the north for six hours a day, from 10am until 4pm.
– During the pause of fighting, the occupation is committed not to attack or arrest anyone in all areas of the Gaza Strip.
– Ensuring freedom of movement of people (from north to south) along Salah al-Din Road.
– The terms of this agreement were formulated in accordance with the vision of the resistance and its principles, which aim to serve our people and strengthen their steadfastness in the face of aggression, and it is always mindful of their sacrifices, suffering and concerns, and it conducted these negotiations from a position of steadfastness and strength in the field, despite the occupation's attempts to prolong and procrastinate the negotiations.
– While we announce the arrival of a pause of fighting agreement, we affirm that our hands will remain on the trigger, and our victorious brigades will remain on the lookout to defend our people and defeat the occupation and its aggression.
– We promise our people that we will remain loyal to their blood, their sacrifices, their patience, their steadfastness, and their aspirations for liberation and freedom, the restoration of rights, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, God willing."
Israel
"The Government of Israel is obligated to return home all of the hostages.
Tonight, the government has approved the outline of the first stage of achieving this goal, according to which at least 50 hostages – women and children – will be released over four days, during which a pause in the fighting will be held.
The release of every additional ten hostages will result in one additional day in the pause.
The government of Israel, [the Israeli army] and the security services will continue the war in order to return home all of the hostages, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that there will be no new threat to the State of Israel from Gaza."

'No safe place' in Gaza as Israeli attacks overwhelm hospitals

Israel's intense aerial attacks on the Gaza Strip   for a fourth straight day after Hamas, the group running the besieged enclave, sent thousands of rockets and fighters inside Israel in an unprecedented attack.
The bombardment   at least 770 Palestinians, including dozens of children, and wounded some 4,000 others. More than 900 people in Israel have also been killed in the Hamas attack, with at least 2,600 others wounded.
As Israel launched more than 200 air raids overnight on Tuesday, Palestinians in Gaza scrambled to find shelterin the tiny besieged enclave, home to 2.3 million people.
'I ran away from home at 1am with my child and my wife,' Gaza resident Shadi al-Hassi told Al Jazeera. 'We escaped from being targeted and came to another targeted place. We were surprised by everything, as fire and flames were thrown at us. There is no safe place in the Gaza Strip.'
Later in the day, there were scenes of panic at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where medical workers and relatives were seen rushing to bring wounded people, including many children.
Reporting from Gaza's largest hospital, Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed said healthcare workers were "overwhelmed".
"There is a white tent in the yard of the hospital, a [makeshift] extension to the morgue because they are full of bodies," she said. "Some of the families have already taken their relatives quickly … in order to empty the morgue. No funerals are being held due to the intensity of the bombing."
'Signs of war'
On Monday, Israel said it was imposing a "total blockade" on the territory, cutting off supplies of food, water, fuel and electricity. Such a siege, with the intent to starve a population, is a war crime under United Nations statutes.
Staff at Al-Shifa said there was a shortage of medicines, supplies and equipment while the power cuts exacerbated the situation.
'Gaza has had only four hours of electricity in the past two days,' ElSayed reported. 'The sole power plant here is saying it can only operate for a maximum of two more days after that," she said.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army on Tuesday said it had regained full control of the areas around the Gaza fence after days of fighting with Hamas gunmen. Spokesman Daniel Hagari said the army's engineering units were clearing the areas and holes in the fence with Gaza that was breached in the hours of Saturday by the Hamas fighters.
In the Israeli town of Ashdod, near Gaza, the sound of explosions could be heard 'every few minutes', Al Jazeera's Rob Reynolds reported.
'You can see and hear signs of the war from here,' Reynolds said.
The Israeli army has called up 300,000 reservists, raising fears it planned a ground offensive into Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas has threatened to kill a hostage, from the  , every time Israel bombs a Palestinian home without warning.

According to the World Health Organization, 13 attacks have hit health facilities since the fighting began, and pre-positioned medical supplies have already been used.
The UN agency has called for an end to the violence and an urgent need to create a humanitarian corridor into the Gaza Strip.
'WHO is calling for an end to the violence a humanitarian corridor is needed to reach people with critical medical supplies,' WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a press briefing in Geneva.
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that close to 200,000 people, or nearly a tenth of the population, were displaced and had fled their homes amid the intense fighting.
"Displacement has escalated dramatically across the Gaza Strip, reaching more than 187,500 people since Saturday. Most are taking shelter in schools," Jens Laerke, OCHA spokesperson said.
The Israeli blockade of the occupied Gaza Strip, in its current form, has been in place since June 2007. Israel controls Gaza's airspace and territorial waters, as well as two of the three border crossing points; the third is controlled by Egypt.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday he was "deeply distressed" by Israel's complete siege of the Gaza Strip which will worsen the already dire situation.

UN rights office says Israeli attacks on Jabalia could be 'war crime'

November 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United Nations human rights office has said the Israeli air attack on Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp could amount to a war crime, amid growing horror at the rising number of civilians killed in the nearly month-long war.
The camp, in a densely-populated part of Gaza City, was hit by a missile on Tuesday, leaving a giant crater amid bombed-out buildings before it was then targeted in a   on Wednesday.
The Gaza Government Media Office said at least 195 people had been confirmed dead with more than 100 thought to be missing beneath the rubble. Some 777 people were injured in the attacks, it added.
Israel said the attack targeted a Hamas commander.
"Given the high number of civilian casualties [and] the scale of destruction following Israeli air strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes," the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights wrote on X.
The comments follow a wave of condemnation from the United Nations, where officials expressed shock and horror at the attacks on Jabalia, Gaza's largest refugee camp.
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres "is appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza", his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
This includes "the killing of Palestinians, including women and children, in Israeli air strikes in residential areas of the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp", Dujarric added.
The UN's children's agency,UNICEF described the attacks as "horrific and appalling".
In said it was too early to know how many children were among the dead in Jabalia, but noted that more than 3,500 children had been killed since October 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking 200 captive, and Israel began its bombardment of Gaza in response.
Gaza, controlled by Hamas since 2006, is home to about 2.3 million people who have lived under a blockade for 17 years.
"This is just the latest atrocity to befall the people of Gaza where the fighting has entered an even more terrifying phase, with increasingly dreadful humanitarian consequences," Martin Griffiths, the UN humanitarian chief, said in a statement.
He said, "The world seems unable, or unwilling, to act," adding that "this cannot go on. We need a step change".
Israel said Jabalia was attacked because of a "vast" tunnel complex at the site, and that "many Hamas terrorists" had been killed, including local commander Ibrahim Biari, whom Israel accused of involvement in the October 7 attack.
Hamas claimed seven captives, including three foreigners, had been killed in the bombing.
Dujarric said that the secretary-general reiterated that all parties "must abide by international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution".
He also called on them to "bring an end to this shocking violence, pain and suffering".
The attacks on Jabalia came as the Rafah crossing on the southern border with Egypt was finally  , albeit only for the   and some foreign nationals.
The opening of the crossing also allowed Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency that works to help Palestinian refugees, to get into Gaza for the first time since the conflict began.
He met Palestinians taking shelter in a school.
Afterwards, he described the visit as " one of the saddest days " of his more than 30-year career as a humanitarian. He has worked previously in countries including Iraq, Somalia and Rwanda.
"The levels of distress and the unsanitary living conditions were beyond comprehension," Lazzarini said in a statement. "Everyone was just asking for water and food."
Lazzarini leads the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) and is the most senior UN official to be allowed into Gaza since October 7. More than 70 members of the agency's staff have been killed since the bombardment began, and Lazzarini paid tribute to those still trying to meet the needs of Gaza's people, describing them as a "ray of light".
He reiterated his call for more international aid, and for a ceasefire.
'The current humanitarian response is by far not enough, nor does it match the huge needs of people in Gaza," he said, noting the lack of fuel and its "devastating impact on hospitals, bakeries, water plants, and our operations. A humanitarian ceasefire is long overdue. Without it, more people will be killed, those who are alive will endure further losses, and the once vibrant society will be in grief, forever".

Qatari emir says Israel should not be given 'free licence to kill' in Gaza

The emir of Qatar has called on the international community to restrain  , saying Israeli forces should not be given a green light for unconditional killing in the besieged Gaza Strip.
In his opening speech at the Shura council's annual session on Tuesday, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani also said the continuing war was a dangerous escalation that threatened the region.
"We are saying enough is enough," he said. "It is untenable for Israel to be given an unconditional green light and free licence to kill, nor it is tenable to continue ignoring the reality of occupation, siege and settlement."
The emir went on to condemn the violence against innocent civilians on both sides, but also faulted the international community for "double standards" and "acting as if Palestinian children's lives are not worth to be reckoned with, as though they are faceless or nameless".
Sheikh Tamim's latest comments on the conflict came more than two weeks after Israel launched a devastating campaign of air raids on Gaza after Hamas fighters carried out a surprise attack on southern Israel.
More than 1,400 people were killed in the Hamas  , mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities. Israel has since bombarded Gaza relentlessly, killing more than 5,000 people, 40 percent of whom are children, according to Palestinian officials. It has also imposed a 'complete siege' on the territory, cutting supplies of food, water and fuel.
"It should not be allowed in our time to use cutting off water and preventing medicine and food as weapons against an entire population," the Qatari emir said, as he called for an end to this war that "has transcended all limits".
On Monday, Hamas said it had freed two hostages taken into the Gaza Strip from Israel for "compelling humanitarian" reasons following mediation by Qatar and Egypt.

WHO says aid 'ready to go' into Gaza as Israeli bombardment continues

Five trucks of medical supplies are ready at the border between Gaza and Egypt, the World Health Organization has said, amid warnings of a looming humanitarian catastrophe in the besieged Palestinian territory.
"Our trucks are loaded and ready to go," WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference. He said he hoped the supplies would be delivered as soon as the Rafah crossing opened, "hopefully tomorrow".
Egyptian state-linked media reported on Friday that the   would open on Friday.
US President Joe Biden announced the deal with Israel and Egypt to allow aid into Gaza after what he called "blunt" talks with leaders of both countries. Israel consented to the deal while pressing on with its military campaign.
The expected   is set to be the first after Israel said it would impose a "total blockade" on the besieged Gaza Strip that is home to 2.3 million people, cutting electricity supplies and halting flows of food and fuel, in response to a devastating attack from Hamas on Israeli territory on October 7. At least 1,400 people were killed in the attack, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel has bombarded Gaza relentlessly since the Hamas attack, killing more than 3,700 people and wounding thousands of others, according to Palestinian officials.
The UN has warned of a "humanitarian catastrophe" in Gaza where more than half the population lives in poverty amid a 16-year-old blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt.
Health services already strained by the blockade have come under huge pressure amid the Israeli assault.The WHO has previously warned that the healthcare system in Gaza is on the brink of collapse, with doctors forced to operate without anaesthetic, and some life-saving procedures – like dialysis – at risk of stopping.
Doctors from Gaza's only   have warned that they are running perilously low on fuel and could be forced to shut down.
The WHO's emergencies chief Mike Ryan said the UN agency would do everything in its power, along with the Egypt and Palestinian Red Crescent societies, to ensure the aid reached those who need it in Gaza rather than getting diverted.
The WHO supplies are part of an expected convoy of 20 trucks.
"Twenty trucks is a drop in the ocean of need right now in Gaza," Ryan added. "But hopefully this trickle will turn into a river of aid that will flow in the coming days."
He said the medical supplies, including wound dressings, anaesthetics, and painkillers, among other items.
Reporting from Gaza, Al Jazeera's Safwat Kahlout said that the enclave 'had run out of everything - not just food, water and fuel'.
'Twenty trucks of aid will not do much to improve the humanitarian situation here. But the hope now is that more trucks will follow, and the opening will not just be a one-off incident,' he added.
More than 100 trucks carrying aid have been   on the Egyptian side of the border, with the United Nations and others calling for urgent help for besieged civilians.
On a visit to Cairo, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said there needed to be "rapid, unimpeded humanitarian access" after dire warnings about the impact of the Israeli blockade.
"We need food, water, medicine and fuel now. We need it at scale and we need it to be sustained, it is not one small operation that is required," he added.
The Israeli assault on Gaza has left entire city blocks levelled and displaced more than one million people, the UN has said.
"The pace of death, of suffering, of destruction … cannot be exaggerated," said UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths.
There are fears the situation could deteriorate if Israel launches an expected ground invasion to target Hamas fighters and rescue Israeli and foreign hostages, whose known number Israel on Thursday revised up to 203.

We 'die slowly every single day': What survival means for one Gaza family

Gaza City - Abdulrahman and his family were among the many Palestinians travelling south along Salah al-Din Road – the main highway linking Gaza's north and south – when a huge explosion struck just a few hundred metres from where they were.
On Friday  , as families headed south following an Israeli  and promises of safe movement, at least   were killed in air attacks on vehicles leaving Gaza City.
"Surviving that air strike was like a miracle," said Abdulrahman Ammar who was in a car at the time with his five sisters and parents.
"The truck that was hit was full of people. Tens of families," the 26-year-old recalled, his face pale. "After the attack, we saw the bodies all over the road, scattered and torn apart. We felt like it was time for us too to die."
The attack initially left Abdulrahman and his family paralysed with fear and indecision.
"We didn't know what to do – go back or continue our way forward," he recalled. But then, 'we kept on moving towards the south and took refuge in a school".
But the respite from the war the family had hoped for was not to be found at the United Nations-run school.
"Not only did we suffer the lack of daily supplies like food and water but, as a family of six women, privacy wasn't found," recalled Sanaa, Abdulrahman's 25-year-old sister.
"We fled horror but we had so much else, like a bathroom, our rooms, our house, our space to sleep and eat," Sanaa said. "At the school, we had to locate ourselves in one classroom – a space of almost six square metres (about 65 sq ft) with 30 other strangers."
Women and children stayed inside the school while the men slept in the yard outside.
And throughout, Israel's bombardment of Gaza continued.

'We could feel the floors dance'
The nights - illuminated by the path of missiles and light from explosions - were accompanied by the screams of families huddled in the school.
'We could feel the floor dance,' Abdulrahman recalled.
Few could sleep. During rare moments of relative silence, the Ammars sat together and prayed for safety before joining their sleep-deprived companions to wait for sunrise.
The Ammar family had been among the first to flee for Gaza's south. But after a few days at the shelter, fearing that the bombing was getting closer and lacking essential amenities, they felt they had no option but to return to their home in Gaza City.
"We had not been left with much choice," Abdulrahman said of his family's decision.
The day they left, Abdulrahman and his family could not find a taxi, so they walked for almost 6km (3.7 miles) towards their home. '[We were] hugging our luggage and following a zigzag pattern so that we reduce the possibility of being harmed by any of the nearby air strikes," Abdulrahman recalled.
Eventually, they found a taxi and the family of eight, along with the clothing and the few other belongings they had with them, climbed into the vehicle.
They rode in silence, praying and staring out the windows at the scenes of destruction and at flattened neighbourhoods to the sounds of air sirens and warplanes.
All the while, the bombs rained down "everywhere around us", Abdulrahman said.

'What if we were hit?'
Abdulrahman's father, Suliman, who was sitting in the front seat, then spoke up, voicing what everyone else feared to say out loud: "What if we were hit by an air strike, just like what happened to the people on the truck the other day?"
His wife and children were silent.
Eventually, Walaa, who is in her mid-20s, said: "Then we would all die. It is that simple."
"It is for the better, if you all know, right? No hunger, no thirst, and more importantly – no fear.
"We will have eternal peace – peace that makes us rest from all that is making us suffer and die slowly every single day," she said.
As Israel carries out its   following an October 7 attack by Hamas fighters in the country's south - that killed at least 1,405 people - at least 5,791   have been killed, with more than half the victims being women and children.
About 1 million Palestinians have been displaced in the territory of 2.3 million.
Abdulrahman says his family's displacement - which evokes his ancestors' expulsion in 1948 during what Palestinians refer to as the  , or catastrophe, from Jaffa – has taught them a lesson about Israel's intentions.
"If Israel wants us to be safe, it shall return us to where we were forcibly displaced the first time, from our home in Jaffa,' he said.
'But I doubt that it wants that,' Abdulrahman reflected. 'It wants us in eternal exile and terrorised till the very end of our lives.'

Which countries have sent aid to Gaza so far?

October 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Two shipments of much needed aid arrived in Gaza this weekend – the first since Israel started bombing the Palestinian enclave in the wake of a deadly Hamas attack on October 7.
The besieged enclave, home to 2.3 million people, has been in dire need of humanitarian aid after Israel cut off food, fuel and electricity supplies before launching a military offensive.
More than 4,600 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in the relentless bombardments. Israel says it's targeting Hamas fighters who killed more than 1,400 people in the October 7 attack in southern Israel.
Here's what we know about the humanitarian aid being sent to Gaza:
Which countries have sent aid to Gaza?
At least   planes carrying aid from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan and Tunisia have landed at El Arish International Airport in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.
India has sent medical and disaster relief to El Arish on Sunday.
The European Union is launching an air bridge and has tripled its assistance to the territory.
However, some EU countries – including Germany, Denmark and Sweden – have temporarily suspended their aid to Gaza as a response to the Hamas attacks.
(Al Jazeera)
How many trucks have entered Gaza so far?
The first convoy of 20 trucks crossed from Egypt into Gaza on Saturday, and the second convoy arrived the day after.
More than 200 trucks carrying roughly 3,000 tonnes of aid have been positioned near the crossing on the Egyptian side waiting for Israeli approval to drive into Gaza.
Jeremy Hopkins, the UNICEF representative in Egypt, said this is not enough to cover the needs of the people in Gaza and instead there should be 'at least 100, 200 trucks going in per day'.
More than a million people have been displaced, and tens of thousands have been wounded and need urgent medical care in addition to the people needing food and other basic necessities.
What aid is being sent to Gaza?
The aid convoys have carried medical supplies from the World Health Organization (WHO), such as dressings, anaesthetics and painkillers.
The trucks have also contained food, including tuna tins, tomato paste and wheat flour.
They also have transported bottled drinking water. The first convoy had enough water for 27,000 people for one day, and the second had enough for 22,000 people for a day.
What other aid does Gaza require?
The UN humanitarian office said the volume of aid entering so far represents just 4 percent of the daily average needed before the hostilities and a fraction of what is now needed as food, water, medicines and fuel stocks run out.
The aid sent to Gaza does not include fuel, which is crucial, according to aid groups.
Doctors from Gaza's only cancer hospital have warned that they are running perilously low on fuel and could be forced to shut down.
Is the border between Gaza and Egypt open?
The aid entered through the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, which was opened to allow the small amount of aid to enter Gaza.
Supplies coming into Gaza through Rafah require Israeli approval.
Israel said it will not prevent humanitarian aid from entering Gaza through Egypt after pressure from its international allies to ease its 10-day siege on the Palestinian territory.
Trucks are waiting outside the border, so they can enter Gaza whenever the border opens next.
Hopkins said the border needs to be open on a continuous basis.

Negotiations ongoing for release of 10-15 Hamas captives, reports say

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Negotiations are continuing between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas, mediated by Qatar in coordination with the United States, that could see 10-15   released in exchange for a multiday pause in fighting, Hamas and Egyptian sources have told the Reuters and AFP news agencies.
The reports on Wednesday, citing anonymous sources familiar with the negotiations, said that details around a prospective deal remain uncertain.
'The exact number is still unclear at this stage,' an anonymous source told Reuters, which placed the number of captives that could be released at between 10 and 15.
AFP cited a source close to Hamas saying the talks "revolve around the release of 12 hostages, half of them Americans, in exchange for a three-day humanitarian pause'.
"There's a lot of talking going on, a lot of negotiating going on," said Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher. "Plus, you've got to add this to the mix: [Israeli Prime Minister]   said there would be no ceasefire unless all the captives are released. And that is a significant statement to make, particularly as he's spoken to [US President] Joe Biden on a number of occasions."
  has been a key player in talks securing the release of an estimated 240 captives held by Hamas, and most recently negotiated the handover of four captives.
'This is great news. It comes after communication between Washington and Tel Aviv over the last 48 hours. I think there was a huge effort by the Americans when it comes to the hostages,' researcher Mahjoob Zweiri, from Qatar University, told Al Jazeera.
While there have been discussions of a "tactical pause in the fighting", Fisher said that this was also dismissed by Netanyahu 24 hours ago, when he said that there will only be a ceasefire when all the captives are freed.
Netanyahu "will come under pressure in Israel if there is the possibility of freeing even some of the captives, if there is some sort of deal that can be done to free those captives, but those negotiations are still continuing - nothing concrete at the moment," Fisher reported.
Reuters, citing an Egyptian security source, said that a 24-48 hour pause in fighting, or narrowing of the main zone of fighting, is expected within the next week in exchange for the release of some hostages.
In a television address on Wednesday, Abu Obaida, a spokesperson for the armed wing of   said that the only way to guarantee the full release of captives was through a 'complete or gradual swap of prisoners',in a televised address on Al-Aqsa TV.
The Qassam Brigades's spokesperson said the group is holding women captives, as well as sick and elderly people and other civilians, but stressed that Israel is holding the same types of people in its prisons.
'This issue cannot be resolved except via a trade within each of these categories [of prisoners and captives] or in a comprehensive process that includes everyone,' he added.
More than 240 people, including Israeli soldiers and civilians as well as foreigners, were taken captive during   on Israel on October 7 that Israeli authorities said killed more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians.
That attack, which included Palestinian gunmen killing families and taking people hostage across towns in southern Israel, has been widely condemned, with rights groups and the United Nations calling for their immediate release.
Hamas has called for a  , demanding that Israel release thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons in Israel and the occupied West Bank.
In Israel, groups of families with   in Gaza have pressured Netanyahu to consider such a deal, which they have dubbed 'all for all'.
'As far as the families are concerned, a deal of a return of our family members immediately in the framework of 'all for all' is feasible, and there will be wide national support for this,' said MeIrav Gonen, a representative of one such group. Her daughter, Romi, is one of the captives.
Following reports on the latest negotiations, the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum said it welcomed "the return of each and every hostage".
It remains unclear how much Israel will prioritise the freeing of captives as it wages an   from land, sea, and air, with ground forces penetrating into Gaza City and air raids killing more than 10,569 people, including 4,324 children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza.

October 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Southern Israel – At a desolate, shopping complex near the coastal city of Ashkelon, a solitary figure ambles through an empty car park.
It is eerie. All the shops are shuttered. Escalators and children's rides are switched off. Swarms of flies feed off overflowing rubbish bins. Old food and plastic bags lie scattered across the tarmac.
The speaker system remains on and plays an endless loop of crackling elevator music – the gentle sound interrupted by the roar of aircraft overhead and several heavy thuds in the distance.
Several kilometres away lies the besieged Gaza Strip, which has been under intense Israeli bombardment for more than a week.
The impoverished enclave currently has no electricity. Fuel and water supplies are all but out. The medical system is on the brink of collapse.
Meanwhile, Israel has ordered 1.1 million people to leave the north of Gaza while it continues its air campaign.

'We don't know the future'
Omel, a stout 58-year-old man with a well-groomed grey beard, was born in the area and is one of the few remaining civilians to have stayed.
He had come to find some food for his 87-year-old father and brothers but all the shops closed so he walks back to his car.
He speaks cautiously, in a sombre tone, saying this current war "feels different" for locals due to the deaths and kidnapping of civilians. He himself has friends who have died.
It is estimated that   in the attack by Hamas's armed wing, including 286 soldiers. At least 2,750 Palestinians, a quarter of them children, have been killed in Israeli air raids on Gaza.
Omel's grandfather had come from the Netherlands to a kibbutz before his birth, and now he says his family refuses to leave.
He says the attack by Palestinian fighters took locals in the area by complete surprise, leaving them still in a state of shock.
"We don't know the future," he says, hunching his shoulders, adding, "but, we know that the Israeli government and the army are very strong".
Israeli military build-up by the border with Gaza
Three buses career into the car park alongside about a dozen military vehicles.
Young Israeli men dressed in military khakis disembark. The atmosphere is raucous, with plenty of back-slapping and sporadic chants. Many use the opportunity to smoke, others to take a toilet break in the unkempt shrubbery.
They appear to be some of the 360,000 reservists that Israel has called up after the surprise attack on southern Israel on October 7.
Military vehicles and buses drove into the car park [Al Jazeera]
In the military vehicles, there appear to be more seasoned soldiers wearing stern expressions and kitted out in full combat gear; one of them removes himself from the crowd and begins a standing prayer.
After a 30-minute break, they depart and head onto the road towards the border with Gaza.
Some look straight ahead, others flick through their phones. One group throw an Israeli flag over the side of the vehicle as they swerve around the roundabout.
A few minutes later, rockets from the enclave fly through the air. Israeli air defences kick into action. Bright streaks of light snake their way across the blue sky. Heavy explosions ring out overhead.
The closer to the Gaza border you get, the more Israeli flags you see draped along the highway.
Speeding passenger cars filled with armed Israeli soldiers weave their way around a stream of gargantuan transport vehicles carrying tanks.
On one side of the highway, more than 100 tanks and military vehicles line up in rows facing the Gaza Strip.
The highway is chequered with makeshift checkpoints. Cantekerous soldiers order civilians to turn back and get away from the border.
On the ground, everything points to a looming  .

'We started the offensive from the air. Later on, we will also come from the ground,' Defence Minister Yoav Gallant had told Israeli troops last week.
As night falls, near the now-evacuated town of Sderot where, a week ago, Israeli troops clashed with Hamas fighters, local shops, including a small blue-lit pizzeria and a bric-a-brac hookah store, are doing a roaring trade as an endless trail of soldiers loads up on supplies.
A long row of idle tanks stand silent in a gated industrial complex.
The street lights are switched off along the country roads that straddle the border with the Gaza Strip; the signposts are covered up. GPS systems often stop working.
It has been only a week since Israeli forces fought Palestinian fighters in the area, and preparations have been made to avoid another incursion.

Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza runs out of fuel, shuts down key services

November 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City has shut down 'most operations' after running out of fuel and withstanding daily Israeli bombardments around the medical complex since Sunday.
The hospital, located in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood and run by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), said it was forced to stop most services 'to ration fuel use and ensure a minimum level of services in the coming days'.
It has turned off its main generator and is now operating only a smaller generator to provide essential services and two hours of electricity a day to patients and 14,000 internally displaced people who are sheltering there. Its surgical ward and oxygen generation plant have been closed.
PRCS spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told Al Jazeera: 'We're talking about shelling about 15 metres [16 yards] from the hospital building. Most of the buildings around [the] hospital have been almost completely destroyed. The bombings are getting closer and closer to the hospital, and we fear a direct hit to the hospital.'
Most of the roads that lead to Al-Quds Hospital have been closed, forcing medics in ambulances to take a single, rugged, unpaved route to reach the injured.
'We have about 500 patients inside the hospital. We have 15 patients in the ICU. They are wounded and on respirators. We have newborns in incubators. We have 14,000 displaced people, the majority of whom are women and children,' Farsakh said.
The PRCS "has run out of options', it said, adding that it has been repeatedly warning for two weeks that "fuel supplies would run out if Israeli occupation forces continue to refuse to allow fuel to enter the Gaza Strip'.
Israel imposed a total siege on Gaza two days after the war began on October 7, tightening the existing blockade that has been in place since 2007 and severely curtailing the entry of aid, food, water, electricity and fuel.
According to Gaza's Ministry of Health, 18 hospitals have been put   since the war began, either because they ran out of fuel or due to bombardments.
Israeli bombardment has been ongoing since last night in the vicinity of Al-Quds Hospital from the western side.

Bashar Murad, emergency medical services director at the PRCS, who works at Al-Quds Hospital, described the situation at the facility 'as the most catastrophic' in the organisation's history.
'On Sunday, Israeli air strikes bombed the entrance of our hospital, resulting in the killing of four people at the entrance and the injury of 35 people, 12 of whom were inside the hospital,' Murad said.
He added that half of its ambulances are out of service while its central storage area has been hit and partially destroyed.
'We lost all medications and equipment in the storage worth around $5m,' said Murad, whose family has fled to Khan Younis.
'I stayed in Gaza [City] as I cannot leave work in these circumstances.'
Shelling near hospitals
Israel has been shelling near several hospitals in the past few days, killing and injuring patients and displaced people and further curtailing the provision of services.
Earlier on Wednesday, a mosque was hit near the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where many displaced Palestinians had moved after heeding Israel's calls to evacuate the north.
'Just 100 metres [110 yards] away from the [Nasser] Hospital, a mosque - the largest mosque in the area - was completely destroyed in an air strike,' Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud reported from Khan Younis.
'What's troubling about this air strike is it's in the middle of a busy road - a main road leading to the side gate of the hospital and also a busy market with so many people out there shopping for daily essentials,' he explained.
'There's also a bakery next to the mosque where hundreds of people at least were waiting for bread,' he said. The number of casualties wasn't immediately known.
The Israeli military has accused the Palestinian group Hamas of using hospitals in their military campaign against Israel.
"Hamas places forces and weapons inside, under and around schools, mosques, homes and UN facilities," Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters on Sunday."Among the worst of Hamas war crimes is the use of hospitals to hide their terror infrastructure."
Hamas has repeatedly rejected the charge.
The chairman of the Qatari Committee for the Reconstruction of Gaza, Mohammed al-Emadi, said Israel's allegation was a 'blatant attempt to justify the occupation's targeting of civilian facilities, including hospitals, schools, gatherings of population and shelters of displaced people'.
A recent Al Jazeera investigation has found that there are no grounds to support Israel's contention that a Hamas tunnel is under the Qatari-funded Sheikh Hamad Hospital in northern Gaza.

Hospitals and ambulances have been  . The World Health Organization said at least 39 health facilities, including 22 hospitals, have been damaged since the war began.
Gaza's Health Ministry said 193 health workers have been killed since the start of the war while 45 ambulances have been destroyed.
At least 10,569 Palestinians, including 4,324 children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the conflict erupted while entire neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble. About 1.5 million people are now internally displaced in Gaza, according to the United Nations.
More than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed in an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7, which started the latest Gaza war.

Israel-Hamas war affecting regional economies, warns IMF head

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The war between Israel and Hamas is already affecting the region's economies, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned.
"You look at the neighbouring countries – Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan – there the channels of impact are already visible," Kristalina Georgieva said at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh on Wednesday.
The IMF is concerned about the tragic loss of life in the epicentre of the war, but also the destruction and reduction of economic activity as a result of the raging conflict, she said.
"What is happening in the Middle East is happening at a time when growth is slow and interest rates are high and cost of servicing debt has gone up because of COVID and war," the IMF chief added.
Palestinian group Hamas staged a shock attack on Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people and taking about 220 hostages, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel has responded with the relentless bombardment of Gaza and a near-total land, sea and air blockade; Gaza's health ministry says 5,791 people have been killed in the besieged territory so far.
Georgieva spoke a day after Wall Street titans told the forum that the war could deal a heavy blow to the global economy, especially if it draws in other countries.
"What we see is more jitters in what has already been an anxious world," Georgieva said.
"You have tourism-dependent countries – uncertainty is a killer for tourist inflows," she said, describing the potential economic cost for countries in the region before listing specific risks.
"Investors are going to be shy to go to that place. Cost of insurance – if you want to move goods, they go up. Risks of even more refugees in countries that are already accepting more."
The annual FII event, dubbed "Davos in the Desert", has typically served as a chance for Saudi Arabia to showcase domestic economic reforms, the success of which, Saudi officials say, partly hinges on regional stability.
While several high-profile speakers have addressed the current regional turmoil, FII attendees have highlighted the capacity of Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, to withstand shocks and finance reforms using its deep-pocketed sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund.
Meanwhile, speaking to Israeli media on Wednesday, the country's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the direct cost of Israel's war on Gaza was about 1 billion shekels ($246m) a day.
He did not have an assessment of the indirect costs on an economy partly paralysed by the mass mobilisation of military reservists and rocket attacks by Palestinian armed groups.
Smotrich was also unfazed by S&P Global's downgrade on Tuesday of Israel's outlook from "stable" to "negative".
'The negative outlook reflects the risk that the Israel-Hamas war could spread more widely or affect Israel's credit metrics more negatively than we expect," the credit ratings agency said.
Smotrich called the downward revision "alarmist" and said he did not anticipate major Israeli deficits despite the crisis.

US diplomat Blinken meets Turkish FM for tough Israel-Gaza talks

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has met his Turkish counterpart as he continued a challenging Middle East tour aimed at easing regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas war.
Blinken met Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan for two and a half hours on Monday morning in Ankara but was snubbed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
'Blinken's main mission was to buy more time [for Israel],' Tamer Qarmoot, professor in public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera. 'And the Turks know this. That's why he got this cold reception.'
Blinken's trip to Turkey follows on the   of strained meetings with Arab leaders in Iraq, Palestine, and Jordan over the weekend.
Arab and Muslim leaders have   over Washington's staunch backing of Israel as it continues its monthlong assault on Gaza, killing nearly 10,000 people, more than a third of them children.
Washington has supported the need for a 'humanitarian pause' to the fighting but has stopped short of joining   in calling for a full truce.
Blinken's mission, his second to the region since the war began, has found limited support for his efforts to contain the fallout. Israel has rebuffed the US push for a pause to the fighting, while Arab and Muslim nations have insisted on an immediate ceasefire to ease the soaring casualties in Gaza.
Al Jazeera's Resul Serdar, reporting from Ankara, suggested that Blinken and Fidan found few points of agreement.
"The US side tried to convince Turkish officials to put more pressure on Hamas and make it release the captives," he said. "But the Turkish position was very clear on this matter. They said that the prisoner release should be mutual, where Hamas releases captives and Israel releases Palestinian prisoners."
"Turkey also asked for an unconditional ceasefire and said there should be an international mechanism to observe the ceasefire, which Ankara would be the guarantor for," Serdar continued. "But we haven't heard anything about a ceasefire from Blinken. He has been using the phrase humanitarian pause and the Turkish side has told him that this is not enough."
Turkey, which is a strategic US ally despite numerous foreign policy rifts, has been one of the region's fiercest critics of Israel since the war broke out, accusing Israel of behaving like a 'war criminal' and committing a 'massacre'.
On Saturday, Ankara   its ambassador from Tel Aviv, with Erdogan saying he had 'written off' dealing with Netanyahu.
The Turkish leader has delivered equally stinging criticism of Western powers that are backing Israel amid the Gaza bloodshed.
'Those who shed crocodile tears for the civilians killed in the Ukraine-Russia war are now quietly watching the killing of thousands of innocent children," Erdogan said last month.
Public anger
Turkey's frustration towards Washington was on clear display during Blinken's visit.
In an apparent snub, Erdogan ditched Blinken to travel across northeastern Turkey, leaving him to convene with his foreign minister.
Hours before the Blinken's arrival, hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside an airbase that hosts US troops in southeastern Turkey. Police reportedly broke up the protests with tear gas and water canisters.
"There is huge discontent here," Al Jazeera correspondent Resul Serdar, reporting from Ankara, said. "The organisers [of the protest] are trying to put a tremendous amount of pressure on US and Turkish governments to stop the war in Gaza."
Foreign policy rifts
The US's strained relationship with Turkey precedes the Hamas-Gaza war, with the two nations feuding over foreign policy issues ranging from NATO to Iraq.
Ankara is frustrated by the delay in approval from the US Congress for a $20bn deal for 40 F-16 fighter jets. Washington is waiting for Turkey to ratify Sweden's bid to join NATO.
Adding to tensions, the US has ramped up sanctions against Turkish entities it claims are helping Russia evade sanctions and import war-related goods.
Turkey is also angered by the US backing for Kurdish fighters in Syria who battled the ISIL (ISIS) but whom Ankara views as a part of the armed group Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), banned by Turkey, the US and the European Union.
Mediating role
As the Gaza war  , Erdogan has tried to position Turkey as a broker to stop the violence and move towards an independent Palestinian state.
He has said Ankara is "working behind the scenes" with regional allies to forge a ceasefire and secure an uninterrupted stream of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
"Our priority is to establish a humanitarian ceasefire quickly," Erdogan said on Friday, adding that Turkey was working on "new mechanisms that will guarantee the security of everyone, regardless of whether they are Muslims, Christians or Jews".
"Our efforts to lay the groundwork for an international peace conference continue," he said.

Why did Yemen's Houthis launch attack on Israel. Will it help Gaza?

November 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Houthi movement in Yemen shot down a United States drone on Wednesday night, more than a week after effectively declaring war on Israel, raising fears of a regional escalation.
The   by the Iran-linked group, which controls vast swaths of Yemen, comes as Tel Aviv continues to bomb the Gaza Strip, killing more than 10,500 Palestinians, more than 4,300 of them children.
The Yemeni group has launched three rounds of attacks on Israel since the October 7 Hamas attack that killed at least 1,405 Israelis.
So, what have the Houthi attacks - and the response - looked like so far, where does Iran fit in, and where could things go from here?
What has happened so far?
Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the Houthis, announced on October 31 that the movement launched a 'large number' of rockets, ballistic missiles and drones towards Israel.
More strikes would follow 'until the Israeli aggression stops' and Palestinians are "victorious", he said.
None of the projectiles, which were fired at the Red Sea tourist resort of Eilat, are believed to have reached Israel, either having been destroyed by defence systems or falling short.
Israel said it destroyed a drone over the Red Sea. For the first time since the outbreak of the war with Hamas, Israel used its 'Arrow' defence system which is designed to take out ballistic missiles outside of the Earth's atmosphere, according to its military.
On October 27, drones had caused explosions in two Egyptian Red Sea towns, which are located near the Israeli border. Tel Aviv had said at the time that the Houthis had launched drones and missiles intended for Israel.
The United States military had said in late October that a navy warship in the northern Red Sea intercepted projectiles launched by the Houthis, potentially towards Israel.
Is this the 'new front' Iran warned about?
As Israeli strikes continue to pound Gaza and kill civilians, Iran has repeatedly warned that if they don't stop,   by the 'resistance axis' – a network of political and armed groups aligned to Iran.
Tehran backs the Houthis in Yemen, Shia armed groups in Iraq, the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon and various Palestinian factions.
Iran, however, has consistently maintained that members of the axis act on their own accord - as Hamas did on October 7.
The Houthi movement, also known as Ansarallah, has been in control of large parts of Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, since late 2014. For the past nine years, the group has been at war with an internationally recognised Yemeni government that was backed by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia.
The fighting in Yemen has decreased markedly in recent months as   in the wake of Iran and Saudi Arabia restoring diplomatic relations earlier this year.
The Houthis' entry into the war with Hamas could be concerning for Israel as it is already engaged in border fighting with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.
Skirmishes between the two have only gradually intensified, and Hezbollah has been   as the two hit deeper into each other's territories.
Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah did not fully commit the group to the war in a highly anticipated speech on Friday but said that remains a real possibility depending on what Israel and its Western allies do next.
In a rare announcement on Monday, the US said it has brought an Ohio-class submarine to the region but did not disclose the name or the exact location.
Did the Houthis go all-in?
The Houthis, who have a history of proudly displaying their latest military achievements and had a major parade in late September, released a video of launching many missiles and drones after their initial announcement.
Shouts of 'death to Israel' and 'death to America' can be heard as ballistic missiles are launched into the atmosphere.

- Aurora Intel (@AuroraIntel) November 1, 2023
It is unclear whether all the footage released is new. But the footage appeared to show that the Houthis used a variant of their Zolfaghar mid-range ballistic missile, the Quds cruise missile and the Samad drone.
They are all based on similar Iranian models, which are known by different names. There is no reliable information on exactly which variants were used or what their true ranges are, but some of the Houthi projectiles may theoretically have the capability of reaching Israel.
What the Houthis did not use was the purportedly more superior ballistic missile known as the Toofan, which they recently unveiled and has a longer range.
They also possess so-called suicide drones, including one believed to be based on the  , which the West says has been extensively used by Russia in the war in Ukraine despite Tehran maintaining the supply to Moscow was not meant for the war.
So, it appears that the Houthis have yet to fully delve into their varied arsenal of projectiles, which also includes a host of anti-ship missiles.
Thomas Juneau, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa's Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, told Al Jazeera that the Houthis are unlikely to become full participants in this war, not least of all because they are roughly 2,000 kilometres (1,240 miles) away from Israel.
He said if the conflict escalates into a regional war and Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups fully join in, the Houthis will most likely keep launching missiles and drones at Israel. But the situation could be different then.
"If the Houthis attack Israel with drones and missiles on their own, Israeli air defences can most likely intercept them. If, however, the Houthis join multiple other Iran-backed groups - Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, possibly various militias in Syria - in attacking Israel simultaneously, then there is a higher chance that Israeli air defences could be overwhelmed. Such a multi-front war is the nightmare scenario for Israel."
How could Israel respond?
The Israeli military said last week it has deployed missile boats in the Red Sea as reinforcements. And it has the full backing of a host of US warships in the region, which could protect its southern coasts.
Tzachi Hanegbi, the Israeli national security adviser, said the Houthi attacks were 'intolerable' but declined to elaborate on what exactly an Israeli response might look like.
Just as some of the Houthi missiles appear to have fallen short of their marks due to the relatively long distance between Yemen and Israel, it could also be potentially costly and complicated for Israel to respond with sustained aerial strikes.
Social media reveal the wreckage of a #Houthi #Quds  cruise missile in the southern region of #Mudawwara , Ma'an, #Jordan , approximately 1,500 km away from #Yemen . #Houthis  have been dropping hints about targeting the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center in #Dimona , #Israel pic.twitter.com/y1JifYoUZk
- Basha باشا (@BashaReport) October 31, 2023
For now, it appears Tel Aviv wants to make sure its southern coasts are protected. The deployment of the missile boats could also indicate that Israel may be concerned about the possibility of Houthi attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea.
Juneau, from the University of Ottawa, said Israel currently has little to gain by attacking the Houthis, as it could risk an escalation that it wishes to avoid.
"In addition, the Houthis have emerged more powerful from years of air strikes by Saudi Arabia; beyond sending a message, it would be difficult for Israeli retaliation to hurt the Houthis," he said.
For years, Western officials and a number of Arab counterparts have accused Iran of providing arms, combat training and funding for the Houthis, which it denies. Tehran, however, publicly backs the Houthi movement as a member of the axis which supports Palestinians.
Juneau said the Palestinian cause is important to the Houthis, as they have at least partly built their reputation by opposing Israel and the US, but the movement's status as an increasingly important member of the Iran-backed resistance axis matters more for the current war.
"By sending missile and drone strikes against Israel, the Houthis are aiming to send a message of support for Hamas and a signal to Israel that it can now reach it, and that they will not hesitate to use this capability in the future," he said.

Biden seeks to expand Israeli access to US weapons stockpile

The White House aims to lift nearly all restrictions on Israel's access to weapons from a crucial US stockpile, enabling a smoother weapons pipeline to Israel, which has paused weeks of its devastating bombing of the Gaza Strip.
The White House asked the United States Senate to scrap the restrictions in its latest supplementary budget request on October 20. If granted, the request would enable Israel to access more high-powered US weapons at a reduced cost, with less congressional oversight.
The request proposes changes to policies governing the War Reserve Stockpile Allies-Israel (WRSA-I), an Israel-based US weapons stockpile that has smart bombs, missiles, military vehicles, and other ammunition and equipment.
The stockpile, set up in the 1980s, gives the Pentagon a strong weapons cache to tap into in the event of regional conflicts.
Israel, the US's principal ally in the Middle East, has also been able to pull some weapons from the reserve in emergency cases and buy them at a reduced cost. However, it has been able to access only certain classes of weapons deemed 'obsolete or surplus'.
The White House's request would eliminate such conditions, enabling the US to transfer all 'defence articles' from its stockpile to Israel. It would also waive a yearly limit on the amount Washington spends refilling the cache, and curb congressional oversight on the transfers.
'Free-flowing pipeline'
Josh Paul, a former director in the Department of State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, told The Intercept  the request 'would essentially create a free-flowing pipeline to provide any defense articles to Israel by the simple act of placing them in the WRSA-I stockpile, or other stockpiles intended for Israel'.
Worth $3.8bn per year, the US already sends more military aid to Israel than any other country.
Since Israel's military assault on Gaza on October 7, the US has moved to up this number, with the House of Representatives approving a $14.3bn emergency military aid package to Israel.
However, there are signs that the   support for military aid to Israel is waning amid the Gaza war, in which Israeli attacks have killed nearly 15,000 Palestinians, including 6,000 children.
According to a November poll by Reuters/Ipsos , just 33 percent of US respondents now believe Washington should back Israel in the war, as opposed to being a 'neutral mediator' or backing the Palestinians.
At the same time, only 31 percent of US respondents support sending Israel weapons, compared with 43 percent who oppose.
Meanwhile, aid to Ukraine has been delayed due to opposition from Republican lawmakers.

Turkey's Erdogan scraps Israel trip over 'inhumane' Gaza war

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called off a planned visit to Israel over its 'inhumane' war in Gaza, saying relations between the two states would not improve.
"We had a project to go to Israel, but it was cancelled; we will not go," Erdogan told governing party lawmakers in parliament on Wednesday as he lambasted Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza and defended Hamas.
The Turkish leader's biting remarks extend a deterioration in ties between Ankara and Israel, which have had a rocky, back-and-forth relationship for years.
Once tight regional allies, Turkey froze links with Israel in 2010, after Israeli military forces carried out a   heading to Gaza with aid supplies, killing 10 civilians.
While the two states restored ties in 2016, Turkey again   in 2018 over Israel's deadly crackdown on   at Gaza's border.
Relations 'might have been different'
Erdogan's tirade appeared set to put relations back in the deep freeze once more after recent signs suggesting ties were building back up.
Erdogan met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in person for the first time  last month at a UN summit in New York. There, the two leaders opened the door to potential cooperation in areas such as energy, technology, and cybersecurity.
However, as Israeli bombs   for a third week, killing more than 6,500 people and wrecking much of the territory's infrastructure, the Turkish leader is again pulling few punches.
'Of course, we had good intentions, but [Netanyahu] abused them," said Erdogan. 'If he had continued with good intentions, our relations might have been different, but now, unfortunately, this will not happen either."
Erdogan, who has led Turkey for two decades, is a vocal advocate of the Palestinian cause. He has directed fierce criticism at Israel since a deadly   in the besieged Gaza Strip on October 17.
"The international community is not rising to the challenge in the face of the Israeli regime's unlawful and unrestrained attacks against civilians," Erdogan said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that the people of Gaza are suffering from 'collective punishment'.
In his Wednesday address to parliament, the Turkish president also praised   as 'liberators' who are fighting to 'protect their lands and people'.
Hamas fighters broke out of the besieged Gaza Strip on October 7 and attacked Israelis, including many civilians, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 220 captives, according to Israeli officials.
Erdogan is expected to attend  a mass pro-Palestinian rally in Istanbul on Saturday organised by the governing Justice and Development Party.

'We will never be safe': A day of bombing in Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp

Amid intense bombardment at noon (9:00 GMT) on Monday, Israeli missiles landed on the   just north of Gaza City, unleashing   on those who live there.
Asmaa Tayeh, a young writer who lives in the camp, had grown accustomed to the sound of missiles in surrounding area since a surprise attack on Saturday prompted   on Hamas.
But she did not expect the place she calls home to be the target of a strike. When bombs started to fall on Jabalia, she 'could hardly keep herself calm', she told Al Jazeera, her voice trembling from the shock.
'This time was actually the closest to my house and the loudest,' she said. 'For a moment I thought it was our neighbour's house that was hit.'
The violence of the explosion shook the entire camp,sending Tayeh rushing to the window to check how close the strike was and whether her home had suffered any damage.
'I was laying on my bed and writing to an outside friend who had texted to check up on me,' Tayeh said. 'All I could say to him after the crazy raids was: Thank God I'm still alive.'

However, while the immediate consequences of the strikes were not immediatelyobvious to her, they would soon become all too clear.
As news reports trickled in, Tayeh and her neighbours learned that the centre of Jabalia's bustling market had borne the brunt of the attack. 'The air strike hit,' Tayeh said, 'and we found out that dozens of people were killed.'
In the wake of the bomb blasts, emergency vehicles raced to the market, flooding the air with the wail of sirens.
"Sounds of ambulances and cars filled the area," Tayehrecalled. But even more piercing were the voices of 'people screaming and rushing to the bombing area'.
In such a small community, where everyone knows everyone else, any loss of life can lead to collective heartbreak. But Tayeh has had little chance to mourn. The bombing pushed her to action.
'That's when I rushed to prepare my bags to leave, in case we had to,' Tayeh explained. 'Death seems to be closer, but I can do nothing about it, just like the people who were killed only minutes ago.'
Not only is the camp densely populated, but it is also home to   run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) — facilities that have been converted into shelters for hundreds of displaced families.
The tight quarters in the camp contributed to the death toll during the aerial bombardment.
Though Tayeh and her family escaped injury during the strike, any sense of security they had has been shattered. Tayeh finds herself fixated on the news, constantly checking lists of the dead and injured for the names of her friends and family.
"Luckily, we are still fine and staying in our house, but we don't feel safe at all, just like everyone else in Gaza," she toldAl Jazeera.
That sense of danger will extend beyond the present-day conflict, she added.
"For me," she said, "I believe we will never be safe even after the war is over. In fact, I will never feel free as long as Palestine is occupied and its people terrorised."
Tayeh's sentiments resonate with countless Palestinians who have endured decades of conflict and occupation.
In the shadow of the current devastation, they hold onto their resilience, their hope for a brighter future and their unwavering belief in the right to live in peace on their ancestral land.
No clear resolution is yet in sight.

Gaza needed billions in aid before Israel-Hamas war: UN

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza already needed billions of dollars in international aid to compensate for years of Israeli blockade before the Israel-Hamas war broke out,a United Nations report states.
In its report  on the economic development of the occupied Palestinian territory for 2022 released on Wednesday, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said that conditions in the enclave had been "stifled" by years of restrictions before October 7.
'Donors and the international community need to extend significant economic aid to repair the extensive damage Gaza has experienced under prolonged restrictions and closures and frequent military operations, which has stifled the economy and decimated infrastructure,' the report found.
'While donor aid is important to assist the people of Gaza, it should not be viewed as a substitute for ending the restrictions and closures and calling on Israel and all parties to bear their responsibilities under international law,' UNCTAD states.
(Al Jazeera)
Speaking to reporters in Geneva, Richard Kozul-Wright, director of UNCTAD's division on globalisation and development strategies, said it was difficult to assess how much help Gaza would now need until the conflict stops.
'But it's going to be in the billions of dollars,' he warned.
In Gaza, gross domestic product was 11.7 percent below the 2019 level and close to its lowest since 1994, the report found.
There was also a decline in aid between 2008 and 2022, from $2bn, or 27 percent of GDP, to $500m, or less than 3 percent of GDP, last year.
The report also found that nearly 50 percent of Gaza's population is unemployed, and more than half live in poverty.

Although workers in Gaza have been allowed access to the job market in Israel, the number of permits issued, accounting for about 1 percent of employed workers, is too small to counter poverty.
'Border closures and repeated military operations have set in motion a vicious circle of economic and institutional collapse that has rendered Gaza a case of "development in reverse,' the report added.
'The impact is not confined to the short term. Indirect and long-term effects will reverberate through future generations,' UNCTAD summed up.

Israel raids Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital for second day

Israeli forces have raided Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital for a second day, entering the medical complex from the southern part.
"The situation at al-Shifa Hospital is indeed very dire," said Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Thursday morning.
The facility houses thousands of patients, medical staff and displaced Palestinians who witnesses said are not being allowed to leave.
"Israeli bulldozers and tanks have reportedly advanced inside the hospital complex, damaging the wall of the facility. Doctors and other medical workers were also being reportedly interrogated," Abu Azzoum said.
Israeli tanks and troops first entered the al-Shifa compound on   morning in what they called a "targeted" operation, after encircling and bombarding the facility for days.
Israel claims al-Shifa is being used as a command centre of Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, but has not produced evidence to support these assertions.
Hamas rejects the accusations and has invited the United Nations to send investigators to verify the truth.
"It is a civilian hospital. There is no member of Hamas in al-Shifa Hospital," Mohammed Zaqout, the director-general of hospitals in the Gaza Strip, told Al Jazeera. "There is no military activity in al-Shifa. All that happened is around the hospital but inside the hospital, all of the people are civilians."
'Blindfolded and interrogated'
Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis, said more than 24 hours after Israeli troops first raided the compound, they have "failed to produce any evidence" that links the hospital to Hamas.
"Unfortunately, this failure in confirming just resulted in causing massive destruction in the hospital and renewed attacks on its building and redeploying troops at the gates of the hospital from all sides," he added.
The specialised surgeries building was damaged from the inside, Israeli soldiers blew up a warehouse for medicine and medical equipment inside the hospital, and witnesses reported "about 200 people being blindfolded and interrogated and taken to unknown areas", Mahmoud reported.
"All of this is happening under heavy cover of air strikes and tank shells around al-Shifa hospital and Gaza centre."
Mustafa Barghouti, the general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, described the Israeli invasion of al-Shifa as "the mother of all scandals" and questioned why the Israeli army has said it needs to occupy the hospitals "for days" to find evidence.
"In the process, they've endangered the lives of hospital patients [and] hospital staff," Barghouti told Al Jazeera from Ramallah.
Humanitarian pause
The United States has continued to push the Israeli narrative that al-Shifa is used as a "military headquarters" by Hamas, but it   giving Israel a green light for a raid. President Joe Biden also asked Israel to be "incredibly careful" in its operation in al-Shifa.
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling for   in Gaza on Wednesday evening, but Israel rejected it.
Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador to the UN, said the resolution would have "no meaning", calling it "disconnected from reality".
On Thursday, Israel's army said it carried out an air strike on the house of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Gaza, as it "often served as a meeting point for Hamas's senior leaders to direct terror attacks against Israeli civilians" and Israeli soldiers.
Deaths were reported across the Strip overnight as Israeli forces struck other locations in north and central Gaza, including two residential buildings in Nuseirat refugee camp.
The UN has said there is only one hospital left in northern Gaza with the capacity to accept patients.
Israel's attacks on Gaza are continuing for the 41st consecutive day, after Hamas fighters entered Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people. Since then, Israel has killed more than 11,300 Palestinians in Gaza.

Defying bone-crushing exhaustion, Gaza's doctors work despite Israel's war

Gaza Strip – Khalil al-Degran has not gone home for 12 days, working non-stop in the accident and emergency department at the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, the central Gaza Strip.
"We get dozens of wounded people at a time, which is overwhelming," he said. "All the hospital's beds are full, so we've resorted to treating the injured on the floor or in the courtyard."
Israel began bombing the besieged territory on October 7, after a surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli military bases and towns near the Strip killed 1,400.
Since then, more than 4,200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air attacks, and 12,000 others wounded. At least 1,524 of the dead are children, with one child being killed every 15 minutes.
Al-Degran's family comes to see him at the hospital sometimes, but he says many other doctors and nurses have been unable to go home for days on end.
Not only are all the still operational hospitals in the Gaza Strip frantically busy, but they also have a severe shortage of medicines and supplies, and both electricity and water are scarce after Israel cut off fuel supplies that kept the power and desalination plants running.
On Thursday, the director of al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, Iyad al-Jabri, said the hospital's "strategic stock of medicines and medical supplies is gone" and that there was a staff shortage.
"There is not enough equipment in the operating room or intensive care," al-Degran said. "We have patients with serious injuries, but we cannot treat them properly."
Patients cannot be transferred to other hospitals, because they also are also at breaking point.
Last Friday, the World Health Organization  , pointing out that each lost hour puts "more lives at risk'.

'Tightening the noose on Palestinians'
Gaza has about 30 hospitals, 13 of them operated by the health ministry and others privately run.
Israel has warned 24 hospitals to evacuate, including the largest one, al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
Gaza's health ministry said four hospitals – Beit Hanoun, Hamad, Karama and Durrah – are out of service after being bombed by Israel, while 25 others have sustained damage from the bombings.
"The Israeli strikes have led to the death of 44 and the injury of 70 medical personnel," said health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra on Thursday. He earlier said 14 health facilities had stopped operating after running out of fuel for their power generators.
'All the remaining facilities are operating at 150 percent capacity," al-Qudra said. "As a result, we've been forced to carry out surgical operations on the floor. We've totally run of out fuel, medical supplies and medicine across all hospitals in Gaza. We are expecting the number of fatalities to rise.'
According to Dr Muhammad Zaqout, the general director of hospitals in the Gaza Strip, the facilities were already suffering a major shortage of medical supplies, amounting to 40 percent of requirements, before October 7.

"During this war, 70 percent of the medical supplies and medicines have already been consumed," he said. "What we usually use in one month we have used in one day due to the number of cases.
"The Israeli occupation is tightening its noose on Palestinians here by closing the crossings," Zaqout said. "Rafah is the only crossing where lifesaving medical supplies can get in," he added, referring to the land crossing between Gaza and Egypt that Israel has bombed several times during its assault.
Defying Israeli military orders to evacuate and repeating that bombing hospitals is a crime against humanity, doctors in Gaza have taken a firm stance and refused to leave their patients behind.
"Everyone is determined that they will not evacuate," al-Dergan said. "It's not even possible. How can we transfer patients in intensive care or those undergoing surgery? If the Israelis want to bomb the hospitals then it will be over our heads as we stand by our patients."
The WHO has called Israel's evacuation orders a "death sentence" for the sick and injured.
"Overwhelmingly, caregivers have chosen to stay behind and honour their oaths as health professionals to 'do no harm', rather than risk moving their critically ill patients during evacuations," the WHO said in a statement .
"Health workers should never have to make such impossible choices."
Finding your own family among the casualties
One of the most difficult situations that doctors experience during times of crisis is discovering family members among those injured or killed.
This is what happened to Dr Fadi al-Khoudari at the al-Shifa Hospital on Monday  when he found his brother and father among those killed in an Israeli attack in Gaza City.
The doctor collapsed on the floor in shock, crying out as the doctors around him tried to console him.
This scene was repeated the same day for Dr Hamid Abu Musa at Nasser Medical when he discovered that his son had been killed as the result of an Israeli warplane targeting his house west of the southern city of Khan Younis.
Zaqout, the general director of hospitals, said medical staff are close to exhaustion due to the relentless Israeli air strikes and the hundreds of casualties arriving in hospitals every day.
"The continuation of the indiscriminate bombing of the Gaza Strip will not only exhaust the medical teams, but it will also prevent them from being able to work and deal with treating the wounded," he said.
In addition to physical exhaustion, other factors are preventing medical staff from providing care and services to the wounded, he added, such as the trauma of learning of the death of family members, the bombing of some of their homes and the displacement of their families.

'More than we can handle'
"No doctor can bear to see the severed body parts of children," al-Degran said. "Is it reasonable for us to have to pick up their remains in this way – a decapitated head, a severed hand … It hurts my heart very much."
He added that he struggles when hearing the screams of injured children, men and women, shell-shocked and covered in blood, "thinking they were safe in their homes before a missile dropped over their heads".
"What we are experiencing as doctors in hospitals is a million times more than we can handle," al-Degran said. He called on the world to stand with Gaza and "not forsake it".
"There is no electricity or water in the hospitals, and we rely on using generators in the operating room, intensive care and nursery, in addition to the dialysis room," he said.
"Stop this war on Gaza, where entire families have already been wiped off the civil registry. This death and destruction is enough.'

More than 19,000 displaced in Lebanon as Israel border clashes escalate: UN

October 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
More than 19,000 people have been internally displaced in Lebanon since early October, according to the United Nations migration agency, amid soaring tensions near the Israel-Lebanon border after the Israel-Hamas war erupted.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said 19,646 people had been displaced inside Lebanon since it began tracking movements on October 8, the day after an assault on Israel by Hamas fighters and an Israeli offensive on the besieged Gaza Strip.
It said the movements were mostly by those fleeing the south of Lebanon, while some people have also moved from other areas.
'We expect the numbers to rise as the cross-border tensions continue,' IOM spokesperson Mohammed Ali Abunajela said in a statement, as cited by the AFP news agency.
At least 1,400 people were killed in the  , most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel has since bombarded Gaza relentlessly, killing more than 5,000 people, mostly civilians, according to Palestinian authorities.
As Israel escalated its Gaza offensive, the Iran-backed Hezbollah group, which is based in southern Lebanon, has increased its attacks on Israeli targets.
Israel has carried out cross-border strikes and bombardments on Lebanon, while Palestinian groups have also launched limited infiltration attempts into Israel.
Several communities have been told to evacuate in Israel, while thousands of people in Lebanon have fled border towns to other parts of the south or to areas closer to the capital Beirut.

Abunajela said the movement of people is not helping an already 'deteriorating' situation in the country.
'Amidst a deteriorating economic situation and the significant rise in poverty across all populations in Lebanon, internal displacements may add additional stress to the resources of host communities,' he said.
Many who have fled south Lebanon have moved north to the coastal city of Tyre, which is 18km (11 miles) from the border.
Inaya Ezzeddine, a lawmaker from Tyre, said the movement was putting a strain on families hosting the displaced and the government of a country struggling with an economic crisis.
"This war is happening amid a very big economic crisis and people don't have provisions," Ezzeddine told the Reuters news agency, adding that around 6,000 people had sought refuge in Tyre and three schools had been used to shelter some of them.
"We cannot open all schools because schools are still operating. Every school we open [for the displaced], we're depriving its pupils from using it," she added.
Fears of escalation
The soaring tensions on the Israel-Lebanon border have raised fears that armed groups could potentially join the war in support of Hamas. Analysts have warned that Hezbollah could escalate its involvement if Israel launches a ground invasion of Gaza.
Hezbollah says 27 of its fighters have been killed in the clashes since October 7. Lebanese security sources say 11 fighters from Palestinian groups in Lebanon, which are allied to Hezbollah, have also been killed, according to the Reuters news agency.
Israel's military says seven troops have been killed along the border area.

Social media platforms swamped with fake news on the Israel-Hamas war

Hours after  , the armed Palestinian group, attacked Israel on Saturday, X, the social network owned by the world's richest man Elon Musk was awash with fake videos, photos and misleading information about the conflict.
'Imagine if this was happening in our neighbourhood, to your family,' posted Ian Miles Cheong, a far-right commentator whom Musk interacts with often, along with a video that he claimed showed Palestinian fighters killing Israeli citizens.
A Community Note, an X feature that lets users add context to posts, stated that the people in the clip were members of Israeli law enforcement, not Hamas.
But the video is still up and has racked up millions of impressions. And hundreds of other X accounts have shared the clip on the platform, some of them with verified check marks, an Al Jazeera search showed.
Disinformation – fake news that is spread deliberately – about the war and the Israel-Palestine conflict in general spread across other social networks like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok too, but thanks to Musk's revamped policies that let anyone pay to be verified as well as large scale layoffs in X's Trust and Safety teams, the platform saw the worst of it.
X, Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, TikTok, and BlueSky, did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment.
On Monday, X declared there were more than 50 million posts on the platform over the weekend about the conflict.
In response, the company said it had removed newly-created accounts affiliated with Hamas, escalated 'tens of thousands of posts' for sharing graphic media and hate speech, and updated its policies that define what the platform considers 'newsworthy".
'These massive companies are still stumped by the proliferation of disinformation, even as no one is still surprised by it,' said Irina Raicu, the director of the Internet Ethics Program at Santa Clara University.
'They put out numbers - how many posts they've taken down, how many accounts they've blocked, what settings you might want to change if you don't want to see carnage. What they don't put out are their metrics of their failures: how many distortions were not accompanied by 'Community Notes' or otherwise labelled, and for how long. It's left to the journalists and researchers to document their failures after they happen.'
'Old and recycled footage'
Over the last few years, bad actors have repeatedly used social media platforms to spread disinformation in response to real-world conflicts. In 2019, for instance, Twitter and Facebook were flooded with rumours and hoaxes after India and Pakistan, two nuclear powers, came to the brink of war following Pakistan's shooting down of two Indian warplanes and its capture of an Indian pilot.
This week, on X, a user called The Indian Muslim shared a video with the caption 'More power to you #Hamas' and claimed that the clip showed a Hamas armed fighter firing a large, shoulder-mounted rocket cannon and taking down an Israeli helicopter.
Multiple disinformation researchers, both on social media and in interviews with Al Jazeera, pointed out that the footage was from a video game called Arma 3. The post, which has Community Notes on it, is still up and has more than half a million views.
Another post by Jim Ferguson, a British social media influencer, claims to show Hamas soldiers using US weapons 'left behind in Afghanistan used to attack Israel".
But according to Community Notes, the photo shows Taliban soldiers from 2021, not Hamas. Fergusson's post, which is still available on the platform, has more than 10 million views.
Dina Sadek, a Middle East research fellow at the Atlantic Council's DFRLab, told Al Jazeera that another false narrative her team had seen spreading on platforms was that Hamas had received help from inside Israel to plan the attack.
'There's old and recycled footage circulating online that is overwhelming and makes it difficult for users to discern what is real and what is not,' Sadek said.
Disinformation around the attack is also travelling between platforms, Sadek added. 'Some TikTok videos find their way to X, and some footage that appeared on Telegram first is then seen on X,' she said.
'The flood of grifters spreading lies and hate about the Israel-Gaza crisis in recent days, combined with algorithms that aggressively promote extreme and disturbing content, is exactly why social media has become such a bad place to access reliable information,' Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, told Al Jazeera.
'Tech companies have proven themselves uninterested, if not utterly complicit, in the spread of dangerous propaganda.'

Hollywood stars urge Biden to push for ceasefire in Israel-Hamas war

October 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Hollywood A-listers including Joaquin Phoenix, Cate Blanchett and Susan Sarandon have urged US President Joe Biden to call for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas.
In a letter released on Friday, dozens of entertainment figures called on Biden to facilitate an end to the bombing of Gaza and the release of all captives held by Hamas.
'We ask that, as President of the United States, you call for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza and Israel before another life is lost,' the celebrities wrote in the letter organised by artists4ceasefire.org.
'More than 5,000 people have been killed in the last week and a half - a number any person of conscience knows is catastrophic. We believe all life is sacred, no matter faith or ethnicity and we condemn the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians.'
"We urge your administration, and all world leaders, to honour all of the lives in the Holy Land and call for and facilitate a ceasefire without delay - an end to the bombing of Gaza, and the safe release of hostages," the letter added.
"Saving lives is a moral imperative."
The more than 70 signatories include Jessica Chastain, Kristen Stewart, Jeremy Strong, Mark Ruffalo, and Quinta Brunson, among others.
Israel pledged to eradicate Hamas after the armed group carried out the deadliest attacks on the country in decades, and has bombarded Gaza with air strikes ahead of an expected ground offensive.
Israeli strikes on the enclave have so far killed at least 4,130 people, according to Palestinian officials.
More than 1,400 people were killed and about 200 people taken captive in Hamas's multi-pronged attacks inside Israel on October 7, according to Israeli officials.
Biden has backed Israel in its war against Hamas, while pressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and minimise civilian casualties.
Oxfam and United Nations agencies have warned that Gaza is facing a humanitarian catastrophe amid a growing risk of cholera and other deadly infectious diseases due to the   services.
Israel cut water, fuel and electricity to Gaza after announcing a total blockade of the Palestinian enclave.
On Friday, Biden said the first trucks carrying aid to Gaza from Egypt would arrive in the next 24 to 48 hours after he earlier reached a deal with Netanyahu to allow food, water and medical supplies into the enclave.

Hamas armed wing says it fired 16 rockets at Israel from southern Lebanon

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The armed wing of the Palestinian group Hamas has said that it fired a barrage of rockets at Israel from southern Lebanon in response to Israeli strikes on Gaza.
In a statement on Telegram on Monday, the Lebanon branch of Hamas's   said that it had launched 16 rockets targeting the northern Israeli city of Nahariya and the southern outskirts of the city of Haifa. Israel said that it had identified about 30 launches from Lebanon over an hour.
The group said that the rockets were in retaliation for 'massacres and its aggression against our people in Gaza', where Palestinian authorities say that   have killed more than 10,000 people since fighting began on October 7 after a Hamas attack on southern Israel that Israeli authorities say killed more than 1,400 people.
While Gaza has been at the centre of the attacks so far, tensions have   on Israel's  , where several armed groups, including the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah, have exchanged limited fire with Israeli forces for nearly a month.
Such cross-border exchanges have killed at least 81 people in Lebanon, including 59 Hezbollah fighters, and six soldiers and two civilians on the Israeli side, according to a tally from the AFP news agency.
The Qassam Brigades did not give further details in its statement, but firing rockets towards Haifa is the furthest targeting from Lebanon since clashes began along the border.
Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera correspondent Zeina Khodr said that an Israeli   on Sunday had killed three children and their grandmother. Hezbollah said it responded by firing rockets at the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, killing an Israeli civilian.
'On Friday the [Hezbollah] secretary-general   promised that any civilian killed in Lebanon will be responded [to] with an attack in Israel killing a civilian. So he established, if you like, that equation,' said Khodr.
Analysts have expressed concern that Israel's war on Gaza could trigger a wider regional escalation, with Hezbollah and other armed groups supported by Iran joining the fight against Israel as   in Gaza reach their breaking point.
So far, both sides have   the kind of steps that could trigger a larger confrontation, opting instead for a steady campaign of tit-for-tat shelling and missile strikes.
'Both sides really understand the consequences of expanding the conflict in southern Lebanon,' said Khodr.

What do we know about Israeli captives taken by Hamas and their release?

More than 200 people are believed to be held captive by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza after the deadly attacks inside Israel on October 7.
Hamas said the attacks, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis, were aimed at ending 'Israeli violations' at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, Islam's third holiest site, and to secure the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons.
Since then, Israel has been pounding Gaza with nonstop aerial strikes, killing about 5,800 people, including 2,360 children, and has been preparing for a ground offensive.
So what do we know about the captives, and how many of them have been released? What are the chances for the release of the others? What do we know about Israel's planned offensive?
Who are they?
The latest figure given by Israel's military on Monday was 222 people, including military personnel, were being held captive in the besieged enclave.
Hamas has said more than 20 captives have been killed by Israeli air strikes.
'The murdered and the missing come from over 30 countries, including the United Kingdom,' British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told lawmakers this month.
We don't have all the details about the captives yet, but officials from different countries have provided some information.
Israeli authorities have not publicly named the captives so far, but a considerable number are believed to be military officers. Some are believed to be children and the elderly.
At least 10 United States citizens are still unaccounted for and are believed to be held in Gaza, according to officials. Two US nationals were released on Friday after Qatari mediation.
Thailand believes it has 17 nationals among the captives, and at least eight are Germans.
Seven British nationals and seven French citizens are still classified as missing, and some are believed to be held captive. Argentina and the Netherlands have also said they have citizens held in Gaza.

Who has been released?
Four people held in Gaza have so far been released by Hamas, keeping hopes alive that others may also be freed.
On Friday, a mother and daughter from Chicago who also hold Israeli citizenship were released.
Natalie Raanan, 17, and her mother, Judith, 59, were transferred to Egypt through the Rafah crossing with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They met with Israeli security forces in Egypt and were transferred to a military base in Israel to be reunited with their family.
We facilitated the release of 2 more hostages, transporting them out of #Gaza  this evening.
Our role as a neutral intermediary makes this work possible & we are ready to facilitate any future release.
We hope that they will soon be back with their loved ones.
- ICRC (@ICRC) October 23, 2023
Qatari and Egyptian mediation led to the release of two elderly Israeli women late on Monday. Yokheved Lifshitz and Nurit Yitzhak, also known as Nurit Cooper, were released on 'humanitarian' grounds, according to Hamas.
The 85-year-old Lifshitz said at a news conference on Tuesday that she was hurt during the abduction but was treated well during captivity. Both women's husbands remain captives.
Hamas has claimed it treats the captives as 'guests'.
Will others be freed?
Hamas has said it wanted to release some of the captives without conditions but   the offer. Tel Aviv has denied this claim.
Israeli media have reported that Hamas may be on the verge of releasing more than 50 captives as advanced talks are held with Israel, which had said as it ramped up its bombing campaign that it would not talk with the 'terrorist' organisation.
Reports have indicated Hamas has demanded Israel allow fuel into Gaza, a request also made by human rights organisations as   for thousands of wounded Palestinians.
Al Jazeera, however, could not confirm the veracity of the Israeli media reports.
In addition to Qatar and Egypt, Turkey may also emerge as a mediator after its foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said the US and several European countries have asked for help.
In addition to talking to their governments, families have taken to social media to plead for help. There have also been rallies in several countries during which demonstrators have called for the captives' release.
The US has sent a small special operations team to help the Israeli military, but any rescue operation would be risky.
Israelis and Palestinians have a history of taking captives, and   to 10,000 since the Hamas attacks this month.
The most high-profile case of a prisoner exchange took place in 2011 when Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was taken five years earlier, was swapped for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners.
What about the ground offensive?
Israel, which has been amassing troops and equipment on the Gaza border, said on Tuesday that a plan for a ground assault is still very much on the agenda and its military is ready to launch it  .
However, reports indicated that US President Joe Biden has asked Israel to hold off on the attack until the captives are released, saying there is "no higher priority" at the moment.
Meanwhile, The New York Times reported on Monday that US officials are not confident the Israeli military is ready for a ground invasion and cannot hope for tangible results.
The US-based news outlet Axios on Tuesday quoted two unnamed Israeli officials as saying they are willing to delay the ground offensive for a few days to allow for more talks on the captives.
Experts have said a ground offensive would carry high risks for the captives because there is no exact information on where they are being held and as many of them are believed to be held in a large network of underground tunnels beneath Gaza.
Much of northern Gaza has been levelled by Israeli bombing, and a ground war is expected to be difficult and unforgiving.

'Son of Maryam', a birth seen as a victory against Israel's raids on Gaza

Gaza City – In the neonatal intensive care unit of al-Shifa Hospital, a premature baby with a full head of thick black hair lies on his back in an incubator, his diaper nearly eclipsing his tiny body. A pink plastic tag around one minuscule ankle identifies him only as "Son of Maryam al-Harsh".
The 10-day-old baby is, according to the neonatal unit head Dr Nasser Bulbul, a symbol of "victory against this ugly Israeli aggression".
"On October 13, we got a call from the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza about a badly injured pregnant woman who was taking her last breaths," Bulbul said. "There was an air attack on her home, and her entire family, all 10 members including her husband, were killed."
An emergency caesarean section was performed on the dying woman, who was 32 weeks pregnant, and her baby boy was pulled out of her womb, alive and with a faint heartbeat.
The baby was transferred to al-Shifa, where he was immediately put on mechanical ventilation, along with 54 premature infants.
"He is recovering," Bulbul said. "We took him off mechanical ventilation after six days, and three days later, we can see that he has cerebral ischemia, which is an acute brain injury that results from impaired blood flow to the brain. This is the result of his mother dying before he was born."
No relative has come to claim the baby, but Bulbul and his team of nurses all take care of him.
"Every time I check up on him, I'm gripped with sadness and pain," the doctor said, pointing to the traumatic event that ushered in the birth of the boy.
"But as long as he is alive, he gives us strength and hope that we shall overcome these terrible days. Even patience to endure the horrors we see on a daily basis."

Israel launched its latest offensive on the Gaza Strip on October 7 in revenge for an attack on Israel by the armed wing of Hamas that same day.
The air bombardment of Gaza has continued relentlessly and Israel imposed a total siege on it, cutting off water, electricity and fuel from the sole power plant.
Doctors have warned of the devastating consequences of such actions, saying that hundreds of patients who rely on respiratory machines will die. Fuel in hospitals has run out, and while some were forced to shut down, others like al-Shifa have been running on solar-powered generators.
With the Gaza Strip's healthcare system on the brink of collapse, it is hard to know whether the besieged territory's 130 premature babies in the enclave's seven neonatal ICUs will survive, as the health ministry warned that they are in imminent danger if fuel does not reach hospitals soon.
"Without fuel to power the mechanical ventilation machines, all of these babies will die within five minutes," Bulbul said bluntly. "There are 10 ventilators, but seven are out of service."
On Sunday, UNICEF spokesperson   said out of 120 neonates in incubators, about 70 are on mechanical ventilation.
'If they [babies] are put in mechanical ventilation incubators, by definition, if you cut the electricity, we are worried about their lives,' Crickx told the AFP news agency.

Medical Aid for Palestine (MAP) has called on world leaders to demand Israel urgently allow fuel to enter the Gaza Strip.
"A failure to act is to sentence these babies to death," MAP's CEO Melanie Ward said. "The world cannot simply look on as these babies are killed by the siege on Gaza."
In a statement, the Gaza government media office stressed the necessity of opening the Rafah border crossing permanently, to bring in life supplies and humanitarian needs, especially fuel.
A total of 34 humanitarian aid trucks have entered the Gaza Strip, which is still below the minimum required by the catastrophic humanitarian reality, the statement said.
"Twenty more [aid convoys] are expected to enter today, which means a total of 10 percent of the rate that was entering the Gaza Strip daily before the aggression," it added.

Hospitals in north Gaza, where tens of thousands of internally displaced Palestinians have taken refuge, have received repeated Israeli military warnings to evacuate.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general for the World Health Organization, said it is "impossible for these overcrowded hospitals to safely evacuate patients".
'They must be allowed to perform their lifesaving functions. They must be protected,' he added.
The 17-day Israeli war has killed more than 5,000 Palestinians – almost half of them children – and has wounded more than 15,000 others.
A further 1,500 people are missing under the rubble, including 830 children.
Bulbul said that all 55 neonates in al-Shifa Hospital weigh less than two kilos and are under 37 weeks. One baby is 26 weeks and weighs 880 grams.
Other than fuel, another problem is the lack of basic treatments that these premature babies need, which can be lifesaving, the doctor explained.
"Within the first two hours of being born, premature babies need basic treatment to survive, most notably [synthetic] surfactant which helps to reduce respiratory distress syndrome," he said. "It's a lifesaving treatment and, without it, we have to deal with complications regarding mechanical ventilation, and as a result, the babies will spend longer in the incubators, at risk of bacterial infection which can kill them."

Bulbul said that even before the Israeli offensive began, there was a lack of antibiotics, such as ampicillin and gentamicin, which are
effective against all the bacterial agents causing community-acquired sepsis.
"The lack of these treatments pains us more than the Israeli air attacks," he said.
The neonatal unit is run by four doctors, but three of them are in the southern Gaza Strip and cannot come to al-Shifa Hospital because of the damaged roads.
Bulbul himself has not seen his family since October 7, and has been practically living in the hospital. Occasionally, if the communications network allows for it, he calls his family every two or three days, checking up on them in their home in Nuseirat refugee camp in the centre of the Gaza Strip.
"I and my team of nurses and other medical staff haven't had a day of rest, and we all work round the clock, despite being affected by the tragedy all around us," he said. "It's difficult to continue working under all this bombing, as we carry so much pain in our hearts, but we have no choice but to continue working and to try to save the lives of these babies."
