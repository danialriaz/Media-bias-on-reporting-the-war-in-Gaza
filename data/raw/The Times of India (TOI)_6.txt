Busy election roster, G20 presidency, new Parliament: Political trends that will define 2023

NEW DELHI: India witnessed a high-voltage political year in 2022 which started with five major elections, including in states like UP and Punjab, and ended with a classic clash of the titans in the states of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh.The Congress lost yet another state in Punjab but ended up winning Himachal - a consolation of sorts ahead of key battles lined up in 2023. The Aam Aadmi Party announced its arrival on the national stage after a historic victory in Punjab and encouraging gains in states like Gujarat.As usual, the BJP dominated the electoral roster with major victories in states like UP, Gujarat and Assam. In Gujarat, the saffron party easily cast aside the challenge posed by Congress and AAP to post the state's best-ever electoral performance by any party.Now, on to 2023.The year is crucial for two reasons. First, it will witness as many as 9 assembly elections, making it a politically hectic year for all the parties. And second, it will be the curtain raiser for next year's Lok Sabha elections.Here are the political trends to watch out for in 2023...9 elections 2023 will begin with key battles in the northeast and end with a crucial challenge in central and southern India.Elections are due in Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland, all three BJP-ruled states. The saffron party would be looking to hold on to its northeast bastion by retaining all three states with the help of crucial allies.Buoyed by its victories in Assam and Manipur this year, BJP is confident of sweeping the remaining northeast states in the absence of a strong opposition challenge.It remains to be seen whether the party's gambit to replace Tripura CM has any electoral impact next year.In May, it will be a high-octane contest in Karnataka - a state where both the ruling BJP and opposition Congress have a fair chance this time. 
Both parties are currently dealing with internal differences and leadership issues.Towards the end of 2023, elections will be held in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Notably, Congress won all three states in 2018. It later lost MP to BJP after a revolt by former leader Jyotiraditya Scindia.Nevertheless, it remains a formidable player in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.Elections will also be held in Mizoram where the ruling MNF is looking to stay in power. In Telangana, the BJP will be fancying its chances against the TRS, especially after pulling out all the stops in the Munugode bypolls held this year.New parliament building2023 will also see a landmark moment when the legislature will finally shift to the new Parliament building - most likely during the Budget session in February-March.Work is under way at a rapid pace to ensure that the shift happens sometime early next year after a series of missed deadlines this year.The new building would be a four-story structure with a seating capacity of 1,224, built at a cost of over Rs 1,000 crore. It would replace the existing colonial structure which completed a hundred years in 2021.Besides the optics, the shift has a deep-seated political implication as it is projected as part of the Modi government's vision of 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat'.It will also align with the Centre's vision of emerging from the colonial mindset, which was quite apparent with the renaming of Rajpath to Kartavya Path.Index of opposition unityIn most of the key elections lined up this year, it will be a traditional BJP vs Congress fight. This means most other opposition parties, including AAP, will have little opportunity to gain traction on the national stage.However, the battle in Telangana will be crucial as it will allow CM K Chandrashekar Rao's TRS (now BRS) to take the BJP head on. It will also give KCR a chance to revive his bid to build a united opposition front.Meanwhile, it will be crucial to see whether the opposition leaders like Nitish Kumar and Sharad Pawar are able to bring various parties together to form a united front.In 2022, there was a strong chorus to project JD(U) chief Nitish as the opposition's PM candidate. In the run up to the 2024 elections, the opposition front - if any - will have to shape up into something significant if it hopes to prepare a battle plan to counter BJP in the general election.Rahul on the roadRahul Gandhi spent most part of 2022 leading the Congress's Bharat Jodo Yatra, which is likely to conclude on January 26, 2023. The yatra, which traversed through multiple states, is being seen as an honest bid by the grand old party to re-energise its cadre base and possibly revive its fortunes before 2024.But the true test of the yatra's outcome will be in 2023 when Congress faces BJP in key states. In most of the states (Rajasthan, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, MP), Congress has a fair shot at overcoming the mountainous challenge posed by the saffron party.If the Congress does end up with a satisfactory scoreline, the party will certainly claim that Rahul and his months-long yatra bore fruit. It will also give the party a much-needed ballast before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, after two back-to-back dismal performances.However, if the Congress continues to fare poorly, the party will have to go back to the drawing board and review its strategy. It will also raise questions about Rahul's ability to lead the party, even as a leader if not the president.Meanwhile, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge would also work on some key organisational changes to unite the party at the structural level. His primary challenge would be the battle in Karnataka, his home state.Congress's fate in the southern state may well decide Kharge's own future as the party's head.India's G20 presidencyIndia assumed its G20 presidency starting December 2022 for a period of 11 months. While it's a big diplomatic boost for the country, it will also have political implications.Throughout 2023, India will be holding several G20 meetings involving global heads. Naturally, PM Modi will be at the focal point of these high-level engagements. He will have an opportunity to not just project India as an important global power but shine up his government's strong foreign policy credentials.Since 2014, Modi has been a busy PM when it comes to global diplomatic engagements. With historic visits to Israel and Palestine to mega events like "Howdy, Modi" in US, he has won crucial political brownie points by putting "India on the map".Ahead of 2024, Modi and his government will have a golden opportunity to hit the foreign policy home run by showcasing India as a global unifier and a key strategic player.

Modi changed the way India is looked at globally: Nadda

NEW DELHI: Asserting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has changed the way the country is looked at globally, BJP president J P Nadda on Wednesday said that India under Modi's leadership does not shy away from taking a stand on complex issues. Releasing the book, "Modi: Shaping a Global Order in Flux", Nadda explained that the Indian foreign policy is more assertive and firm as Indian government leaders earlier did not "dare" to visit Israel due to domestic vote bank politics. 
"Under the domestic vote bank politics compulsions, India couldn't develop a relationship with Israel. However, Prime Minister Modi visited Israel as well as Palestine," Nadda said."This shows India is capable of handling two different countries in the best possible manner, the BJP chief said.Nadda also said that Modi has also succeeded in de-hyphenating India with Pakistan which was not the case earlier. "There was a time when India used to be referred to with Pakistan by the global community. However, India has moved on in the world hierarchy," Nadda said. He said that relatively less is written on PM Modi's contribution to changing how India is looked at globally, and this book will start a debate."It is necessary to understand what was the image of India before Modi ji came to power. The economy was declining, India had an image of a corrupt state, repeated terrorist attacks and a lack of stable government. The very sad part was that the authority of the PM was eroded," Nadda said. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Look who's smiling: In praise of the still photograph

A picture, they say, is worth a thousand words. This one is worth more. For someone foreign to Indian politics could well mistake the men in this frame for bosom pals, almost in love with each other. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin are good with public display of courtesy and camaraderie (optics, if you may) but there is also a bit of this uncanny trick - or luck - of the photographer clicking just when the subject is moving from one gesture to another and gets caught in a transition moment that a video - or the human eye - doesn't quite capture in motion.That is the greatness of photographs.This greatness can freeze life in its most captivating moments. 
This greatness can also distort. Like a recent picture that went viral on social media that showed a dozen ministers in the assembly 'sleeping' (the exception being Udhayanidhi Stalin) while the session was on. In reality, they were all well awake, just that the photograph was clicked when, coincidentally, most of them were blinking (a little photoshop work cannot be ruled out). The same technique employed intentionally - sometimes accidentally - have 'caught' politicians including some American presidents ogling at some posteriors.At a G8 conference in 2015 in Germany, then US President Barack Obama and his French counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy were 'caught' in a photograph 'checking out' the backside of a Brazilian girl. The picture spurred a variety of hilarious stories including one on a study that found the average man spends 43 minutes every day eyeing about 10 women (I think that's a modest number), which adds up to 259 hours or 11 days a year, which means one year of women-gazing by a man who lives 33 adult years. And women? Nah, they don't ogle.The O-bum-a-gate, as German website Bild. com called it, turned out to be a fake, as videos later showed the President was but looking at the hand of another woman delegate who he was apparently helping get down a flight of steps. Sarkozy, however, didn't appear to be so innocent and the photograph remained abummer for the French president (not that he minded it). The Guardian once ran a feature on 'Politicians' embarrassing moments - in pictures', and most of the photographs were caught-in-transition moments. So, you had former US vice-president Al Gore snarling at a girl (2003), former British foreign secretary David Miliband playing with a banana (2008), the famous turkey tucking its head below former US President George Bush's belt (2001) and Dutch politician Geert Wilders poking his nose with a pen (2009).Photographs can be as poignant as they are playful. One of the images that have stayed with me was of a piece of paper that Israel Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had when he was assassinated on the night of November 4, 1995. Rabin had refused to wear a bullet-proof vest while addressing a peace rally of morethan a lakh people in Tel Aviv. After reading out a poem of peace, Rabin was walking towards his car when Yigal Amir, a 25-year-old Israeli Jew who couldn't stomach Rabin's call for peace with Palestinians, put two bullets into the military man-turned-politician. An hourand-a-half later, he was pronounced dead. And they found this piece of paper, stained with his blood, in his jacket pocket.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Eid Mubarak as Ramzan ends with namaz & sighting of moon

Lucknow: The crescent moon was sighted by the Markazi Chand Committee and Shia Markazi Chand Committee in the city on Friday, marking the celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr after the holy month of Ramzan on Saturday.
Soon after the announcement of the moon being sighted, people started thronging city markets to become a part of the 'chand raat' festivities. While some burnt firecrackers, others completed their last-minute shopping.
Besides, festival greetings flooded the social media sites, with #Eid Mubarak trending on Twitter.
Earlier in the day, Muslims in large number offered Alvida Namaz in various mosques in the Old City areas on Friday. After the prayers, the Shia and Sunni clerics condemned Israel for occupying Baitul Muqaddas and Qibla Awwal and further persecuting residents of Palestine. Imam Idgah and Qazi-e-Shahar Lucknow Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahli said that Masjid Aqsa is the third most sacred mosque after Masjid Haram and Masjid Nabvi Sall. He appealed to the international organizations to find a solution to the Palestine issue as soon as possible. He expressed concern over the injustice meted out to Muslims in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Myanmar, China and other parts of the world.
Similar views were raised by Majlise Ulama-e-Hind general secretary Maulana Sai Kalbe Jawad Naqvi. He said, "United Nations and the government of our country must take action against Israel for its act of terrorism in Gaza and Israel should be prosecuted in the International Court of Human Rights violations. The relocation of the American Embassy in Jerusalem should be declared illegal and India should not recognize Israel as a country. As Muslims have the first right on Jerusalem, strict steps should be taken against the American decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital."

By Mohammad DilshadMuzaffarnagar: Several students at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) held an agitation against Grand Mufti of Egypt Dr Shawki Ibrahim Abdel Qarib Allam outside the kennedy hall on campus on Tuesday criticising Egypt over its foreign policy towards Israel. While Dr Shawki was addressing a gathering at AMU, some students reached the spot carrying posters with slogans criticising him. Assistant proctor of AMU, Sayed Ali Nawab Zaidi, told TOI, "Some students suddenly appeared and started the protest against the guest as they were angry with the policy of Egypt toward Israel. 
All of them were made to return."Proctor Prof Mohammad Wasim Ali said, "The students had lodged a peaceful protest. A student said that in conflicts between Palestine and Israel, Egypt always takes the side of Israel, due to which there is resentment among Muslims around the world against Egypt."Notably, Dr Shawki was invited by AMU for a public address and he delivered a speech on "Dialogue among civilisations." He said, "There is a need to grasp and understand the true spirit of Islam, i.e engaging and dealing with people of all faiths, civilisations, and philosophies by seeking common grounds and recognising the diversities and differences which are divine gifts and blessings from god."Dr Shawki further said, "Building bridges and engaging with followers of different faiths has been the practice of the Prophet Mohammad until he passed away at the age of 63. The Prophet sent his companions to Abyssinia which was predominantly a Christian land and in Medina, he signed an agreement 'Constitution of Medina' in which he set the rules of engagement with Jewish clans and other residents of the city.""Prophet Mohammad was the epitome of mercy and compassion and he is a role model, particularly for Muslims in respect to their conduct and behaviour towards neighbours, friends, relatives, and humanity at large," he added.

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar and his visiting Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen reviewed the strategic partnership between the two countries with focus on enhancing cooperation in defence, security, water and agriculture. Cohen, who also called on PM Narendra Modi later in the day, cut short his three-day visit because of the deteriorating security situation at home following Israel's bombing of the Gaza Strip, in which three Palestinian militants were killed."The main pillars of our strategic partnership - agriculture, water, defence and security - are taking our ties forward.

India emerging as 'major player' in Middle East: US magazine

NEW DELHI: India has emerged as a major player in the Middle East over the last decade and US has overlooked its geopolitical rise due to its focus on China, an article in a noted US magazine said.An article in Foreign Policy, a magazine focused on global affairs, highlighted New Delhi's deep and growing ties with major countries in the region, including Israel, Saudi Arabia and UAE. It asserted that the evolution of India's place reflects the changing international order and the willingness - perhaps even eagerness - of these nations to benefit from the new multipolarity.The write-up by Steven A Cook said there is little that US can do about this development and may even, in a paradoxical way, benefit from it."If the United States' Middle Eastern partners are looking for an alternative to Washington, it is better that New Delhi is among the choices."The US may no longer be the undisputed big dog in the region, but as long as India expands its presence in the Middle East, neither Russia nor China can assume that role," he asserted.The article noted that India's ties with Israel are perhaps the most well-developed of New Delhi's relations in the region. It pointed out that in 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi became the first Indian leader to visit Israel. It said that when it comes to the Gulf, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are also aggressively seeking ways to expand relations with India.It is a significant shift because both countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, have long aligned with Pakistan, it said, noting that the pivot to India stems in part from a common interest in containing Islamist extremism but much of the pull is economic. 
"For its part, Saudi Arabia, which is India's second-largest supplier of oil and gas, wants to augment the energy relationship further by adding renewables into the mix," it said.In the past, India's business community shied away from investing in Israel, given the country's small market and controversial politics (to many in India), Cook says, adding this may be changing.In 2022, the Adani Group and an Israeli partner won a tender for Haifa Port for USD 1.2 billion, and there are also ongoing negotiations for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement, it said."Of course, the India-Israel relationship is complicated. India remains steadfast in its support for the Palestinians; has friendly ties with Iran, from which New Delhi has purchased significant amounts of oil; and Indian elites tend to see Israel through the prism of their country's own colonial experience," the article added.Referring to PM Modi's recent two-day visit to Egypt, it said by all measures, this was an episode in the ongoing Egyptian-Indian love fest, coming about six months after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was the guest of honour at India's 74th Republic Day celebration - his third visit to New Delhi since assuming power.Like the Chinese, the Indians regard Egypt as a gateway through which to send their goods to Africa and Europe, the article added.It is tempting for US policymakers and analysts, the author wrote, to view India's growing role in the region through the prism of great-power competition with China.An additional counterweight to Beijing in the Middle East would be helpful as the Biden administration shifts from de-emphasizing the region to regarding it as an area of opportunity to contain China, the piece said."And Modi's visit to Washington in late June was also a love fest, including a state dinner and address to a joint session of Congress," it said.Cook argued that for all the positive vibes of the US-India relations, it seems unlikely that New Delhi wants to be the strategic partner that Washington imagines.When it comes to the Middle East, India diverges sharply from the United States and Israel on Iran, and Washington should temper its expectations about what the expansion of India's economic and security ties to the Middle East means, the article said."It is unlikely that India will line up with the United States, but it is also unlikely that New Delhi will undercut Washington as both Beijing and Moscow have done," it said.It's time to take New Delhi's projection of power in the region seriously, the article added.

Israeli docs reattach boy's head to neck after accident

In a rare and complex operation that is not unprecedented, doctors in Israel last month reattached a 12-year-old boy's head to his neck after an accident in which he was hit by a car while riding his bicycle.According to a report published in Times of Israel recently, Suleiman Hassan, a Palestinian from the West Bank, was airlifted to the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem after the accident. The doctors there found that the ligaments holding the posterior base of Hassan's skull were severely damaged, leaving it detached from the top vertebrae of his spine. The condition is commonly known as internal or orthopaedic decapitation. The injury is very rare in adults, and even more so in children.Dr Ohad Einav, the orthopaedic specialist who led a large team of doctors andparamedics said the surgery was very complicated and took several hours. "While in the operating room, we used new plates and fixations in the damaged area. "Hassan was recently discharged from the hospital with a cervical splint. "The fact that such a child has no neurological deficits or sensory or motor dysfunction, and that he is functioning normally and walking without an aid after such a long process, is no small thing," Dr Einav said.

The Munich Massacre refers to a tragic and high-profile terrorist attack that occurred during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany. The attack took place on September 5, 1972, and it targeted the Jewish Israeli Olympic team. The terrorist attack was carried out by a Palestinian terrorist organization known as Black September. 
The group was seeking the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and used the Olympics as a platform to draw international attention to their cause.On the morning of September 5, 1972, eight members of the Black September group scaled the perimeter fence of the Olympic Village, where the Jewish Israeli athletes were staying. They were armed with firearms and grenades.The terrorists broke into the apartments housing the Israeli athletes and took 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage. During the initial breach of the apartments, two athletes were killed, and nine others were captured.NThe terrorists demanded the release of over 200 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, along with safe passage out of West Germany. Negotiations between the German authorities and the terrorists began but were largely unsuccessful.The German authorities attempted to rescue the hostages at the Frstenfeldbruck airbase, but the operation was poorly planned and executed. In a shootout with the terrorists, all remaining hostages were killed. One terrorist was captured alive.The Munich Massacre shocked the world and led to widespread condemnation of the terrorist act. The International Olympic Committee suspended the games for one day and held a memorial service for the victims.In the wake of the Munich Massacre, Israel launched a covert operation known as "Operation Wrath of God" to track down and assassinate those responsible for the attack and others involved in Black September. This operation lasted for several years.All in all, the Munich Massacre remains a significant event in Olympic history and in the broader context of international terrorism. It highlighted the vulnerability of large-scale sporting events to terrorist attacks and led to increased security measures at subsequent Olympics. Additionally, it drew attention to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the tactics used by Palestinian militant groups to further their goals. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

According to an Israeli official in the Prime Minister's Office, Saudi Arabia has conveyed its decision to halt discussions aimed at normalizing relations with Israel to the Biden administration, The Jerusalem Post reported. This development was also reported by the Arab news outlet Elaph.As per this unverified report, Riyadh communicated its decision through the United States, citing concerns about the "extremist" nature of Israel's right-wing government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
The Saudi perspective, as outlined by Elaph, is that this government's policies hinder any potential reconciliation with the Palestinians, and consequently, with Saudi Arabia.The report further elaborates that Saudi Arabia was discouraged from pursuing a potential peace agreement due to what it perceived as Netanyahu's willingness to accommodate demands from figures like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, whom the Saudis view as "extremely right-wing."Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the importance of resolving Palestinian issues for any normalization agreement with Israel. Blinken stated that Saudi Arabia had informed the Biden administration of this critical aspect. He also asserted that while efforts to improve relations between Israel and its neighbors were ongoing, these initiatives could not substitute for a resolution of differences between Israel and the Palestinians, which he believed should involve a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Additionally, last month, Foreign Minister Eli Cohen emphasized in an interview with Elaph that the "Palestinian issue is not an obstacle to peace."

Netanyahu-Biden meeting signals strained US-Israel relations amid delay and venue change

Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday, marking their first encounter since Netanyahu assumed leadership of Israel's far-right government late last year. While Netanyahu has historically been a frequent guest at the White House, the extended delay in arranging this meeting and the decision to hold it in New York instead of Washington have sparked speculation in Israel about U.S. reservations regarding Netanyahu's new government, reported AP.Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israeli relations at Israel's Bar-Ilan University, noted that a White House meeting typically symbolizes close ties, friendship, and honor, and the decision to hold it elsewhere might convey the opposite sentiment. Consequently, many anticipate a challenging and potentially tense meeting.The White House has maintained secrecy about the agenda for the Wednesday meeting. 
Nevertheless, it is expected that Biden administration officials will raise concerns about Netanyahu's contentious plan to reform Israel's judicial system. Netanyahu contends that unelected judges hold excessive power over government decisions, while critics argue that these changes could undermine the independent judiciary and move Israel toward authoritarianism.Netanyahu's judicial plan has deeply divided the nation and sparked widespread protests against his government, which have even extended to the U.S. Israeli expatriates are anticipated to protest outside Wednesday's meeting in Manhattan during the U.N. General Assembly.Earlier this year, President Biden expressed dissatisfaction with Netanyahu's judicial overhaul, urging him to seek a compromise. However, negotiations between Netanyahu and the Israeli opposition have stalled, and his coalition has moved forward with the legislative process, passing a major piece of the plan in July.In addition to judicial reform, the Israeli government's treatment of the Palestinians has drawn criticism from the U.S. Netanyahu's coalition includes far-right ultranationalists who have expanded Israeli settlements on land claimed by Palestinians for a future state. Furthermore, Israel's government opposes the two-state solution, a key aspect of U.S. policy in the region, leading to increased tensions and conflict in the West Bank.The White House has stated that the talks on Wednesday will focus on "shared democratic values" and a vision for a more stable and integrated region. However, this meeting occurs at a time when relations between Israel and the Democratic Party are cooling. A poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research revealed that while Americans generally view Israel as a partner or ally, there are growing questions about whether Netanyahu's government aligns with American values, with Republicans more likely than Democrats to consider Israel an ally with shared values.Despite the location of the meeting being in New York and not Washington, Biden administration officials have downplayed its significance, suggesting that Netanyahu will eventually receive an invitation to the White House, with the timing depending on the outcome of Wednesday's meeting.

Israeli airstrikes ravage terror targets in Gaza amid escalating West Bank tensions

Israeli airstrikes continued in Gaza for a third consecutive day, triggered by Palestinian militants near the border launching incendiary balloons and explosives at soldiers, reported AP. These strikes followed an Israeli military raid in the northern West Bank, which reportedly resulted in the deaths of two Palestinians.This surge in violence has heightened concerns, particularly as it occurs during a sensitive Jewish holiday period. Tensions have escalated along the Israel-Gaza border, raising concerns about a potential escalation similar to the brief conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group in May. 
The situation is unfolding as Jews prepare to observe Yom Kippur, the holiest day on their calendar, followed by the Sukkot festival later in the month.Despite the airstrikes in Gaza, there were no reported casualties. Earlier on the same day, the Israeli military shot and injured five Palestinians protesting at the separation fence along the Israeli frontier with Gaza. Such protests are common among Palestinians in Gaza as they demand an end to the 16-year blockade imposed by Israel with Egypt's assistance. Israel argues that the blockade is necessary to prevent the arming of the ruling Hamas militant group in Gaza.The Israeli army has indicated that it targeted two Hamas posts near the Gaza-Israel border, where Palestinians have been holding daily demonstrations. These protests have involved the launching of incendiary balloons attached to explosive devices into Israel, sparking fires.Tensions have also flared in the West Bank. In one incident, the Israeli military entered the Nour Shams refugee camp to target a militant command center and bomb-storage facility, resulting in clashes and casualties. In another, Birzeit University reported an Israeli raid on its campus, resulting in the arrest of nine students, including the head of the student council. Israel claimed the suspects were planning attacks on Israeli targets.Israel has been conducting increased military raids in the West Bank over the past year and a half, aiming to root out Palestinian militants and prevent future attacks. However, Palestinians argue that these raids further solidify Israel's occupation of the West Bank, contributing to the weakening of the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied territory. The violence has led to numerous casualties on both sides in the West Bank this year. Meanwhile, Palestinian attacks against Israelis have also resulted in casualties.These escalations coincide with the Jewish New Year holiday season and raise concerns, especially with the upcoming Sukkot festival and the potential for heightened tensions around Jerusalem's sensitive holy sites. Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war, territories sought by the Palestinians for their future state. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com
