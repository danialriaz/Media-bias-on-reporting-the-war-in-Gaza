Binance enabled funds to be funnelled to Hamas, other militant groups

Washington  In February 2019, Binance Holdings' then chief compliance officer Samuel Lim acknowledged that the cryptocurrency exchange was being used to funnel money to Hamas, saying to a colleague that terrorists normally sent "small sums".
 Hamas could "barely buy an AK47 with 600 bucks", the colleague responded in a chat message, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) March lawsuit against the world's largest crypto exchange.
 That apparently nonchalant attitude caught up with Binance and its chief executive officer Zhao Changpeng on Tuesday. In announcing US$4.3 billion (S$5.8 billion) in fines against the firm and a guilty plea by Zhao for failing to comply with anti-money laundering laws, the US government put Hamas and terrorist organisations front and centre. The broad settlement also resolves the CFTC suit.
 "Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform," the Treasury Department said in a statement that named Hamas, Al-Qaeda, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as terrorist organisations that received funds through the exchange.
 Binance's settlement and Zhao's guilty plea come as Hamas is embroiled in a war with Israel, sparked by the group's Oct 7 attacks that killed more than 1,200 people, with more than 200 others taken hostage. Israel responded by invading Gaza, where thousands more have been killed.
 In a press conference, US Attorney-General Merrick Garland said Zhao "wilfully violated federal law that requires financial institutions to guard against money laundering and terrorist financing".
 According to the US government, Binance failed to report suspicious transactions with terrorists. As part of its settlement, the company will have to file those reports going forward and review past activity it should have disclosed.
 "This will advance our criminal investigations into malicious cyber activity and terrorism fundraising, including the use of cryptocurrency exchanges to support groups such as Hamas," Mr Garland said.
 Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) will receive US$3.4 billion of the fines paid by Binance, while its Office of Foreign Assets Control will get US$968 million. The FinCEN fine is the largest in that bureau's history.
 A number of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have expressed cavalier attitudes about terrorists or other bad actors using their platforms. BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed in 2022 pleaded guilty to wilfully failing to implement anti-money laundering and customer identification policies at their crypto derivatives exchange.
 Former Ethereum Foundation researcher Virgil Griffith was sentenced in 2022 to more than five years in prison for participating in a 2019 blockchain and cryptocurrency conference in North Korea. 
 At the conference, Griffith discussed how North Korean money might be converted into cryptocurrency as a way to evade sanctions. 
 Photos showed the researcher dressed in a North Korean-style uniform, standing in front of a whiteboard on which he drew a smiley face and wrote "No sanctions yay". BLOOMBERG

The Anwar govt a year on: Stability restored but major challenges remain

Byline: Ariel Tan, The Anwar govt a year on: Stability restored but major challenges remain
Body


Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is concluding his administration's one-year anniversary on a high note. 
 His ease and eloquence on the international stage, on display during his visits to key partners in Asia and the Middle East, and to the United States for multilateral meetings, contrast him well against his recent predecessors. He has enhanced relations with neighbours and friends such as Singapore and China, with a pragmatic focus on Malaysia's economic interests. On his recent visit to San Francisco, he announced that Malaysia had received proposed investments worth more than RM63 billion (S$18 billion) from major technology companies.
 On the domestic front, he has the support of 151 Members of Parliament, including those who recently crossed over from Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, out of the total of 222 seats. 
 His ascension to power on Nov 24, 2022, followed a traumatic period in Malaysian politics -- the country suffered a Covid-19-induced battering and had gone through four prime ministers since 2018. 
 Datuk Seri Anwar's turn at the premiership came on the back of urban and multiracial support for Pakatan Harapan (PH) in the 2022 General Election as well as political skills hewn over decades that enabled him to corral acceptance from a diverse group of players, from the Malay rulers to erstwhile rivals in Umno and East Malaysian ruling coalitions. With the massive financial and administrative resources that come with incumbency, he has kept partners onside so far. 
 His prioritising of political support from these groups and efforts to win over the conservative Malay majority are critical for political survival, but have come at a cost to PH's reformist brand. His highly personalised approach to the presidency also risks diminishing his Cabinet and coalition partners. 
 While his is a more disciplined Cabinet than the first PH government in 2018, it could be useful for the component parties and leaders to be more prominently included in his efforts to win over various segments of the population. A cohesive Cabinet-level team that explains, tracks and updates the public on the implementation and results of key initiatives could win more public confidence in the economy and government. 
 Mr Anwar deserves credit for delivering political stability, but this has to be a means and not a goal. He himself recently stressed the importance of policy clarity for investors and that a leader must deliver rather than just espouse pious platitudes. 
 Total politics He spent the better part of his first year in office campaigning for elections in six states in August 2023. Opposition leader Muhyiddin Yassin had shrewdly painted the state elections as a referendum on the fledging federal government, and Mr Anwar apparently could not resist this challenge. 
 Mr Anwar sought acceptance of his personal brand of unity government, with the achievements of the more established state governments and their popular leaders receiving less attention. The results were as expected: status quo in state holdings, but lower Malay support for PH-Umno. He has not won back Malay confidence despite strenuous efforts. Both Umno and Mr Anwar do not appear to have revised their strategy. Umno's deep social capital among Malays is eroding largely because of the leadership of its president Zahid Hamidi. The party's supporters are gravitating towards Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS). While Deputy Prime Minister Zahid is viewed as the glue keeping Umno with Mr Anwar's PH coalition, Mr Anwar would have to cultivate Umno's broader leadership and base to avoid the risk of his government becoming unstuck over one single point of failure. 
 The prosecution's dropping of graft charges against Datuk Seri Zahid has undermined PH's and Mr Anwar's stated commitment to fighting corruption. Notably, former prime minister Najib Razak's allies have agitated for his release from jail, but this has not panned out. Mr Anwar's own Tourism Minister Tiong King Sing has alleged a "culture of corruption" among immigration officers and "chronic abuse of power" at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Indeed, Mr Anwar has had to tread carefully with the civil service as it forms a significant part of the Malay vote bank and its cooperation is critical for his administration to implement its policies. 
 PH supporters have also been disappointed with the coalition for practices it had criticised while in opposition. These include appointing politicians to government-linked companies, accepting party-hoppers, and the launch of investigations into individuals under the Sedition Act 1948, the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, and the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984. The government has promised reforms, but it has to be cautious, particularly where they touch on sensitive matters like Islam and Malay royalty. 
 Meanwhile, East Malaysian ruling coalitions are leveraging their support for Mr Anwar to press for more autonomy over key areas like education, energy and food security. This has to be handled carefully to promote better governance without sacrificing national unity. Many believe they would not join the opposition, but much depends on the trade-offs offered. 
 Race and religion Mr Anwar is under pressure from the opposition (led by PAS and conservative Malay party Bersatu), who accuse his administration of neglecting Malay-Muslim interests. But his efforts to rebuild his pious Malay-Muslim image carry risks.
 His handling of the Israel-Palestine issue illustrates this. While there is longstanding and broad sympathy among Malaysians for Palestinians, Mr Anwar's refusal to condemn Hamas has stoked unease among some non-Muslims, who fear that public support for the Palestinian cause could spiral out of control, as there have been incidents such as boycotts against businesses in Malaysia that allegedly support Israel. 
 A Palestine Solidarity Week in schools provoked an outcry when videos emerged of students brandishing toy guns and being encouraged to desecrate the Israeli flag. Leaders of Mr Anwar's coalition expressed concern over the initiative launched by the Education Ministry, while leaders in East Malaysia responded that their schools would not comply. Groups in Sarawak and Sabah have stated that they would not accept Palestinian refugees. 
 The prime minister cannot back down entirely, but the result has been an unprecedented sense of division and cynicism over the government's position on the Israel-Palestine conflict. 
 He also risks alienating Malaysia's international partners, as Hamas is unwelcome among key states in the Middle East and the West. 
 Policymaking All this takes place against a frenetic background of daily announcements of government plans. The unity government has issued the well-received National Energy Transition Roadmap, the New Industrial Master Plan 2030, and the 12th Malaysia Plan Mid-Term Review. 
 Yet, it was perhaps telling that a leaked e-mail from Maybank in July 2023, which characterised the prime minister's policies as "yet unclear", went viral. Although subsequently withdrawn, it appeared to have struck a chord, reflecting the confusion felt by some. Indeed, the government's most timely and popular initiative is also the simplest to understand -- the Menu Rahmah, RM5 budget meals offered by private eateries targeted at the working class. 
 Economic reform has been the major challenge of recent governments. Malaysia has limited fiscal resources to address government debt and deficit as well as the country's growing needs. 
 Revenue collection is lower than that of other comparable economies, but successive governments have found that withdrawing subsidies and imposing new taxes can be politically costly, particularly with their Malay constituents. 
 While the government had been open to reimposing the unpopular goods and services tax, that has been shelved for now. Subsidy rationalisation has been talked about but, save details on diesel, no comprehensive approach has been announced. 
 Bank Negara has projected a 4 per cent growth for 2023. The 2024 budget tabled in October was Malaysia's biggest and should support a 4 per cent to 5 per cent growth for 2024, but questions remain on how Malaysia is to gain a stronger fiscal footing. Meanwhile, the ringgit hit its lowest point against the US dollar in the same month. 
 While largely due to negative external factors, the performance of the ringgit and the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange do not reflect confidence in the economy. 
 For businesses which depend on imported goods and services, the weak ringgit has meant rising overheads, while for the man in the street, it adds to cost-of-living woes in a year that has seen sharp rises in the prices of rice and other food items. Little surprise, then, that Mr Anwar's approval ratings have fallen to 50 per cent from 68 per cent in December 2022 because of public concerns over the economy, according to Malaysian pollster Merdeka Center. 
 Mr Anwar is finance minister, although PH had previously objected to prime ministers holding the finance portfolio. He has tabled two budgets and regularly fronts headline announcements. But repeated calls for him to appoint a second finance minister reflect concerns that he is overstretched and not giving the portfolio the attention it deserves. High-level attention there is needed to oversee the planning and implementation of fiscal reforms. 
 He has also been criticised for his Cabinet. He has not appointed a minister for domestic trade since the incumbent died in July. While ministers closest to Mr Anwar may be unfairly dismissed by critics as little more than his cheerleaders, some are new in government and just learning to work with the federal bureaucracy. Others like Transport Minister Anthony Loke, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office in charge of law and institutional reforms Azalina Othman Said, and Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz are more experienced, giving confidence that progress is being made in transport development, law reforms and trade and investment promotion. 
 Policy statements traditionally involve bureaucratic support and preparation. However, government communications have at times appeared to trail Mr Anwar's surprising remarks. Examples include his comment that all letters to the government had to be in Malay, provoking pushback from East Malaysians, who also use English. 
 Mr Anwar's comment that Malaysia was open to holding negotiations with China on the South China Sea dispute necessitated clarification from the Foreign Ministry that Malaysia "is unequivocally and firmly committed to protecting Malaysia's sovereignty, sovereign rights and interests in its maritime areas in the South China Sea, as depicted by our 1979 map". 
 Fragmented politics,  complex challenges Given the growing complexity of policymaking and Malaysia's fragmented and competitive political system, an administration that centres too much on a solo performer and elite trade-offs runs a higher risk of quickly disaggregating and its components and allies re-orientating around another coalition before or after the next general election, due in 2027. 
 But just one year into its term, this administration of a broad coalition has time and a historic opportunity to institute reforms that Mr Anwar has called for since the 1997 to 1998 Asian financial crisis and his sacking from Umno and the government. He would have a better chance of success with a more cohesive and involved Cabinet and coalition delivering better governance. 
 And because voters may vote on identity even while telling pollsters that their priorities are economic, the government has to tread carefully. It would have to introduce reforms and grow the economy while giving reassurances to both its Malay and non-Malay constituents.

India, US partnership deepens, but limits remain

WASHINGTON With India wielding more influence in a multipolar world, its foreign policy is much discussed in Washington, especially after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit in June -- a high honour for a foreign leader. 
 While India is happy to work with the United States to counterbalance China, it will always act in its own national interest -- and not take sides in foreign conflicts. Thus its partnership with the US, while deepening, has its limits, noted analysts on this week's Asian Insider podcast. 
 India's support for Israel is a recent example of how New Delhi nuances its positions in areas where it has interests. It does not necessarily follow the US' lead. 
 In October, India joined 44 other countries in abstaining from a United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, as it did not contain any condemnation of Hamas' Oct 7 attack on Israel. The US was one of only 14 countries that opposed the resolution, citing the same reason.
 Less than two weeks later, India was among 145 countries that voted for a UN resolution that condemned Israeli settlements in the West Bank. In contrast, the US was among seven that voted against it. 
 India's foreign policy has been remarkably consistent, said Dr Aparna Pande, author of two books on Indian foreign policy and director of the Initiative on the Future Of India and South Asia at the conservative Hudson Institute. 
 India does not take sides in any conflict, but instead advocates peaceful negotiations, she said. 
 Even as India condemns terrorism, its support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Palestinian cause remains. "There's a nuance there," she said. 
 The four-nation Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) is another example of India's nuanced foreign policy. 
 India is the only country that is not a formal security ally of the other Quad members -- Australia, Japan and the US -- but is nevertheless part of a group that is key to the Americans' strategy to counter China. 
 India, which will chair the group and host its annual summit in 2024, is at the heart of the US-led Indo-Pacific strategy. 
 Yet notwithstanding its alignment with the US, New Delhi also participates in non-Western groupings that include both Russia and China. 
 One example is Brics, made up originally of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. At its August summit in South Africa, the group invited Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to become full members. 
 Such arrangements show a desire by Indian leaders to ensure that their country is not viewed as a follower of the West, Dr Pande wrote in November in the journal GIS. 
 India's Minister for External Affairs, Dr S. Jaishankar, elaborated on this point in September during a talk at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. "A country of the scale and complexity of India has to often assess its situation and dig into its own experiences and DNA to come up... (with)... an independent pathway," he said.
 Dr Satu Limaye, vice-president of the East West Centre, an education and research organisation, said New Delhi would welcome the US playing a greater role in the Indian Ocean. Indian strategists and officials have growing concerns about when China will have a carrier strike group or other large capabilities in the region. 
 "This is quite a change from an earlier era when the US was not particularly welcome in the Indian Ocean," said Dr Limaye, speaking alongside Dr Pande on this week's Asian Insider podcast. 
 There remains, however, a fundamental difference between Indian and American views of the world, he noted. 
 "The US believes that it should be the pre-eminent power in the world, sometimes framed as leadership... but India sees a world evolving towards multipolarity, in which its role naturally and properly constitutes one pole."
 Dr Limaye said there is a "very compelling need for India and the United States to work together". Their partnership would be mostly focused on technology, with defence, security and politics being other areas of cooperation.
 With the Global South distrustful of the Global North, "it's useful for the US to have partners who, frankly, think well of the US", he added.

The truce between Israel and Hamas held for a second day on Nov 25, with both sides expected to release more hostages and Palestinian prisoners. On Nov 24, 13 Israelis were released along with 10 Thais and a Filipino as part of a truce between the two sides. More aid has also begun to pour into Gaza since the ceasefire, with four tankers of fuel and another four containing cooking gas entering the southern Gaza Strip via the Rafah crossing early yesterday. The Israeli authorities said these were meant for essential humanitarian infrastructure in Gaza, such as hospitals.

Miracles do happen, says father of Thai worker freed from captivity

BANGKOK  Mr Kongpana Sudlamai has had sleepless nights for nearly two months, anxiously waiting for news about his son, who was among the hundreds abducted in Israel by militant group Hamas in October. 
 On Nov 26, the 52-year-old was restless again, but this time out of excitement upon learning that his son, Mr Phonsawan Pinakalo, 30, had been released. 
 "Miracles really do happen," he said in a social media post.
 "I have been waiting for good news. At first, I thought my son already died since they found so many bodies," he told The Straits Times, adding that he received a call at 3am (Bangkok time) from Thai officials. 
 "I was so happy, I couldn't sleep," he added. 
 His son is among a third batch of hostages -- 17 of them -- transferred from Gaza as part of a temporary truce between Hamas and Israel.
 So far, Hamas has released 58 hostages under a four-day ceasefire deal agreed by the two sides that began on Nov 24. 
 On Nov 26, three Thai nationals, 13 Israelis and one Russian were freed in exchange for 39 Palestinians, according to officials and Palestinian media. 
 On Nov 27, Thai Premier Srettha Thavisin said on social media platform X that the three Thais are in good health. 
 Altogether, 17 Thai nationals who were freed by Hamas have been named. 
 Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara is scheduled to travel to Israel to bring them home on Nov 30. Mr Parnpree, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, will also visit three Thai nationals who are injured and hospitalised, and the Thai community in Israel.
 "For the remaining 15 Thai hostages, the... government continues to exert all efforts towards their safe release at the earliest opportunity," said the Thai Foreign Ministry. 
 Pictures released by the ministry show the freed Thai nationals receiving medical care, as well as embracing one another at Shamir Medical Centre in Israel. 
 Mr Kongpana said he has not had the chance to speak with his son, as the latter is undergoing 48-hour medical observation.
 About 240 people from 40 countries were captured on Oct 7 when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel. There were at least 30 Thai nationals, making up the single largest group of foreigners among the hostages. 
 According to the Thai authorities, at least 39 Thais were killed and 19 injured in the attack, which also targeted farming villages near the Gaza Strip where thousands of Thai nationals work. 
 The attack that killed about 1,200 people has resulted in an escalation of violence in the long-running Israel-Palestinian conflict. 
 Mr Kongpana said that on Oct 7, his son, a tractor driver at a farm less than 4km from the Gaza border, had a day off from work. The duo, who are from Nakhon Ratchasima in Thailand's north-east, had a short video call that morning. 
 "He said he heard gunshots, which was unusual for the farm area," added Mr Kongpana. His son and others took shelter in a bunker for a few hours. But by the afternoon, Mr Phonsawan was uncontactable. 
 Like many other Thai nationals, Mr Phonsawan had gone to work in Israel's agricultural sector for better wages, about four years ago. The basic salary of a farmhand in Israel can be at least four times the 15,000 baht (S$570) earned in Thailand for a similar job. 
 Before the Oct 7 attack, there were about 30,000 Thai nationals working in Israel, with the majority linked to farms and orchards, including areas close to Gaza. 
 While nearly 8,000 have been repatriated since the outbreak of war, many more have chosen to stay on despite safety concerns.

Shanmugam flags rise in anti-S'pore sentiments on social media

Body


There has been a noticeable increase in anti-Singapore sentiments on social media from around the region since the Oct 7 attack by Hamas in Israel and the retaliatory military action by Israel in Gaza. 
 Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said on Nov 27 that the comments have come from those who see Singapore as being pro-West or pro-Israel. 
 "Some have said that Singapore is Tanah Melayu, on Malay Lands -- as a parallel, they say, to Israel being on Palestinian land. There have also been calls online for Singapore to be targeted using 'rockets' and 'bombs'," said Mr Shanmugam, who was speaking at a National Day Awards event to recognise Home Team officers. 
 He said global terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as well as their supporters, have also used the current conflict to renew their calls for attacks. 
 "The threat is there, and it has gotten higher," he added. 
 The war started on Oct 7, when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 240 hostages. The Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 12,000 people, including 5,000 children.
 A temporary ceasefire took hold in the Gaza Strip on Nov 24 after 48 days of conflict, but both sides have said the war is not over.
 Mr Shanmugam noted that the attack by Hamas involved a high level of tactical planning and coordination, but was done with relatively low-tech equipment and weapons. 
 It caught Israel, a high-tech society, completely by surprise, he said, adding that from a security perspective, there are lessons to learn. 
 "An attack, like what happened to Israel, could happen anywhere, including here, and there will be people who will be encouraged to do copycat attacks," said the minister. 
 He said Singaporeans can and should sympathise with the civilians who are suffering, call for and pray for an end to the violence, and contribute to trusted humanitarian drives. 
 "But we have to be careful not to let what is happening in the Middle East undermine the peace and harmony we have in Singapore," he said.   
 Speaking at the Ministry of Home Affairs' National Day Awards investiture ceremony held at The Star Performing Arts Centre, Mr Shanmugam said Home Team officers face other significant security challenges including scams, online criminal harms, misinformation, foreign interference and drugs. 
 As a Central Narcotics Bureau officer, Assistant Superintendent (ASP) of Police Desmond Liang has seen first-hand how drugs take their toll on the users. 
 The father of three has also witnessed the impact on children. 
 ASP Liang, 39, said: "Toddlers running about, with drugs on the table and drug-taking utensils lying around, are a common sight during drug raids." 
 Once, he found two young children unattended while their parents crashed after a drug-induced high. They asked him for food -- it was in the late afternoon, and they had not yet eaten. He made arrangements for them to get lunch and be taken care of. 
 Growing up in such an environment takes its toll, he said. 
 Today, the 18-year veteran is in charge of CNB's training curriculum, using his experiences on the ground to train officers to perform their duties safely and effectively. 
 He was one of 896 award recipients honoured at the annual Ministry of Home Affairs event.
 Another award recipient was Assistant Superintendent of Prisons Ponnarasi Gopal Chandra.
 The 40-year-old is a team leader at work release centre Institution S2, which helps offenders reintegrate into society towards the end of their sentences. 
 The process is not always smooth sailing. Once, an offender under her charge absconded from a halfway house for five days, fearing that his debtors would track him down. 
 ASP Ponnarasi spoke with him on the phone daily, and got him to confide his problems. He was stressed about his elderly and sick parents, and had issues with his girlfriend. 
 She told him that running away was not a solution, and that channels existed for his parents to receive assistance. She also enlisted his parents' help to convince him to return. He finally did, and she welcomed him back via video call. 
 The 20-year veteran of the prison service says she sometimes receives updates from her former charges, telling her that they are doing well. 
 "This kind of thing keeps me going," she said.
