Gaza, Ukraine crises will not affect US-China competition: Analysts

Byline: Elizabeth Law, Gaza, Ukraine crises will not affect US-China competition: Analysts
Body


BEIJING The United States is unlikely to take its eye off strategic competition with China, despite Washington's preoccupation with the wars in the Gaza Strip and Ukraine, say analysts. 
 Demonstrating the US' twin priorities this week, US President Joe Biden requested emergency funds for military aid to its allies and for border security, days after the White House said it would curb the export of advanced artificial intelligence chips to China. 
 The Ukraine war and the Middle East crisis notwithstanding, it is "impossible" that Americans would take their eyes off US-China relations, said Professor Zhu Feng, executive dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University. 
 He expects the US to maintain its strategic competition and policies aimed at containing China, which the US considers its most significant competitor.
 Mr Biden on Thursday made a rare speech from the Oval Office after a whirlwind visit to Israel the day before. 
 Focusing largely on recent events in Gaza and the Ukraine war that is going into its second year, he said America, as "the essential nation", cannot walk away from supporting its partners and allies in the war.
 US officials expect that he will ask for US$100 billion (S$137 billion) over the next year for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, and security along the porous US border with Mexico. 
 Shortly before Mr Biden's speech on Thursday, the Pentagon released a report saying that China will probably have more than 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030. 
 Beijing countered that the report was full of prejudice and distorted facts, adding that China has no intention of engaging in a nuclear arms race. 
 "As long as any country does not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against China, it will not be threatened by China's nuclear weapons," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning at a regular press briefing on Friday. 
 Earlier this week, the US also announced a ban on exports of advanced AI chips to China,to stop the Chinese government from advancing its military. This has resulted in a run on such chips in China, and could have a spillover effect of halting AI development in China's private sector. 
 The likelihood that the US will be aiding Taiwan out of the package Mr Biden will request from Congress will further strain ties with Beijing. 
 Professor Shi Yinhong, director of the Centre on American Studies at Renmin University, noted that cross-strait tensions are already high after the White House announced some US$345 million in military aid in July.
 Over two days in August following the July announcement, six Chinese warships and 33 military aircraft appeared around Taiwan, with six crossing the median line. 
 Prof Shi believes that any fresh finance injections from the US could substantially increase Taiwan's combat capability.
 Assistant Professor Dylan Loh of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) noted the increased communication between Mr Biden and President Xi Jinping, and the possibility of a meeting between them next month. 
 "All of these signals sent from both sides are merely to ensure that they can still co-exist, put a floor to their relationship, with hopes that the competition will not spill into confrontation or conflict," said Prof Loh, who is from NTU's Public Policy and Global Affairs division.
 Still, the US-China relationship will continue to be characterised by intense and deep competition, he said.
 Pointing to the geopolitical influence wielded by the US and China, Prof Zhu said that while strategic competition between both nations is unlikely to change, it would benefit the world if both sides worked together. 
 On Thursday, China's special Middle East envoy, Mr Zhai Jun, kicked off his tour of the region to help de-escalate the Gaza crisis. 
 On the same day, Chinese President Xi called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as he met Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly in Beijing. 
 He said that China is willing to work with Cairo and other Arab countries for a "lasting solution" to the Palestinian issue.
 But US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said Beijing's stance on Hamas remains a point of contention between the two superpowers -- the US has expressed strong support for Israel, while China has expressed support for the Palestinian cause and not condemned Hamas. 
 Beijing has also refused to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has irked the US and its Western allies.
 Prof Zhu said: "The question is, can the Ukraine issue and the new Middle East conflicts be effectively resolved and contained without China's support'
 "The challenge for US-China relations is still how to compete and cooperate at the same time."

Biden makes case for US as 'indispensable nation' but walks a tightrope at home

WASHINGTON United States President Joe Biden has put America's credibility and power on the line in pledging continued support for both Israel and Ukraine, in a rare primetime televised address to the nation from the Oval Office on Thursday.
 "We are, as my friend Madeleine Albright said, 'the indispensable nation'," he said in his 15-minute address, in a reference to the late former US Secretary of State. 
 "Tonight, there are innocent people all over the world who hope because of us, who believe in a better life because of us, who are desperate not to be forgotten by us, and who are waiting for us," he said.
 In a reflection of not just foreign policy challenges but also domestic complications, Mr Biden also walked a tightrope in his speech between support for Israel and relations with the wider Islamic world -- for example, by denouncing both Islamophobia and anti-Semitism in his speech. 
 His address comes at a time when tempers are fraying at home over the war in Gaza.
 On Thursday, the Marriott hotel in Arlington, Virginia, cancelled an event scheduled for Saturday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, America's largest Muslim civil liberties organisation, after anonymous callers threatened to plant bombs, kill hotel staff and storm the hotel. 
 In an open letter on Thursday, Jewish and Muslim Congressional staff said: "We write to implore our bosses, members of the United States Congress, to join calls for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas."
 Last week, a six-year-old Palestinian boy was stabbed to death in a Chicago suburb; his mother was also critically wounded. The perpetrator was their 71-year-old landlord who had reportedly become obsessed with the Israel-Hamas war. 
 "We can't stand by and stand silent when this happens," Mr Biden said. "We must, without equivocation, denounce anti-Semitism. We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia."
 On Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in an internal note to all staff, referred to "ripples of fear and bigotry" against Arab Americans, Muslims and Jews. He maintained that the administration's approach had been balanced. 
 "President Biden has made clear from the beginning of the crisis... that while we fully support Israel's right to defend itself, how it does so matters," he wrote. "That means acting in a way that respects the rule of law and international humanitarian standards, and taking every possible precaution to protect civilian life." 
 Soon after his address, Mr Biden posted on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter: "American leadership is what holds the world together. Our alliances are what keep us safe. And our values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with."
 America would put all of that at risk if it walked away from Ukraine or turned its back on Israel, he warned.
 Poll results released by Quinnipiac University on Tuesday showed that 52 per cent of voters agree that America is getting it right in supporting Israel.
 The President also did relatively well over US support for Ukraine more than 1 1/2  years since Russia invaded the country -- the other major topic of his speech on Thursday. The Quinnipiac poll showed 47 per cent of voters approve of his response to the invasion, while 45 per cent disapprove. The numbers were encouraging for Mr Biden, who is seeking re-election just over a year from now.
 Mr Daniel Fried, a former US ambassador to Poland and distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank, said: "This was a speech to rally US support for an internationalist agenda.
 "He asserted... that US interests and US values are interwoven," he wrote on the think-tank's website. 
 Mr Sarang Shidore, director of the Global South Programme at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, told The Straits Times: "The speech was an unabashed case for American primacy. The melding of two rather separate conflicts (Gaza and Ukraine) into a seamless battle against the more abstract framings of tyranny and terror serves this goal."
 Some analysts questioned whether Mr Biden has underestimated the complexity of the Gaza situation.
 Dr Robert Manning, a former senior government official, told ST: "I fear Biden overreacted to the savage barbarism against Israel, a close democratic ally that he has long supported -- and underestimated the complexity of the situation.
 "I think there is too little thought about what next after Hamas," said Dr Manning, currently a distinguished senior fellow with the Reimagining US Grand Strategy project at the Stimson Centre, a Washington think-tank.
 Dr Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, told ST that Mr Biden's speech was "a solid articulation of US interests in these two major foreign policy crises".
 "The problem is, it comes from a defensive place. Biden is concerned that the United States isn't going to be able to provide leadership going forward, given domestic political dysfunction. US military support for Ukraine going forward is facing significant headwinds. 
 "Biden... doesn't want Israel to start a ground war that will lead to immense civilian casualties and consequent radicalisation -- but (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu is going to do it anyway."

Focus on calling for Mid-East conciliation and supporting aid efforts

Body


I refer to the article "Police, NParks will reject applications to hold public events relating to Israel-Hamas war" (Oct 18).
 I hope that, in Singapore, people who are not interested parties would focus on calling for negotiations and conciliation. This would go some way to temper the polarisation arising from anti-Semitic and Islamophobic sentiments circulating in some parts of the world.
 We are better together. This is the mindset that should guide us towards supporting restorative justice, not retributive justice, as the long-term solution for the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  
 As Singaporeans, we must think first of Singapore's interests, in terms of the cohesiveness we have built and maintained painstakingly over the years. 
 As founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew once said: "I do not want to sound like a hawk or a dove. If I have to choose a metaphor from the aviary, I would like to think of the owl." 
 The wisest thing Singaporeans can do now is to support humanitarian aid efforts for the casualties of the conflict.

Facing debt, most Thai workers in Israel choose to stay on despite war

BANGKOK  On the sun-baked tarmac of Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport last Thursday, Thailand's ambassador to Israel, Ms Pannabha Chandraramya, laid wreaths on eight coffins strapped onto baggage carts. 
 After a moment of silence, the bodies of these Thai nationals were loaded onto a plane to be sent home. They were the first of the 30 Thais killed in the attack by Hamas in the Gaza area that began on Oct 7. 
 Local media reported that they were sent to the provinces of Buriram, Udon Thani, Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Chaiyaphum, Si Sa Ket and Sukhothai. All but one are located in north-east Thailand, where poverty and debt push thousands of young men and women out of the country each year in search of better-paying work. 
 Since the Hamas attack and Israel's subsequent counter-offensive in the Gaza Strip, more than 8,000 Thais working in Israel have registered with their government to return home. 
 The Thai government has repatriated more than 1,400 so far, via a combination of commercial and military flights.
 But the numbers wanting to return home are dwarfed by those who are choosing to remain. 
 There were an estimated 30,000 Thais working in Israel before the war. They make up the vast majority of labourers in that country's agriculture sector through a decades-old arrangement that was formalised only in 2013 between the Thai and Israeli governments.
 This put many Thais on the front lines of the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Thais working in Israeli farms sited on land regarded by the Palestinians as stolen from them were swept up in the Hamas raids on Oct 7. 
 Thirty of them have been killed, making Thais account for the second-highest number of foreign nationals killed in the attack, after United States citizens. 
 Sixteen other Thais have been injured and 19 abducted by Hamas. 
 The exodus of Thai workers, along with the Israeli expulsion of Palestinian workers, has created a labour shortage on Israeli farms.
 Aid for Agriculture Workers, a group of civil society organisations, academics and other volunteers helping Thai workers in Israel during the war, said it is receiving more and more reports of migrant workers being compelled to return to work in the Gaza perimeter communities, and employers making it difficult for them to leave. 
 In one instance, it noted, the employers refused to open the electronically operated community gates, claiming they were observing the rules of the Shabbat -- the Jewish day of rest.
 "Although we empathise with the distress caused to farmers and farming communities by the labour shortage, no person should be forced to be where they feel unsafe," said Dr Yahel Kurlander, a sociologist from Israel's Tel Hai College and volunteer with Aid for Agriculture Workers. 
 "Now that the Thai embassy has declared it will be operating daily rescue flights, there is fear of increasing pressure on the workers to stay and work, including through unethical and illegal means."
 Still, in other parts of Israel farther away from the front lines, Thai workers are staying put.
 Mr Wuttichai Peung-ngu, 37, who has been working in the Na'an kibbutz in central Israel for 1 1/2  years, intends to serve out the full term of his five years and three months allowed under the system. 
 The single father from Ubon Ratchathani province used to work in a concrete factory in Thailand, but he struggled to support his parents and two children. He borrowed against his credit card, eventually amassing some 170,000 baht (S$6,400) in debt. 
 Enticed by the promise of a 50,000 baht monthly salary -- several times his basic pay of 15,000 baht in Thailand -- he decided to head to Israel. 
 To do that, he needed to borrow another 100,000 baht. He now has around 70,000 baht left to repay, and is confident he can do it in the next few months.
 "I feel safe here. This region is free from ground fighting," he said, while a military helicopter whirred overhead during his online interview with The Sunday Times. 
 In the past week, Israeli soldiers have turned up at the orchard where he works. "They just patrolled the area to check for any irregularities." 
 Over time, he has got used to the sound of rockets fired by Hamas and regularly intercepted in mid-air by Israel's missile defence system. "Only once or twice since I have arrived have the rockets dropped a distance from my farm."
 Asked what he would do should the war worsen, he said he would continue working. "I will take whatever comes. It's my choice."
 The shortage of Thai workers may give them more leverage to demand better treatment, noted Israeli anthropologist Matan Kaminer, who is also a volunteer with Aid for Agriculture Workers.
 "So far, they have been willing to accept not only the low wages and the hard work, but also the kind of invisibility that they have been condemned to as migrants in this country," he told ST. "Now there is this labour shortage, which gives them a little bit of leverage. I'm expecting we will see more defiance and assertive behaviour on the part of Thai migrants in Israel."
 For workers who have gone home, the Thai authorities are looking into ways to ease their financial distress. These include debt moratoriums and new jobs.
 Dr Sudarat Musikawong, a sociologist at Mahidol University, said the workers would need a combination of loan forbearance, debt forgiveness and subsidised jobs to survive.
 "There's debt incurred before they decide to go, and debt that happens because they go. And it accumulates. Imagine the pressure, if you have not paid off both forms of debt. The pressure to stay and find work is enormous," she told ST. "For the workers coming back, and if they haven't paid off their debt, they are going to be in extreme debt."
 Thailand, she added, "is not creating jobs at a wage that can sustain families for people who are working class, who may have only a primary or high-school education".
 According to data from the Bank of International Settlements, which is owned by 63 central banks, Thailand's household debt hit 91.6 per cent of its gross domestic product from January to March. This is among the highest in Asia. Singapore's figure, in contrast, stands at 48 per cent, and Malaysia's at 66.5 per cent.
 Returnees like Mr Phaithun Rakchat are making immediate plans for job placements in other countries. 
 The 37-year-old former mechanic went to Israel after his wife lost her job during the Covid-19 pandemic. With his 25,000 baht monthly salary in Thailand, he could hardly keep up with family expenses and the 20,000 baht monthly repayments for his home and car loans. 
 He worked on a farm near Ofakim in southern Israel for 11 months, earning about 60,000 baht a month, before Hamas attacked. Though he did not encounter any Hamas militants, he felt unsafe. 
 "Some workers were forced to work in the cabbage field, with bullets fired by the Israeli forces flying over their heads. Once, a rocket hit spots nearby. Work came to a stop," he told ST. 
 He returned to Thailand 80,000 baht in debt, and he is now eyeing jobs in Taiwan or South Korea.
 "Working in Thailand is not an option any more. Once you know the wages you can get elsewhere, you will not return."

Risk of wider war if Hezbollah joins Hamas in conflict

Byline: Jonathan Eyal Global, Risk of wider war if Hezbollah joins Hamas in conflict
Body


LONDON  Amid a growing danger of a confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah -- the Iranian proxy militia in Lebanon -- the current consensus is that neither Hezbollah nor its backers and bankrollers in Iran are interested in entering the Israel-Hamas war, despite issuing many blood-curdling threats against the Jewish state.
 But the snag is that all actors in the current showdown can stumble into a war that none wants.
 Either way, there is no question that Hezbollah's behaviour over the next few weeks will ultimately determine whether the current Gaza conflict remains contained or whether it morphs into a wider Middle Eastern war, perhaps even involving the US military in combat.
 Hezbollah -- or the Party of God -- is older and more powerful than Hamas, the Palestinian organisation that Israel is confronting in Gaza.
 Arguably the most critical armed Islamist movement in the Middle East currently, Hezbollah has a force of 20,000 fighters -- many highly trained and well armed -- which could be rapidly expanded by adding around 30,000 auxiliaries.
 The organisation's strongholds in southern Lebanon, on Israel's northern border, are massive fortifications of deep bunkers, tunnels and underground storage depots.
 Hezbollah's arsenals include an estimated 100,000 missiles and various other projectiles that can be fired at Israel and an array of increasingly sophisticated drones of multiple types.
 The organisation has hit Israel repeatedly in the past and fought the country to a standstill in 2006.
 Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps played a crucial role in establishing Hezbollah four decades ago, and the organisation remains the country's most significant regional proxy. 
 Relations between Hezbollah and Hamas have often been tense. The origins of Hamas are in the broader Sunni Muslim Brotherhood movement, while Hezbollah is a Shi'ite organisation inspired by the Iranian Revolution.
 But both outfits aim to destroy Israel and remove pro-Western Arab governments in the Middle East.
 And although there is no concrete evidence that Hezbollah was actively involved in Hamas' deadly blow against Israel on Oct 7, there is little doubt that the attack met several of Iran's objectives against Israel.
 By unleashing a war, Hamas succeeded in at least postponing a prospect of diplomatic relations being established between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the guardian of Islam's holiest sites. Such a Saudi-Israeli relationship, brokered by the US, would have been a significant setback for the Iranians.
 By striking Israel, Hamas has given prominence to what Iran likes to call the "Axis of Resistance", a spider's web of armed groups that the Islamic republic has against Israeli-US allies in the Middle East.
 These armed groups include Hezbollah in Lebanon, Yemen's Houthi rebels, units of the Popular Mobilisation in Iraq -- a network of militias mobilised initially to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria militants -- as well as the Afghan Liwa Fatemiyoun and the Pakistani Zainabiyoun, two paramilitary organisations formed with Shi'ite believers in these countries and used by Iran throughout the Middle East.
 Iran is determined to derive maximum political benefit from the current situation by claiming credit for the Hamas strike on Israel.
 Hamas has "made the Islamic community happy", Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has said, echoing most Iranian officials' congratulations heaped on Hamas.
 The question is whether the Iranians wish to move beyond words to deeds by encouraging Hezbollah to open another front from Lebanon while the bulk of the Israeli army is fighting in Gaza in the south.
 Israel has used informal channels to warn Iran and its proxies that should Hezbollah attack, the response would be devastating in Lebanon and elsewhere in Syria, where Iran has considerable assets.
 The US has also moved two aircraft carrier groups close to Israel's coast, a mighty force and an explicit warning to Iran to stay out of the conflict.
 The US and Israel have responded strongly to probing attacks by Iranian proxies.
 Over the past week, US forces have destroyed drones launched against military bases in Iraq housing American troops.
 Meanwhile, a US destroyer in the Red Sea shot down three surface-to-surface missiles and several drones launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen, another Iranian proxy.
 And Israel bombed targets around the Syrian capital of Damascus, hitting Iranian logistical supplies, as a foretaste of what the Israeli air force can do.
 For the moment, Iran's main objective is to prevent Israel's destruction of Hamas in Gaza by threatening an expansion of the war.
 Should Israel's Gaza operation continue, "the Axis of Resistance has the possibility of waging a long-term war with the enemy", warned Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian after returning from meeting Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon last week. 
 But the problem remains that the current pinpricks between Israel and Hezbollah can quickly deteriorate into an all-out war.
 And should this come about, US President Joe Biden may be forced to make good on his repeated promises to "have Israel's back" by using American air power against Iran's regional proxies.
 Nobody wishes for this outcome. However, the Middle East's history is full of war episodes nobody wanted or predicted.

Thousands gather at KL's Merdeka Square in solidarity with Palestine

KUALA LUMPUR  Thousands of Malaysians marched on Sunday -- the third such gathering in 10 days -- in a sign that the plight of Palestinians continues to resonate within the Muslim-majority country.
 The event was organised by humanitarian non-governmental organisations Viva Palestina Malaysia (VPM) and MyCare. Previously, there was a gathering at the National Mosque on Oct 13, and a march to the US embassy on Friday.
 At the Sunday gathering at Merdeka Square, Palestinian flags could be seen being waved across the field. Chants of "Free Palestine" could be heard, among others, accompanied by the sound of beating drums.
 The organisers had stressed that the gathering must be non-offensive and non-provocative. They asked those present to take down placards that personally insulted individuals, including Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 "Security, please take down those placards," VPM chairman Musa Mohd Nordin could be heard saying. "I don't care if this is your truth," he told an unnamed protestor.
 Observers estimated the crowd at around 10,000. According to Dr Musa, more than 20,000 people attended the event on Sunday. The highlight of the rally was a speech by former Permatang Pauh MP Nurul Izzah Anwar, daughter of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
 She criticised the Western powers, particularly the United States and Britain, for their support of the Israeli military, saying they did so despite the attacks on hospitals and churches in Gaza which resulted in the deaths of civilians, including children. 
 "This isn't about religion. Muslims and Christian Palestinians are being butchered. That's why we are encumbered to fight for the freedom of Palestine and return the moral compass to the world," said Ms Nurul Izzah.
 Mr Anwar has said that Malaysia does not agree with Western pressure to condemn Hamas. 
 "I said that we, as a policy, have a relationship with Hamas from before and this will continue," he said in Parliament on Oct 16. "As such, we don't agree with their pressuring attitude as Hamas won in Gaza freely through elections and Gazans chose them to lead."
 A day later, the Malaysian leader said it is crucial to prioritise the safety of all individuals affected by the conflict.
 Israel has launched a "total siege" of Gaza after an Oct 7 cross-border attack on southern Israel by Hamas militants. So far, around 6,000 Israelis and Palestinians have been killed.
 Speaking to reporters after the event, Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil said he is seeking advice from Malaysia's foreign ministry over allegations that social media platform TikTok has been taking down content with the word "Hamas", among others.
 He revealed that complaints have been lodged, and that one user's content was taken down a minute after it was uploaded on TikTok.

Israel-Hamas war plunges Palestinian Americans into vortex of fear

Byline: Nirmal Ghosh US, Israel-Hamas war plunges Palestinian Americans into vortex of fear
Body


WASHINGTON  Her voice firm yet shaking with emotion, Palestinian-American school principal Maysoon Awad, 54, could barely contain her anger. 
 "America is supporting Israel, and that's what makes us mad as American citizens," she told The Straits Times. 
 "We know that America always says it seeks justice, but we don't see any justice in this," she said, as friends around her unfurled a Palestinian flag. 
 Ms Awad was among several hundred protesters at the Washington Monument on Saturday demanding a ceasefire in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Alongside her was a friend, Ms Ayesha Kuhil, 72, who said she had family in Gaza and had not heard from them for three days. 
 Many in the Palestinian diaspora in the United States are deeply conflicted. The war is being broadcast in real time on the Internet -- amped up and often distorted by propaganda and disinformation.
 That has spilled over into the US, where Palestinian Americans and, more broadly, Arab Americans and Muslims, now face a new wave of Islamophobia. 
 Reports of Islamophobic language or incidents have come from across the country. Much of them are being fanned by right-wing politicians and media. 
 In its review of instances of Islamophobia, the journal HuffPost cited Mr Eric Bolling, a host at the conservative cable news company Newsmax, as saying that Palestinians are "addicted to violence" like an "addict is addicted to drugs". 
 Mr Dan Gainor, a freelance opinion editor at Fox News, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, called Palestinians and Arabs "barbarian pigs". 
 Others have attacked Muslim legislators. Somali American Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar, one of only two Muslim women in Congress -- the other is Ms Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, the lone Palestinian in Congress -- has been receiving death threats over the phone. 
 Mr Charles Kirk, president of the right-wing organisation Turning Point USA, which has promoted Christian nationalism, referred to Ms Omar as "an active threat to the United States". 
 Ms Tlaib has been called a "terrorist sympathiser" by Republican congresswoman and Donald Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene. 
 The war has reverberated through university campuses as well, filling social media feeds with scenes of outrage. 
 In one case, an elite law firm reportedly revoked job offers to three Ivy League students from the universities of Harvard and Columbia who had signed a letter expressing support for Palestinians that blamed Israel for the Hamas attacks. 
 Anti-Semitism, not far below the surface in the country, has also risen on the back of the war in the Middle East. Much of this, wrote Jewish writer Michael Cohen, a fellow with the Eurasia Group Foundation, in an Oct 21 column for MSNBC, is an "age-old anti-semitic trope that Jews are responsible for their own suffering".
 Former journalist and author Sanford J. Ungar, director of the Free Speech Project at Georgetown University, in an e-mail to ST, said: "On college and university campuses... nearly everyone has by now taken a side in the seemingly endless, symbolic Middle East struggle, and the feelings run very high; nuances have been dropped.
 "Professors are being scrutinised in the classroom for alleged bias, and volatile accusations are being exchanged among students." 
 The best that university administrators can hope for, he added, is to get deeply polarised groups together for civil conversation about their differences.
 Ms Rania Mustafa, New Jersey-based executive director at the non-profit Palestinian American Community Centre, noted "a really deep fear running in our community".
 The centre advocates for the cause of Palestine, and supports and counsels the Palestinian community, among other activities.
 Palestinians are struggling to humanise themselves against the trope of radical Islamic militant groups, she told ST. The broader Arab and Muslim community is being stained as well, she said.
 "These tropes are hurting (the communities) and taking away from what I think is the root cause of all of this, the Israeli occupation of Palestine. It's kind of flipping the script, painting the oppressor as the victim, rather than as the oppressor. It's a difficult time for all Palestinians."
 She added: "Americans that identify as Muslim, Palestinian or Arab are getting the brunt of it and people don't understand some of the nuances or don't understand the context or the history.
 "They're just seeing that there's this evil thing that's out there that's coming out of Islamic radicalism, and are painting a huge group of people to be part of that -- and we are the ones who are paying the price."
 Palestinian Americans number around 200,000 to 400,000 -- part of a 3.7 million-strong Arab American population. New Jersey has one of the largest Palestinian populations in the country. 
 The current crisis comes just as US public opinion has become "modestly more positive towards both sides in the Israel-Palestinian conflict", according to a 2022 Pew Research Centre survey. 
 Overall, Americans continued to express more positive feelings towards Israelis than towards Palestinians -- and to rate the Israeli government more favourably than the Palestinian government, Pew found. 
 But there was a difference between older and younger people. Adults under 30 viewed Palestinians at least as warmly (61 per cent very or somewhat favourable) as Israelis (56 per cent), Pew found. 
 "There's a lot of invigorated pro-Palestinian solidarity in the US, not just from the Palestinian American diaspora, but from allies across the spectrum," said Mr Tariq Kenney-Shawa, a New York-based US Policy Fellow at a Palestinian policy think tank called Al-Shabaka. 
 "But there's this reinvigorated hatred that I believe has roots back in the post 9/11 years and that led up to the (2003) Iraq -- and these two strands are definitely clashing," he noted. 
 "We have people showing their faces and proudly saying, kill all Palestinians. And nothing, nothing is happening to them."

Protection of civilians, more aid needed to prevent catastrophe in Gaza: President Tharman

Byline: Zhaki Abdullah, Protection of civilians, more aid needed to prevent catastrophe in Gaza: President Tharman
Body


  The most pressing priority amid the Israel-Hamas war is the protection of civilian lives and allowing "vastly larger amounts" of humanitarian aid to enter Gaza to prevent catastrophe, said President Tharman Shanmugaratnam. 
 "The most important start is to protect innocent civilians in the weeks and months to come, and avoid collective punishment of a whole population," he wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday. 
 This is not just because of the requirements of international law or compelling humanitarian reasons, said Mr Tharman. 
 "But because each round of extremism and violence against innocent people will harden hearts, and create new enemies. 
 "It risks broadening the conflict in the region. And it makes it more difficult to find a path to a future of peace, a future of hope for the young."
 Mr Tharman's comments come after 20 aid trucks were allowed into southern Gaza last Saturday, the first convoy of humanitarian supplies since the war began on Oct 7 when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel and killed at least 1,400 people.
 In retaliation, Israel declared a "state of war" and launched strikes on Gaza -- killing at least 4,700 so far -- while imposing a blockade on the densely populated enclave.
 In his post, Mr Tharman pointed to the trauma felt by Israelis following the Hamas assault -- the deadliest such attack since Israel was founded -- noting the repeated pogroms against Jews throughout history.
 He also noted the "trauma and desperation" faced by Palestinians, pointing to both the 16-year Israeli siege of Gaza and the illegal encroachment by armed Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
 However, this complex history, as well as the grief experienced by Israelis and Palestinians, does not justify the indiscriminate taking of civilian lives on either side, he added. 
 "It offends basic human morality, and flouts international law," he said. 
 Mr Tharman reiterated Singapore's stance that a durable and just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be achieved only through a negotiated two-state solution, in line with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. 
 "It must enable Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace and security, and with dignity," he said. 
 "The condolence letters that PM Lee and I sent to our counterparts in the Palestinian Authority expressed hope that all sides will find a way to work towards this critical goal. It will take time. But it can be achieved, with the support and commitment of other international parties," he wrote. 
 "Anyone with a sense of reality knows that the cycle of violence will keep repeating itself until a permanent political solution is found for Israel and the Palestinians to co-exist as neighbouring states, with hard assurances for each other's security."
 In a statement on Saturday, five United Nations agencies -- including the Development Programme, Children's Fund and World Food Programme -- described the situation in Gaza as "catastrophic". 
 Mr Tharman joined members of the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO) on Sunday morning to pray for peace in the Middle East at the Harmony in Diversity Gallery, National Development Ministry Building, in Maxwell Road.
 About 80 faith leaders and members of Singapore's oldest inter-faith body, including from the local Jewish community, observed a collective prayer for the peace and safety of civilians in Israel and Gaza, including those being held hostage.
 Speaking at the event, IRO president Noor Marican noted that the conflict has affected the lives of innocent individuals and communities. "We come together today to offer our prayers with the hope of a better future, and recognise the sanctity of human life and fundamental dignity of individuals and communities," he said. 
 Following the prayer, Mr Tharman spoke to faith leaders at a closed-door dialogue. 
 "We had a good dialogue, reaffirming the inter-faith understanding and harmony that must be preserved in Singapore, even as we pray and hope for peace and stability in the Middle East," he said on Facebook. 
 "Long may we remain a peaceful, multi-religious and multiracial nation, with true respect for each of our communities."
 During an official visit to Saudi Arabia, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told reporters last Friday that Parliament will debate Singapore's position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the next sitting in early November. 
 Several MPs have already filed parliamentary questions on the situation. 
 Stressing Singapore's position on the two-state solution, PM Lee said that both Palestinians and Israelis could not afford to give up on this aspiration.
 He said: "Unless you can make progress in that direction, you are doomed to generations of bloodshed and tragedy. And I don't think either side really wants that."

Crypto's role in terrorist financing

Byline: , Crypto's role in terrorist financing
Body


LONDON  Cryptocurrency's role in terrorist financing and funding militant groups has come under renewed scrutiny following a deadly attack in Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas. 
 Israel has seized crypto accounts it says are linked to Hamas. United States lawmakers have urged the government to crack down on the use of cryptocurrencies by Hamas and its affiliates.
 But cryptocurrencies are just one way that violent militant groups, and groups designated as terrorist organisations, get and use money. Here's what we know about crypto's role.
 Why is crypto used in illicit finance'Anyone can set up a cryptocurrency wallet address without always having to undergo checks such as those by a bank.
 The addresses are pseudonymous -- labelled only by a string of letters and numbers -- which means people can send and receive cryptocurrency without revealing their identity.
 The blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrency operates digitally and across borders, meaning that it can act as an instant payment system.
 Crypto is subject globally to less specific regulation than traditional finance, although new rules are being introduced in some regions.
 The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global body responsible for tackling money laundering and terrorist financing, has warned that crypto assets "risk becoming a safe haven for the financial transactions of criminals and terrorists". 
 Can crypto not be tracked'Yes. But not always.
 Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum create a permanent public record of transactions. This means it is possible to see what funds have flowed in and out of a wallet address, and which wallets it interacted with.
 It is hard for an outsider to identify transactions on the blockchain, but blockchain analytics firms have tools to track funds.
 Still, in order to link these flows to a person or group, researchers rely on information not recorded by the blockchain.
 Crypto exchanges can record which addresses belong to which customer, and police can unmask those behind wallets.
 Cryptocurrency users can further obscure their tracks by the use of crypto "mixers", or move funds to exchanges or other firms where the funds can become difficult to distinguish from other customers' assets.
 How much crypto has been used in terrorist financing'No one knows for sure.
 Militant groups use different methods to move money, including cash, banks, shell companies and charities, and informal financial networks. Crypto is a small part, experts say.
 A United Nations official said in 2022 that a couple of years ago, 5 per cent of terrorist attacks were considered to be financed by crypto, but that this may go up to 20 per cent, Bloomberg reported.
 The FATF said in 2023 that crypto presents "increasing terrorist financing risks", but noted that the "vast majority" of terrorist financing still uses regular money.
 When illicit finance flows are identified at a crypto firm, that does not necessarily mean all of that firm's flows are tainted, blockchain research company Chainalysis said in a blog.
 Chainalysis said that terrorist financing "represents a small fraction of the less than 1 per cent of the entire crypto market occupied by illicit activity".
 Crypto crime hit a record US$20.1 billion (S$27.6 billion) in 2022, Chainalysis said, calling this a lower-bound estimate. This figure excludes instances when cryptocurrencies are the proceeds of non-crypto crimes such as payment for drugs. Cryptocurrency theft via cyber attacks is also a significant source of funding for North Korea, according to UN reports.
 Some banks in Britain have curbed customers' access to crypto because of a rise in crypto scams. REUTERS

Is the US still the 'indispensable' power?

Byline: Jonathan Eyal Global, Is the US still the 'indispensable' power?
Body


United States presidents usually give speeches from the Oval Office only at critical moments in their nation's life.
 Such a moment came for Mr Joe Biden last Thursday when, for only the second time in his presidency, he addressed the American people at what he called "an inflexion point in history, one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come".
 The immediate reason for the speech was the President's need to persuade ordinary Americans and, through them, members of the US Congress that the country should provide a total of around US$100 billion (S$137 billion) in financial and military assistance to Israel's war against the Hamas militant organisation in Gaza, and to Ukraine's 18-month-old war against invading Russian forces.
 But the speech was not just about money; it was primarily about how Mr Biden sees the US as a leader and the primary shaper of a world currently undergoing profound change.
 The US, he claimed, remains "the essential" and even the "indispensable nation" that "holds the world together". And in the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, America and its Western allies face similar, mortal threats to their security. Allow America's enemies in both conflicts to win the current battles, and the prosperous world the US helped put together at the end of World War II would be gone, Mr Biden suggested.
 The US President is not proposing to send American troops to these wars. Indeed, US "boots on the ground" is what Mr Biden explicitly ruled out. But he views US leadership of various alliances as the essential glue that holds the world together.
 And that's not because the US is charitable; it is because of national necessity: "American alliances are what keep us, America, safe. American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with," he said.
 Of course, all US presidents like to invoke their country's importance and supposed global mission.
 Lessons from Ukraine, GazaStill, there is no question that at this critical moment when America's global influence is being challenged, Mr Biden's latest speech and his determination to reassert US superiority are significant. Nor is there much doubt that his words last week will define his presidency. The real question is whether the US is still capable and willing to exercise the global leadership its President is so determined to uphold.
 Is the US still the "indispensable" power? The lessons from the two big conflicts confronting the world -- Ukraine, Europe's biggest war in 80 years, and Israel's war in Gaza, in response to the biggest attack on the Jewish state in just as long -- suggest the answer is still affirmative.
 In Ukraine, it was the US that first raised the alarm about Russia's preparations for war, although many countries dismissed these US warnings as either an invention or an exaggeration. But the US intelligence was not merely correct; it was even able to predict the very day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
 The US did more than warn and put together a coalition of around 50 Western-leaning nations that continues to stand up to Russian aggression; it also defined the purpose and nature of the war that followed. Mr Biden decided that Ukraine should get all necessary military assistance, apart from weapons that could hit deep into Russia's territory.
 It meant Russia's bid to take over another country for no reason other than President Vladimir Putin's imperial aspirations failed. But the checkmating of Russia did not turn into a catastrophic and potentially nuclear showdown with the US.
 The argument that the US President and his advisers make -- that Russia's failure in Ukraine would discourage China from attempting a military takeover of Taiwan -- remains debatable. What is beyond debate, however, is that Russia's rebuff has significant consequences for global security and that none of this would have been achieved without the US taking a leadership role.
 The same applies to the current conflict in the Middle East. The US may be criticised for its unstinting support for Israel and its apparent indifference to the plight of the Palestinians. But what have Russia or China done in handling the current conflict, apart from repeating appeals for "peace" and a "Palestinian-Israeli settlement"'
 It was the US that, over the past few days, prevailed on Israel to allow some humanitarian convoys into Gaza. The US delayed the Israeli land offensive over two weeks in response to the Hamas attack by persuading Israel's government that the desire for revenge is not a reasonable basis for military action. And it is only the might of the US that is preventing Iran from transforming the Israel-Gaza showdown into a regional war.
 None of this was achieved because the US sought more influence in the Middle East. Indeed, President Biden came to power determined to downgrade America's Middle East entanglements. Yet, to paraphrase the adage, America may not be interested in the Middle East, but the Middle East remains interested in America. 
 American capabilitiesIs the US capable of exercising its global responsibilities? 
 Again, the prevailing and fashionable explanation is that the US is in decline and is, therefore, no longer able to shoulder the duties of a superpower. And yet again, the explanation is misconceived.
 For the first time since the early 1950s, the US faces significant opponents in both Europe and Asia. For the first time in our lifetime, the US must contend with a power like China, a mighty nation combining economic power and an increasingly sophisticated military, something the Soviet Union never did.
 And yet, statistics tell a different tale. In the "unipolar moment" of the early 1990s, with the Soviet Union gone and the US widely acknowledged as the world's only remaining superpower, America's economy accounted for 26 per cent of the world economy. 
 And today? The US accounts for 24 per cent of the world economy. The actual decline did not occur in the US but in Europe: In the early 1990s, the Europeans' share of the global economy was similar to that of the US, but today is around half that amount. Of course, that impacts the West's relative power, but the US decline is not the chief culprit here.
 Furthermore, although Americans fret about the growth in China's arsenals, the fact remains that the US spends more on defence than the next 10 countries combined, including Britain and China.
 The US has 11 large nuclear-powered fleet carriers -- carrying around 80 fighter jets each; their combined deck space is more than double that of all other aircraft carrier-owner nations combined. 
 So, while the Chinese now have more surface ships than the US Navy, only the man currently sitting in the Oval Office of the White House has the luxury of sending two aircraft carrier groups near the shores of Israel -- as he has done over the past few weeks -- while still commanding much of the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans, as well as the waters of the Gulf.
 Political willWhat about the will of the US to uphold its global position? Ordinary Americans are tired of "fixing other people's problems", as many see matters. The US is also experiencing a curious reversal of political roles, with Democrats, who used to be wedded to domestic agendas, now more interested in foreign and security affairs, while the Republicans, hitherto the more assertive on the global arena, now opposing funding for Ukraine.
 Because of this topsy-turvy world, America's current foreign policy twists are similar to a "journey through the looking glass", complains Mr Peter Wehner, a former speechwriter for three Republican presidential administrations.
 And while everyone acknowledges President Biden's commitment to America's alliances, "both friends and adversaries wonder whether Biden's engagement and alliance-building is a return to normal or whether (Donald) Trump's 'America First' disdain for allies will be the dominant thread in American policy in the future", notes former US defence secretary Robert Gates in an article in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs.
 Yet it's worth recalling that the US periodically experiences bouts of isolationism, which seemed irreversible to those alive at the time but now are viewed as irrelevant. The US initially stood aloof from both world wars. And most US presidents campaigned on platforms promising to concentrate on domestic affairs. "It's the economy, stupid" was the electoral slogan of Mr Bill Clinton at the height of America's post-Cold War dominance; soon after he won the White House, he had to dispatch US air power and troops to extricate the Europeans from a bloody war in the former Yugoslavia.
 Is the current isolationist mood worse than the one prevailing in the mid-1970s, when the US abandoned Vietnam and youngsters in the US refused the draft for military service? Just seven years after almost everyone pronounced the end of US global dominance, Mr Ronald Reagan presided over the most significant jump in US defence expenditure and the end of the Soviet Union.
 Perhaps Trump's isolationist mood is worse than that of his predecessors. But it should not be forgotten that Trump's opposition to China -- which seemed outlandish when "The Donald" was first elected -- is now just about the only bipartisan foreign policy question in Washington. And Trump was hardly an isolationist when it came to the Middle East, and Israel in particular.
 Besides, a poll released by Quinnipiac -- an academic US pollster -- last week revealed that nearly two-thirds of American voters support the view that helping Ukraine to fight against Russia is in America's national interest, and more than three-quarters of the respondents in the same poll felt that way about supporting Israel. In short, isolationism may be just skin-deep, as it has been throughout the US' history.
 That does not mean President Biden's international security agenda is trouble-free. The President's attempt to "hold the world together" by making a connection between Israel and Ukraine -- two conflicts 2,000km apart and involving very different opponents -- as vital to America's national security remains risky.
 For it is much more difficult for the US to uphold its system of global alliances if it lumps all its perceived threats together: While America's European allies see eye to eye over Russia, they have very different perspectives on the Middle East or, indeed, China. Still, Mr Biden's determination to persuade his electorate that America's leadership carries benefits and responsibilities could be successful.
 And, as Winston Churchill, Britain's leader during World War II, once famously observed: "The Americans will always do the right thing, only after they have tried everything else."

I appreciate Singapore's principled stand in support of peace and its concern for civilians on all sides in the midst of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war (Protection of civilians, more aid needed to prevent catastrophe in Gaza: President Tharman, Oct 22). 
 For 14 months between 2018 and 2019, I lived in Jerusalem. I wrote my master's thesis on the 2014 Gaza conflict, which the 2023 conflict is beginning to share many similarities with. 
 The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the most intractable in the world, and the worst case of identity politics I have ever seen. 
 I spoke with Israelis and Palestinians when I travelled through Israel and the West Bank. I frequently found that each side saw the conflict in binary terms, as a struggle of "us versus them", of "good guys" versus "bad guys".  
 A 2014 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal called this phenomenon "motive attribution asymmetry". Each side sees its own group as motivated by love, while seeing the other side as motivated by hate. 
 What I learnt from my conversations was that both Israelis and Palestinians have their own narratives of exile, marginalisation, discrimination, violence and loss. They were speaking about the conflict through the lens of their deep pain, and it was impossible not to feel their anguish. 
 The experience taught me to reject an "us versus them" mentality, and instead to see the common humanity in all people, with all the complexities of human nature. 
 Thus, it is heartening to see how Jews, Muslims and people of other faiths in Singapore have modelled this same commitment. 
 At the recent Inter-Religious Organisation event, they transcended their different beliefs to affirm a common desire for peace in the Middle East, and to also pray for the peace and safety of civilians in Israel and Gaza, including those being held hostage.  
 The challenge of the Middle East conflict calls on us to bring out the best of ourselves to deal with the worst impulses of human nature.  
 Both Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in peace and security. We must continue to reject all forms of violence against civilians and strive for peaceful coexistence, or else many more precious lives will continue to be lost.

Don't forget the war in Ukraine

The heinous terrorist attack on Israel carried out by Hamas and the grievous repercussions for Palestinian lives and property in Gaza caused by Israel's air strikes have understandably focused the world's attention on the future of the Middle East. While Hamas must be punished militarily and decisively for its barbaric incursion into Israel, it is equally true that the Palestinians, too, have a right to live free of the collective punishment of a whole population because of the crimes of Hamas. Hence, there is no doubt that the international community should insist on the protection of civilian lives and on allowing sufficient humanitarian aid to enter besieged Gaza. The enclave must not become the latest symbol of the intractable nature of conflicts in the Middle East, where violence begets violence in a generational cycle that recedes from view for a while, only to reappear with almost biological vengeance later. The Middle East is too important to the rest of the world to be left to the mercy of its history.
 However, Ukraine deserves to be kept firmly in the global view as well. Much as Hamas has unsettled regional relations by breaching Israel's borders, Russia attacked the entire post-Cold War European (and international) order by invading Ukraine in 2022. If copied by other ambitious nations, the Russian assertion that might equals right in relations between great powers and their weaker neighbours would destroy the very basis of an international order founded on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, and on the operations of international law. The international diplomatic resistance to the Russian invasion of Ukraine is based on this fundamental truth. That resistance must not be overshadowed by the violence in the Middle East -- although condemnable -- or made an extension of the behaviour of major powers in the region. 
 For example, the United States -- a prominent player in both Europe and the Middle East -- may have compromised its international credibility in rallying support for Ukraine by recently blocking United Nations action to protect Gazan civilians. While one reason for the American diplomatic position was the desire to uphold Israel's undeniable right of self-defence, there are concerns that Washington might have forfeited some of the global dividends that it had gained by isolating Moscow in the UN General Assembly over Ukraine.
 While the Ukraine conflict cannot be kept separate from other wars, the tough conditions under which Ukrainians are labouring in an invasion whose reversal is nowhere in sight must not be allowed to fade from global view. To do so would be to hand Russia the upper hand in diplomatic attempts to resolve the crisis. That would harm Ukrainians, and not help Gazans either.

Israel-Hamas war unlikely to make a dent in US' strategic position in Asia-Pacific

Byline: Denny Roy, Israel-Hamas war unlikely to make a dent in US' strategic position in Asia-Pacific
Body


Washington has been trying to prioritise Asia in the US' grand strategy since the George H.W. Bush administration more than 30 years ago, but conflicts in other places keep obstructing that plan. The latest complication is the Israel-Hamas conflict stemming from Hamas' murder and kidnapping of hundreds of Israelis on Oct 7.
 With US President Joe Biden reiterating staunch support for Israel, the flare-up in the Middle East potentially affects US strategic leadership in the Asia-Pacific region in several ways.
 There is a danger that Israel's fight could siphon significant US capabilities or influence out of the Asia-Pacific. 
 This, however, is unlikely.
 No new US warThis war will not draw in a major US commitment as the Afghanistan and Iraq wars did. There is no US appetite for another Middle East campaign. The country is still war-weary from the long US military occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. Memories of the chaotic and humiliating US exit from Afghanistan only two years ago are still fresh. 
 Americans would certainly not support a US campaign to invade Iran. Even short of that, any large diversion of US military might to fight a war against Iran is difficult to imagine under almost any circumstances. 
 For Teheran's part, Iranian proxies might continue to harass US troops in Iraq and Syria, but Iran's government has incentives to avoid a war with the US. Iran benefited from recent US concessions that were part of a nascent de-escalation process. The Iranian regime hopes to get access to US$6 billion (S$8.2 billion) in assets, held in escrow by Qatar and on hold pending an investigation into Iran's role in the Oct 7 attacks. 
 Hamas is Arab and Sunni, while Iran is Persian and Shi'ite. While Iran and Hamas have Israel as a common enemy, it is uncertain that this is enough to motivate Iran to enter the fight on Hamas' behalf and suffer the expected US retaliation. 
 Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah will likely be cautious about doing more than firing a few missiles into Israel. Although the Iranian-backed militia has a large stock of missiles, depleting this stash would reduce Hezbollah's leverage -- based on the threat that it might launch more missiles -- and would take years to replenish. Welcoming a major war with Israel could also severely damage Hezbollah's political standing within Lebanon by bringing more disaster upon the country with no guarantee that other Arab states or Iran would help Lebanon rebuild afterwards.
 The 'distraction' argumentMany experts argue that opportunistic US adversaries will act more aggressively because of the Israel-Hamas war. Among them is Chatham House international affairs analyst Keir Giles, who warns that Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un "can use this opportunity to probe, test and attack" the US and its allies on other fronts while Washington is "distracted" by the eruption of hostilities in the Middle East.
 The "distraction" argument, however, is overrated. The United States has ample bureaucratic capacity to simultaneously assess and react to crises in all parts of the globe. Of course, the President himself has limited mental bandwidth, but this does not mean the US government could not respond to multiple crises. Rather, it means Mr Biden could not devote his own full attention to all of them, but would instead rely more heavily on the policy advice of separate groups of US government advisors. US regional military commanders already have plans and forces in place to address new contingencies.
 Some observers fear Beijing will take advantage of a "preoccupied" US to move against Taiwan, either by seizing one of the small islands that Taiwan controls or by imposing a blockade of Taiwan's seaports. 
 This fear, however, erroneously assumes that China has already decided to seize Taiwan by military means and is merely waiting for an opportune moment to strike. It is far more likely that the Chinese government sees a Taiwan Strait war as a desperate last resort that has not yet proven necessary. Actions by Taipei and Washington, not actors in the Middle East, will drive Beijing's decision-making.
 The possible drain on US resources is an important question, but Israel can conduct its own war with minimal help from the US. America gives Ukraine High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, 155mm shells, artillery guns and Javelin anti-tank missiles. Taiwan needs Javelins and the Army Tactical Missile System. Israel doesn't need supplies of these weapons from the US.
 Based on Israel's initial request to Washington, Israeli needs for prosecuting the war against Hamas will not conflict with the wish lists of Ukraine and Taiwan. The resources Israel needs will not starve either US assistance to Ukraine or US efforts to prepare for a possible future war in the Asia-Pacific region. Admiral John Aquilino, commander of US forces in Asia and the Pacific, said on Oct 17 that he has not had "one piece of equipment or force structure depart" from his theatre as a result of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
 Leadership rivalry with ChinaThe Israel-Hamas war impacts the US-China competition for global leadership. Post-colonial and developing countries are generally siding with the Palestinians. In contrast, the US was the only United Nations Security Council member to vote "no" on an Oct 18 resolution calling for a humanitarian pause in the conflict. (The US delegation objected that the resolution did not mention Israel's right to self-defence.) The conflict therefore affords China an opportunity to reinforce its credentials as the leader of the Global South. But this is not necessarily a clear win for China.
 Washington's influence in the Middle East is not fatally weakened. US intervention delayed the expected Israeli ground assault into Gaza, something no other country could have achieved. Even as it is criticised by pro-Palestinian groups for supporting Israeli "colonialism", the US government quickly announced aid to Palestinians and persuaded Egypt to open aid delivery into Gaza.
 The Israel-Hamas conflict sidelines the US effort to broker a normalisation of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, as the Saudi government is forced to demonstrate solidarity with the Palestinians, but probably only temporarily. Negotiations will likely resume after the conflict dies down. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appears driven to reduce tensions in the region to clear the way for realising his grand national economic development plans. 
 Beijing drew international criticism for its position on the Ukraine war. The Chinese government declined to condemn Russia's aggression, sought recognition as a mediator while advocating a solution favourable to Russia at Ukraine's expense, and blamed the war on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
 Similarly, in this case, in addition to repeating the usual "call on relevant parties to remain calm, exercise restraint and immediately end the hostilities", Chinese officials declined to mention Hamas by name or to use the term "terrorism". (In contrast to Israel and several Western countries, China does not officially designate Hamas a terrorist organisation.) 
 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi blamed Israel, saying "the crux of the matter is that justice has not been done to the Palestinian people". Chinese government-owned media have more broadly blamed the US for conflict in the Middle East, fitting this case into Beijing's larger narrative. All of these statements will please China's Muslim-majority partner states, but China's response thus far demonstrates no useful or concrete crisis management. 
 Siding with the pro-Palestinian governments also damages China's relations with Israel, which Beijing considers an important partner country. Israelis are aware that anti-Semitic comments filled Chinese social media after the Oct 7 attacks. The Asia-Pacific director in Israel's Foreign Ministry expressed "deep disappointment" with China's statements about the attacks.
 A problem for Ukraine, not Taiwan The Israel-Hamas conflict does not directly endanger Taiwan. US funding to assist Israel is not in competition with US funding to help defend Taiwan or other Asia-Pacific states against possible Chinese aggression. There is broad political support for both. One of the very few bipartisan issues in US politics is agreement on the need to resist Chinese attempts to forcibly change what Washington considers to be the status quo in Asia, including Taiwan being free to define its own relationship with China. Rather, the country that is in danger of losing US support is Ukraine.
 The assent of both Houses of Congress is necessary to pass legislation, and the opposition Republican Party narrowly controls the House of Representatives. The Republican Party itself is divided on providing arms for Ukraine. Traditional Republicans support it, but the far-right wing associated with multiply indicted former president Donald Trump is opposed. Their opposition appears to be a manifestation of deference towards Trump's isolationism and admiration for Mr Putin.
 After Hamas' murderous incursion, at least one Trump-affiliated senator proposed redirecting US aid approved for Ukraine to Israel. Other Republican politicians have called for diverting the Ukraine money to Taiwan. 
 Last Thursday, President Biden called on the US Congress to approve a request for more than US$100 billion, including US$60 billion for Ukraine, US$14 billion for Israel, and US$7 billion in security assistance for Taiwan and other Asia-Pacific countries, along with US$14 billion to improve policing along the US southern border. The money for Israel, Taiwan and border security is sugar-coating for the Ukraine money.
 The real challenges There are two challenges to US leadership in the Asia-Pacific region that are far more serious than the Israel-Hamas war.
 The first is dysfunction in US domestic politics. While there is currently stable US support for an internationalist foreign policy and particularly for American alliances in the Asia-Pacific region, the impact of Trump's personal attitude towards Ukraine has demonstrated how a major US foreign policy orientation can turn surprisingly quickly for reasons that are not necessarily rooted in sound strategy.
 Trump, who is the front runner to be the Republican Party's candidate for the 2024 presidential election, has also been outspokenly critical of US alliances, particularly those with Japan and South Korea. They could be in jeopardy with Trump himself or a Trump-like politician in the White House.
 The dysfunction is also procedural. Congress has been unable to pass legislation for three weeks and counting due to the Republican Party's inability to agree on who should be Speaker of the House. Among other things, this holds up foreign assistance packages.
 Another serious challenge to the US retaining its regional leadership position is the weakness of the US defence industrial base. The Ukraine war and the effort to keep up with China's military expansion have exposed an inability of US military production to meet the demands of America's global commitments. 
 This weakness reflects years of privatisation, consolidation and offshoring. Taiwan is now waiting for US$18 billion in purchased US arms, including Stinger and Harpoon missiles. China now has over 200 times America's shipbuilding capacity.
 Israel won't pull the US from leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. But the latest war serves as a reminder that the cost of global leadership is high, and that Washington is not investing sufficiently.

S&P lowers Israel's credit outlook to negative, citing war risks

Byline: , S&P lowers Israel's credit outlook to negative, citing war risks
Body


WASHINGTON  S&P Global Ratings said on Tuesday it is lowering Israel's credit outlook from stable to negative, citing risks that the Israel-Hamas conflict could broaden, with a more pronounced impact on the economy. 
 "The negative outlook reflects the risk that the Israel-Hamas war could spread more widely or affect Israel's credit metrics more negatively than we expect," the credit rating agency said in a notice. "We currently assume the conflict will remain centred in Gaza and last no more than three to six months." 
 On Oct 7, Hamas gunmen stormed across the border from Gaza into Israel, killing at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. More than 5,700 Palestinians, also mostly civilians, have been killed across the Gaza Strip in retaliatory Israeli bombardments, the territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry said. 
 On Tuesday, S&P said it revised the outlook for its "AA-" long-term foreign and local currency ratings on Israel to negative. 
 S&P's decision comes less than a week after another rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, put the Israeli government's A1 credit ratings on review for downgrade, pointing to the "unexpected and violent conflict between Israel and Hamas". 
 Fitch Ratings has also announced that it is placing Israel's A+ foreign and local currency issuer default ratings on negative watch over risks from the conflict. 
 S&P said it expects Israel's economy to contract by 5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with the third, before rebounding in early 2024. This comes from security-related disruptions and reduced business activity, alongside the drafting of reservists and other factors such as a confidence shock. 
 Added budgetary measures to help households and businesses, on top of a rise in defence spending, are also expected to raise the government deficit, said S&P. 
 S&P added that should the conflict widen "materially", it could cut ratings on the country. AFP

ISD protects public space to allow S'pore's democratic process to function: PM Lee

Countries have to defend themselves against all sorts of threats, and it would be gullible to think that everyone wishes Singapore well, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday.
 He noted that the country faces dangers on two fronts. From abroad, Singapore can be targeted by foreign influence operations and covert activities, while domestically, vulnerabilities and fault lines need to be managed.
 While it is necessary for a country to have leaders with great ideas to inspire people to work hard and unite behind a common cause, this is not enough to ensure progress and prosperity, PM Lee said at a dinner to mark the Internal Security Department's (ISD) 75th anniversary.
 Real life is more complicated, and nation-building is not "all sweetness and light", he said.
 "While we must not be paranoid and see shadows behind every corner, neither should we be naive about the real threats to an open and stable society," he added. "It is therefore critical for the government to stay well informed about such threats, and be equipped to deal with them."
 Speaking to past and present ISD officers at the dinner, held at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore, PM Lee said the department plays a crucial role in providing the Government with timely information and insightful assessments beyond what is in the public domain.
 PM Lee said to the officers at the closed-door event, in a speech released on Wednesday: "You are our eyes and ears on the ground, keeping in touch with all these various groups. You watch the trends vigilantly, and when problems threaten to grow serious, nip them in the bud before they can get out of hand.
 "In essence, you protect the public space for the proper and successful functioning of Singapore's democratic process."
 While Singapore has come a long way in building trust between its different communities since independence, it would be unwise to imagine that differences in perspectives have entirely disappeared, he said.
 One only has to look at recent developments to see that such differences still exist and can cause friction and serious problems if not properly handled, he added.
 He listed US-China tensions and violence in the Middle East as examples of issues that have caused strong reactions among Singaporeans of different age groups or religious beliefs.
 "On the US-China tensions, Chinese Singaporeans, especially the older ones, tend to have different views compared with other Singaporeans. Every time conflict and violence flare up in the Middle East, passions get roused... in South-east Asia, and to some extent in Singapore too," PM Lee said. 
 "The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict is an especially emotive issue for Muslim Singaporeans, who empathise strongly with the plight of the Palestinian population, just like Muslim communities worldwide. And on the other side, certain segments of our Jewish and Christian communities get worked up too."
 He added: "All these differences are a reality that we must recognise and accept." 
 The threat of terrorism, which springs from the broader security situation in the region, also continues to be a security issue for Singapore, he noted.
 While it has been 22 years since the 9/11 attacks in New York, the threat from transnational Islamist terrorist groups remains persistent, and they continue to operate in nearby countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines, he said.
 These groups are employing new strategies for recruitment and fund-raising, and have developed novel tactics for their attack operations.
 Aside from large terrorist groups, there are also lone-wolf and small-group attacks, using easily available weapons, which have become a more frequent modus operandi. These individuals do not need a well-defined structure for indoctrination, training, or command and control -- only an Internet connection to call them into action and turn them into a danger to others, said PM Lee.
 New forms of extremist ideologies are also emerging. In late 2020, Singapore dealt with its first far-right radicalisation case when a 16-year-old boy who was inspired by the 2019 Christchurch attacks planned to attack Muslims at two local mosques in Singapore. The boy was detained under the Internal Security Act.
 PM Lee said: "We take this danger seriously, because a single act of terror could tear apart the racial and religious harmony and trust that we have painstakingly built over the decades... This is where ISD comes in -- to make sure our people do not get captured by some extreme ideology, or caught up in quarrels which are not ours, to sow chaos within our own community."
 In addition to terrorism and domestic vulnerabilities, Singapore is also threatened by foreign actors who seek to subvert society, mount influence operations to manipulate Singaporeans or conduct espionage to compromise national secrets, he said.
 While these covert activities are not talked about much, there is no shortage of such threats in the world, and foreign influence and espionage remain a major security issue, added PM Lee. While the Singapore Armed Forces deals with physical attacks and wars, the ISD looks out for insidious threats that lurk in the shadows.
 He cited the 2017 incident involving a professor from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy who was expelled from Singapore for trying to influence senior decision-makers here. The China-born academic, Huang Jing, had worked with foreign intelligence groups and agents.
 PM Lee said ISD is the first line of defence when it comes to such influences and espionage operations, and must be as capable and shrewd as its adversaries when deciding how best to deal with these threats.
 He noted that ISD, which was established by the British colonial government as the Singapore Special Branch in 1948, has been transforming itself to ensure it remains capable today amid a constantly evolving environment.
 This includes having good facilities and offices that are conducive to ISD officers' work and training, and attractive career propositions that involve developing officers well and keeping them committed and motivated.
 PM Lee said it is not by chance that Singapore has succeeded in mitigating and neutralising security threats to domestic security and sovereignty since its independence. "ISD has been the steady force at our front lines. It has been neither shaken, nor stirred. Often staying away from the limelight, but ever present and ready to respond," he said.
 "We all sleep easier at night, knowing that ISD is there, keeping a watchful eye on things which can go bump in the night."

EU splits over approach to deal with Israel-Hamas conflict

Byline: Jonathan Eyal Global, EU splits over approach to deal with Israel-Hamas conflict
Body


LONDON  With the European Union divided over the course it should adopt in the Middle East, its heads of state and governments meeting in Brussels for their regular summit are devoting a substantial amount of time to coordinating their approach to the crisis. 
 The EU remains Israel's most prominent trade market, and the bloc's security is directly impacted by the confrontation between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.
 Tension is running high not only between the EU's 27 member states but also among EU's civil servants. 
 In an unprecedented step, over 850 EU officials accused Dr Ursula von der Leyen, the president of EU's executive body, the European Commission, of unilaterally taking Israel's side in the conflict, thereby contributing to what they termed as a "European cacophony", a loud mixture of diplomatic noise, with no coherent message.
 Although EU leaders are now pulling together, it is unlikely that the union will speak with one voice in the Gaza-Israel conflict.
 The EU suffers from two critical problems: long-running personal rivalries between politicians and an equally entrenched difference between member states over the approach to Israel and the Arab world.
 The bloc has two bodies: the European Council, which represents the heads of state and governments of the 27 members, and the European Commission, which runs all daily operations and employs around 32,000 civil servants.
 Theoretically, EU foreign policy is decided in the Council by presidents and prime ministers. Mr Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium, now leads that body.
 But the Commission pays, appoints and controls the EU's diplomats and embassies. 
 The union's foreign policy chief -- a position currently occupied by Mr Josep Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister -- sits within the Commission.
 The tussle between Mr Michel and Dr von der Leyen is so intractable that both attend, for instance, various multilateral bodies in which the EU is represented.
 Although awkward, the arrangement sometimes works well: in the case of Ukraine, for instance, the Council and Commission acted in unison.
 This is, however, not the case for the current Middle East crisis. 
 Days after the Oct 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Dr von der Leyen took it upon herself to fly to Israel to express support without consulting the Council or the EU foreign policy chief.
 On Oct 13, on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, Dr von der Leyen claimed she went there "to express solidarity with the Israeli people after the terrible terrorist attack by Hamas". She ignored the stance of the EU, which condemned the Hamas attack but appealed to Israel to respect international law in its military operations in Gaza.
 Dr von der Leyen attracted further controversy when, during a policy speech in Washington last week, she prioritised Israel's right to defend itself after Hamas' assault. But, she neglected to mention the core EU position that Israel must allow Palestinians to have their state.
 The backlash came quickly.
 Dispensing with diplomatic niceties, Mr Michel, the European Council president, bluntly reminded Dr von der Leyen that the Council, not her Commission, defines the EU's foreign policy.
 And Mr Borrell, the EU's top diplomat, even issued a rare public rebuke of his boss.
 The official position of the EU on any foreign policy is discussed by the foreign ministers of the 27 EU member states "in meetings chaired by me", he pointedly told journalists.
 But the EU's disarray goes much deeper.
 Germany -- Dr von der Leyen's home country -- and the central and eastern European member states tend to side with Israel. 
 In contrast, other European countries, such as Spain, Italy, France and Ireland, tend to be more critical of the Israelis.
 The result is that EU officials from these countries often mirror their nations' perspectives.
 Soon after Hamas struck Israel, for instance, Mr Oliver Varhelyi -- who comes from Hungary, a stalwart Israeli supporter and is the commissioner responsible for relations with the EU's immediate neighbours -- announced that the EU had suspended all aid to Palestinians.
 Hours later, Mr Varhelyi's announcement was overturned by the European Commission, which decided to double its aid to Palestine. 
 The two-day EU summit that ends on Friday can only examine deep policy and personnel differences. 
 But the backlash against Dr von der Leyen's unilateral initiatives in the Middle East has wider international ramifications, for it mirrors opposition to her equally ill-prepared initiatives on Europe's crucial relationship with China.
 Dr von der Leyen already raised eyebrows in March when she gave a particularly critical speech on China's trade practices in Europe, a move appreciated in Washington but much less so in Berlin, Paris or Rome.
 She annoyed EU member states even further in September when she announced the opening of an investigation into China's alleged subsidies of electric vehicles.
 Now, all of Europe's dirty diplomatic linen is being washed in public. 
 Mr Borrell used no other place but a press conference he held in Beijing last week to rebuke Dr von der Leyen for exceeding her powers in the Middle East.
 No doubt, his Chinese hosts took note of Europe's persistent failure to talk with one voice.

Indonesia Hospital in Gaza loses power as workers scramble for fuel

Byline: Hariz Baharudin, Indonesia Hospital in Gaza loses power as workers scramble for fuel
Body


JAKARTA  A hospital set up by Indonesians in the Gaza Strip has become one of the latest to run out of power, as aid workers scramble for fuel to continue saving lives amid the worsening humanitarian crisis there. 
 The Indonesia Hospital, which has been using generators for electricity amid an Israeli blockade on the enclave, was forced to treat the injured in darkness and shut down some of its services on Monday.
 Medical Emergency Rescue Committee (MER-C) Indonesia, a group that is on the ground at the hospital, said on Wednesday that a power cut had occurred. 
 "The power outage is due to a lack of fuel, which is difficult to get now," said the group in an Instagram post.
 The post contained video clips of what appears to be the hospital at night, with medical staff treating injured people using flashlights.
 The Gaza Strip has largely been cut off from fuel, electricity and clean water, after Israel declared a complete siege on the territory more than two weeks ago.
 Many in the international community have sounded the alarm against the move, given how such actions will affect the lives of civilians caught up in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas.
 The Gaza Strip has become the main target of the Israeli military's retaliatory air strikes after Hamas breached the border wall on Oct 7, killing more than 1,400 people and taking some 200 people hostage.
 The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has said that since Oct 7, over 7,000 people have been killed from Israeli attacks, including more than 2,900 children.
 The Indonesia Hospital, whose construction was funded by donations from Indonesians as well as organisations such as the Indonesian Red Cross Society and Islamic group Muhammadiyah, was inaugurated in 2016 by then Vice-President Jusuf Kalla and has 100 beds and four operating theatres. 
 Located in north Gaza, the hospital is one of many in the enclave that have been affected by the ongoing war. More than 20 other hospitals in north and central Gaza have been operating in similar conditions. 
 Hospitals in the area have been struggling to deal with the thousands of people who come daily to seek help with wounds they have received amid constant Israeli aerial bombardment.
 MER-C said that the Indonesia Hospital, outfitted with some solar panels, is able to turn on its power for about five hours in the day. At night, only part of the hospital can be lit up, and the rest of the building has to work in darkness.
 In a later update on Wednesday, MER-C volunteer Fikri Rohul Haq said the group's work goes on and that it had delivered 1,000 meals to staff and patients in the hospital, as well as medicine, snacks and clothes for paramedics.
 "We are still trying to find fuel for the use of electricity here in the Indonesia Hospital," he added.
 The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday that six hospitals in Gaza have been forced to close due to a lack of fuel.
 "Unless vital fuel and additional health supplies are urgently delivered into Gaza, thousands of vulnerable patients risk death or medical complications as critical services shut down due to lack of power," the WHO added.
 "For people in the Gaza Strip, the situation is desperate. It will become catastrophic without the safe and continuous passage of fuel and health supplies, and additional humanitarian assistance."

I speak for a group of concerned Singaporean women who are of both local and international standing.
 We are not an organised group, but individuals who feel we cannot just be bystanders as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens with a horrendous loss of innocent civilian lives, many of them children.
 We strongly support President Tharman Shanmugaratnam in his recent expression of concern for the safety and welfare of the helpless civilians caught in the Israel-Hamas conflict (Protection of civilians, more aid needed to prevent catastrophe in Gaza: President Tharman, Oct 22). 
 We appeal to those who have the power and influence to do all they can to implement the following: an immediate ceasefire; the urgent protection of civilian lives and civilian infrastructure; unimpeded access to humanitarian aid; immediate access to water, food and electricity for civilians in Gaza; and renewed effort to forge the two-state solution that is the only hope for lasting peace in the region.
 As President Tharman said in his remarks, the Israel-Palestine issues are complex but civilians, and especially children, should not have to pay the price when the politicians cannot or will not come to a just and lasting solution.

The ISD's vital role in keeping Singapore safe

Byline: , The ISD's vital role in keeping Singapore safe
Body


For three-quarters of a century, ISD has worked quietly and vigilantly in the background to keep Singapore safe and secure. Tonight's celebration is an opportunity for us to reflect on ISD's journey, and recognise the good work of many ISD officers over all these decades.
 Sometimes people think that nation-building is all sweetness and light. That all it takes is to have leaders to have great ideas, to inspire people to unite behind a common cause, and if we all work hard, we will progress and prosper. Of course, all of that is necessary, but it is not quite enough.
 Real life is more complicated. Societies have to defend themselves against all sorts of dangers. We would be gullible to think that everyone wishes us well. From abroad, we can be targeted by foreign influence operations and covert activities. On the domestic front, vulnerabilities and fault lines need to be managed. While we must not be paranoid and see shadows behind every corner, neither should we be naive about the real threats to an open and stable society. 
 It is therefore critical for the Government to stay well informed about such threats, and be equipped to deal with them.
 That is why the British colonial government established the Singapore Special Branch 75 years ago, after the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) launched an armed uprising to establish a communist state. During the Malayan Emergency, the Special Branch, as the domestic intelligence agency, played a central role in tackling the communist threat. After separation from Malaysia, the Special Branch was renamed the Internal Security Department in 1966. 
 Commenting on the battle against the CPM, Dr Goh Keng Swee said that "the first and most important of the prerequisites to success is, I regret to say, an efficient secret police, or 'Special Branch', to use the delicate British colonial term for it". He said this in the context of defeating a communist insurgency. But the need for an "efficient secret police", as Dr Goh called it, extends beyond this specific context. In the post-communist era, nations face a whole host of other dangers.
 Most countries have specialised intelligence agencies focused on their own domestic situations. The FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) in the US, the MI5 in Britain, the Shin Bet in Israel, or the Malaysian Special Branch, just to name a few. The ISD is our counterpart to these foreign agencies, equally and indeed even more essential to us because Singapore is more vulnerable than most other countries. As a diverse multiracial and multi-religious nation, our inherent fault lines will always exist. And being such an open and interconnected society, our people are susceptible to many external influences.
 During the Malayan Emergency, the communist threat to Singapore was inextricably linked to the insurgency being fought in Malaya -- the same Communist Party of Malaya operated on both sides of the Causeway. And looming large behind them were the communist giants, in particular China, which provided the CPM with support and ideological motivation.
 Today, we continue to be affected by trends in the region and beyond.
 We follow developments in the Middle East, including the ongoing social reforms in Saudi Arabia and the war between Israel and Hamas, to understand their impact on populations in South-east Asia, and on our own population.
 Our terrorism threat also does not arise domestically, but springs from the broader security situation in the region. The Jemaah Islamiyah group originated in Indonesia, and spawned cells in Malaysia and the Philippines as well as Singapore. ISIS operated in Syria and Iraq, but it inspired some Singaporeans to self-radicalise. 
 From Western countries, we are exposed to political and academic discourse that reflects their social problems and divisions. Ideas like white privilege and structural racism, and the rhetoric of intersectionality and social justice, and identity politics, can easily and uncritically find their way into our public debate, and lead us astray. 
 These are external influences that we should already be tracking. But because they can also be attack vectors exploited by parties who mean us harm, therefore all the more they demand our close attention.
 That is why it is vital to have a capable and vigilant ISD to protect ourselves.
 Tonight, let me talk about three security issues that preoccupy us -- the threat of terrorism, the dangers posed by foreign influence operations and our own domestic vulnerabilities.
 Terrorism The first major threat is terrorism. This has been high on ISD's priorities, especially the threat from Islamist terrorist groups. Around the time of the 9/11 attacks in 2001, we discovered the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group in Singapore. It had identified multiple targets and developed detailed plans to conduct a major attack here. 
 A decade plus later, ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, rose to prominence. Some Singaporeans were radicalised by their ideology, and a few even travelled to Syria to participate in armed jihad.
 It has been 22 years since 9/11. The threat from transnational Islamist terrorist groups has evolved but remains persistent. Dangerous groups continue to operate in our neighbourhood, including in Indonesia, the Philippines and other parts of South-east Asia. They have adopted new strategies for recruitment and fund-raising, and developed novel tactics for their attack operations. 
 Additionally, lone wolf and small group attacks, using easily available weapons, have become a more frequent modus operandi. Such misguided individuals do not need a well-defined structure for indoctrination, training, or command and control. All they need is an Internet connection to call them into action, and turn them into a danger to others.
 At the same time, new forms of extremist ideologies are emerging, such as far-right extremism. In late 2020, Singapore dealt with its first far-right radicalisation case -- a 16-year-old youth who was inspired by the Christchurch attacker, and planned to attack Muslims at two local mosques in Singapore.
 We take this danger seriously, because a single act of terror could tear apart the racial and religious harmony and trust that we have painstakingly built over the decades. We have seen this happen too often in other countries.
 This is where ISD comes in -- to make sure our people do not get captured by some extreme ideology, or caught up in quarrels which are not ours, to sow chaos within our own community.
 ISD's vigilance has repeatedly pre-empted and disrupted terrorist plots against us. ISD has also detected and dealt with many self-radicalised individuals, and prevented them from doing any harm.
 In fact, ISD not only countered these threats, but also managed to turn around most of those who were led astray. ISD's partnership with the Religious Rehabilitation Group and the Inter-Agency Aftercare Group has been crucial to the rehabilitation of many radicalised individuals.
 Since 2002, 137 Singaporeans have been issued with ISA (Internal Security Act) orders, nearly 90 per cent have made good progress in rehabilitation and have been successfully reintegrated into society.
 Foreign Influence and EspionageA second threat is foreign influence and espionage. This is not about war or physical attacks -- the SAF (Singapore Armed Forces) exists to deal with that. We are talking about more insidious threats that lurk in the shadows. ISD's job is to look out for them. ISD deals with foreign actors who seek to subvert us, mount influence operations to manipulate us, or conduct espionage to compromise our most precious secrets.
 We do not talk about these covert activities much, for good reasons, but there is no shortage of such threats in the world. We have to guard against the actions of countries that are at odds with us. Such things happen to Singapore too. ISD officers would be familiar with the 2017 case of the professor from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Espionage operations have also become increasingly sophisticated, moving into the cyber realm.
 By sharing these cases publicly, we hope to make Singaporeans understand better that the world is not as benign as it seems. 
 Our adversaries are well-resourced and determined. ISD is our first line of defence, and must be equally capable and shrewd when deciding how best to deal with these threats. 
 Do we intervene immediately to put a stop to it, and prevent further harm being done? Or do we sit tight, watch, and suss out the network, before making our move? And when we act, how do we manage the potential fallout on the broader bilateral relationship? 
 Making these choices requires patience, subtlety and good judgment. Ultimately the political leadership must make the calls, but they do so well-advised by ISD, with its depth of experience in the field. 
 Domestic VulnerabilitiesThe third major preoccupation is with our own domestic scene. Our society will always have inherent fault lines because of the diversity of races and religions in our population. Since independence, we have come a long way in building trust between different communities, but it would be unwise of us to imagine that differences in perspectives and attitudes have entirely disappeared.
 Just look at Singaporeans' reactions to recent developments. On the US-China tensions, Chinese Singaporeans, especially the older ones, tend to have different views compared to other Singaporeans. Every time conflict and violence flare up in the Middle East, passions get roused up in South-east Asia, and to some extent in Singapore too. 
 The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict is an especially emotive issue for Muslim Singaporeans, who empathise strongly with the plight of the Palestinian population, just like Muslim communities worldwide. And on the other side, certain segments of our Jewish and Christian communities get worked up too.
 All these differences are a reality we must recognise and accept. They remind us to continue watching racial and religious relations carefully because misunderstandings and frictions can still arise, and cause serious problems if not properly handled. 
 Besides race and religion, we also have to watch out for emerging social divisions. For example, simmering tensions between citizens and non-Singaporeans living and working here. And sharpening polarisation as various groups champion different causes, adopting strident advocacy and pressure group tactics learnt from elsewhere, dividing people for and against their cause.
 This is where ISD plays a crucial role behind the scenes, providing timely information and insightful assessments to the Government, beyond what is in the public domain or on social media.
 You are our eyes and ears on the ground, keeping in touch with all these various groups. You watch the trends vigilantly, and when problems threaten to grow serious, nip them in the bud before they can get out of hand. Your informed advice enables the Government to take action or adjust policies to address these concerns. In essence, you protect the public space for the proper and successful functioning of Singapore's democratic process.
 It is not by chance that Singapore has succeeded in mitigating and neutralising security threats to domestic security and sovereignty all this while. From its post-WWII roots till today, ISD has been the steady force at our front lines. It has been neither shaken, nor stirred. Often staying away from the limelight, but ever present and ready to respond. Driven by your mission of Keeping Singapore Safe and Sovereign for All Singaporeans. We all sleep easier at night, knowing that ISD is there, keeping a watchful eye on things which can go bump in the night.

Two-state solution back on agenda as US, Europe seek a way out of bloodshed

Body


LONDON  With Israeli troops expanding their land offensive against Hamas targets in Gaza, prospects for the Middle East look bleak. Just about the only certainty is that a United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a ceasefire has no chance of being implemented.
 Still, diplomats from the United States and Europe are working behind the scenes towards a more optimistic scenario, one in which political talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders could resume months after the current wave of violence subsides.
 "There are different ideas out there about what could follow (the fighting)," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told NBC News recently. "Israel cannot go back to the status quo."
 Although the history of the Middle East is full of aborted diplomatic initiatives, the "two-state solution" political framework, designed to allow the Palestinians to have their homeland, is back on the agenda after decades of neglect.
 Short of one community completely obliterating the other, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict can be addressed only in one or two ways: Create either a bi-national state for the Israelis and the Palestinians, or two separate states on the territory of old Palestine, which the British ruled until 1948.
 No Israeli leader was prepared to consider the first option, which would mean the end of Israel's character as a Jewish state. But quite a few Israeli politicians were ready to accept the second option: the emergence of an independent Palestine.
 An agreement on this point was reached in 1993 as part of the so-called Oslo Process, named after the capital of Norway, which mediated the deal.
 But differences over the borders of the future Palestinian state, the status of holy sites in Jerusalem and the right of some Palestinian refugees to return to their places of birth inside Israel prevented any progress.
 As time went by, subsequent Israeli governments -- and particularly the right-wing ones of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the country's longest-serving leader -- shelved the Palestinian problem.
 Mr Netanyahu weakened the Palestinian Authority (PA), which administers the West Bank, by encouraging around 500,000 Israelis to establish illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian land.
 He even gave tacit encouragement to Hamas, the radical Palestinian movement ruling Gaza -- the very same group responsible for the Oct 7 attack on Israel -- on the assumption that whatever keeps the Palestinians divided was good for Israel.
 When he was US president, Donald Trump went along with this Israeli policy of sabotaging a two-state solution by treating Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as a pariah.
 Trump also cut off American funds to the PA and recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
 Although President Joe Biden restored his country's financial aid to the PA as well as contribution to UNRWA, the UN mission responsible for Palestinian refugees and their descendants, Washington did little to address the bigger problem.
 On July 15, 2022, Mr Biden met PA President Abbas in the West Bank and expressed his dream of seeing "two states for two peoples, both having deep and ancient roots in this land, living side by side in peace and security".
 In practice, however, Washington restricted itself to a policy of distant crisis management.
 The Biden administration worked behind the scenes with Egypt and Jordan to promote a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas when a conflict broke out in 2021. But soon after that, the US just increased its military aid to Israel and tacitly concluded that a Palestinian state was no longer within reach.
 Mr Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden's national security adviser, exemplified Washington's complacency when he reassured a conference of experts late in September that "the Middle East region is calmer today than it has been in 20 years".
 A mere two weeks after Mr Sullivan spoke, the Middle East went up in flames.
 Both the Americans and their European allies now accept that addressing the plight of the Palestinians is critical to the restoration of Middle East stability.
 "It's important that we have on the horizon a peace summit where we can channel the engagement of the international community to reach a final agreement, a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine with the two-state solution," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, whose country holds the presidency of the European Union, said on Friday as an EU summit on the matter took place in Brussels.
 The Americans agree, although the US is struggling to remain on top of the diplomatic agenda, with its Congress in the doldrums and no appointed ambassador to Israel. Much of the current diplomacy is, therefore, handled remotely from Washington.
 Washington also has tense relations with two of the leading regional players and traditional mediators between Palestinian factions: Egypt and Turkey. 
 Still, it is only the US that can goad Israel back to the negotiating table with the Palestinians.
 And although Mr Biden remains very explicit in his public support for Israel, behind the scenes, he has also made it clear to Israeli politicians that America expects the resumption of a diplomatic process with the Palestinians.
 Mr Netanyahu, having spent his entire life scuppering any productive dialogue with the Palestinians, is hardly the interlocutor of the future.
 But even the Israeli leader now understands that if his country does not wish for Hamas to return to Gaza after the current fighting, it has no alternative but to encourage the PA to take over responsibilities for Gaza.
 Besides, the bets are that Mr Netanyahu's days in office are numbered. Most Israelis hold him responsible for the current crisis, and recent opinion polls indicate that his party would be lucky to get 12 per cent of the vote if elections were held now.
 The odds still are that the Israeli Premier will be out as early as the middle of 2024.
 And almost anyone who succeeds him as leader will know that a renewed dialogue with the Palestinians is inevitable.
 "The two-state is the only possible political solution for the historical dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. We need to separate from the Palestinians... they need to establish their independent Palestinian state," former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert said on Friday.
 The snag is that the PA enjoys little esteem with ordinary Palestinians, and 87-year-old Abbas is widely dismissed as ineffectual.
 But here again, Israel can help by releasing Marwan Barghouti, a top Palestinian leader who has languished in Israeli jails for the past two decades. Barghouti is both popular and resourceful; he could reinvigorate the Palestinian Authority.
 And although most Israelis regard him as a terrorist, he would be preferable for Israel's leaders to the alternative, which is Hamas.
 Much will depend on how the current fighting develops. A localised war would make dialogue easier; a broader conflict -- perhaps involving Iran -- would bring more significant complications.
 There is also the snag of the looming US election, making it difficult for the Biden administration to concentrate on the Middle East. 
 Still, the fact remains that politicians in both the US and Europe hope to find a way ahead from the current bloodshed.

Israel-Hamas war widens fissures in Jewish communities worldwide

WASHINGTON/SYDNEY Many Jewish people in the United States are deeply worried about rising anti-Semitism, supercharged by the war between Israel and Hamas that has inflamed passions on all sides to an intensity not seen in recent memory.
 But there is division within the Jewish community too.
 Across the world, the war that began with a bloody incursion by Hamas militants inside Israel that left 1,400 Israelis dead has affected Jewish, Palestinian and wider Arab communities in varying ways. 
 In Germany, the authorities are cracking down on pro-Palestinian demonstrations, which are banned. 
 But some in the country's political left have questioned this, arguing that the bans silence legitimate concerns about Israel's relentless retaliatory bombardment of the Gaza Strip. 
 Guilt over its own history, however, drives Germany's official position. 
 Visiting Israel on Oct 17, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said: "History and our responsibility arising from the Holocaust make it our duty to stand up for the existence and security of Israel".
 In an article posted on Oct 19, the European Council on Foreign Relations warned about the dangers of the situation in France. 
 "With its large Jewish and Muslim communities, and a fraught colonial past in the Middle East and North Africa, France is being torn apart by the events in Gaza and Israel," it said. 
 "While the war in Ukraine generated a rare consensus within the French population and political class, the war in Gaza may expose the strong divides that underpin it."
 France is home to around six million Muslims, mostly of North African descent, who have long been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. 
 "The ongoing destruction caused by the Israeli siege of Gaza has triggered personal and deep-seated anger within France's Muslim community," the article warned. 
 "The French authorities fear another outburst of violence may be imminent," it said. "In particular, there are grave concerns that France's Jewish community, which is the largest in Europe, may be targeted. Over a hundred anti-Semitic acts were reported in the five days following the Hamas attack."
 The Jewish population in France is estimated to be over 500,000.
 Across the Atlantic, anger is erupting in the United States, home to an estimated 7.5 million Jews.
 Last Wednesday, at the liberal Cooper Union College in New York City, a group of Jewish students locked themselves inside the library as protesters outside chanted "Free Palestine" and pounded on the doors. 
 The previous night in Washington, on the outer wall of a library building at George Washington University, a projector beamed phrases including "Glory to our martyrs". 
 There are calls to expel the students involved in the projection. 
 The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a New York-based Jewish non-governmental organisation that tracks anti-Semitism, said last Tuesday that reported incidents of harassment, vandalism and assault against Jewish people in the US had increased by 388 per cent over the same period in 2022. 
 This was since the Hamas attack on Oct 7 initiated the current wave of violence and reprisals, which has seen more than 7,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, according to figures released by the Health Ministry there.
 The ADL said it recorded a total of 312 incidents between Oct 7 and last Monday, of which 190 were directly linked to the war in Israel and Gaza. 
 In Australia -- another immigrant society where the relatively small Jewish community includes refugees from the Holocaust and their descendants -- Hamas' rampage also revived memories of brutalities past.
 There are around 100,000 Jews in Australia. 
 In the days after the attack, a pro-Palestinian rally at the Opera House in Sydney featured anti-Semitic chants such as "gas the Jews" and "death to the Jews".
 Jews were advised by the authorities to stay away from the rally for their safety -- a move that was widely criticised, triggering an apology to the Jewish community from New South Wales Premier Chris Minns.
 As in the US, Jewish and Muslim groups in Australia have reported an increase in anti-Semitic and Islamophobic attacks. 
 Security has been stepped up at Jewish schools and synagogues, and at mosques, with the help of an extra A$10 million (S$8.7 million) from the federal government. 
 Mr Peter Wertheim, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, which represents the Australian Jewish community, acknowledged that the state and federal authorities had "gone to great lengths to stand with the Jewish community at this anxious time".
 "The carnage in Israel and the disgraceful displays of anti-Semitism... evoke powerful historical memories in the Jewish community, especially among our Holocaust survivors and descendants (of whom we have the highest percentage of any Jewish community outside Israel)," he told The Sunday Times.
 While there are scattered voices of dissent from Jews who have condemned Israel's attacks on Gaza, the response from representative bodies and the strong attendance at public rallies suggest the community in Australia is largely unified in backing Israel.
 The Jewish community has held emotive rallies in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, attended by thousands, to express solidarity with Israel.
 "Though we may be far away, our hearts and our prayers are with the people of Israel," Mr David Ossip, president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, said at the Sydney rally on Oct 11. 
 "We gather here, the Jewish people, to strengthen one another, to fortify one another," he said.
 Some Australians have been directly affected by the Hamas attacks, including hundreds evacuated on repatriation flights arranged by the federal government. 
 One of those murdered by Hamas was Ms Galit Carbone, a 66-year-old Sydney-born grandmother who was killed near her home at a kibbutz in Israel.
 Australia's Jewish community has also launched fund-raising schemes to support Israel and provide medical equipment and aid to survivors of the Hamas attack and victims' families.
 The Jerusalem Post last week reported that Jewish people globally had raised hundreds of millions of dollars for Israel. 
 Of these funds, at least US$70 million (S$96 million) was raised by the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York. 
 Dissent in the US has been more open -- but middle ground is hard to find.  
 The war has brought long-running fissures in American, and Jewish American, society to the fore.  
 "What was so striking was to see how fast we were turning on each other -- how we became obsessed not with what should actually be done, or even what was actually being done, but with what was and could be said, and by whom," said Jewish American podcaster Ezra Klein.  
 Jewish American professor of American studies Glenn Altschuler at Cornell University told ST: "The fissures divide, in some instances, Jews and non-Jews who are staunchly pro-Israel, from Jews and non-Jews, including those on the progressive left, some African Americans and others, who have strong feelings about Palestinian rights and a Palestinian state.
 "It has brought to the surface fissures between progressive and conservative Jews, younger and older Jews, and between Jews for whom a pro-Israel position is a political litmus test -- and those who do not believe that is a litmus test."
 That has left many trying to find a way to give voice to horror at the Hamas attack that targeted innocent civilians, but to also place that event in the context of the long struggle for Palestinian rights.
 "For many, this is an either/or situation. And if you're not an either/or kind of guy, you are going to be subjected to serious criticism," Prof Altschuler said.  
 Students and faculty at elite colleges and universities have traditionally been sympathetic to Palestinian rights. 
 But since the war began, donors have pulled funding from universities, and job offers to students have been withdrawn over their political positions. 
 Those caught in this balancing act are flanked by two sides demonising each other. 
 "This has meant that some people do not speak out at all... over fears for their own safety," Prof Altschuler said. 
 That fear is evident well beyond America.
 ST reached out to Jewish organisations in Germany, for instance, and received no response. 
 But in New York City on Friday, as Israel stepped up its ground operations in Gaza, more than a thousand Jewish people -- and others -- marched into Grand Central Station demanding an immediate ceasefire. 
 As they sat down, temporarily blocking the terminal, about 200 were arrested.  
 Last Wednesday in Washington, a Jewish group called IfNotNow, which advocates an end to US support for Israel and demands "equality, justice, and a thriving future for all Palestinians and Israelis", held a ceremony for the dead in the war -- Israelis and Palestinians alike. 
 The group unfurled banners calling for a ceasefire. Jewish hymns for the dead were sung, and names of scores of known victims -- representing only a part of the death toll -- were read aloud. 
 Under a blue autumn sky, with the US Capitol behind them, the demonstrators took turns to read the names. Some, when reading the names of dead children, wept.

Singapore supports efforts to send aid to Gaza, says envoy to UN

Body


Singapore has expressed its support for the efforts of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to sustain the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and calls for all innocent civilian lives to be protected, said Singapore's Ambassador to the UN Burhan Gafoor.
 "At the outset, I wish to express Singapore's utmost support for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to sustain the flow of humanitarian assistance to the civilians affected by this terrible tragedy in Gaza," said Mr Gafoor.
 "We commend the Secretary-General for his leadership role in facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance and recognise the important contributions made by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations on the ground," he noted.
 He added that Singapore supports all efforts to defuse tensions in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict.
 "Respect for the UN Charter and for international law has always been a fundamental guiding principle of Singapore's foreign policy. The UN Charter and international law provide the foundation for international peace and security," Mr Gafoor said.
 The ambassador made these comments at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, as Singapore voted in support of a resolution drafted by Arab states calling for an immediate humanitarian truce.
 The non-binding resolution received 121 votes in favour, while 44 abstained and 14 -- including Israel and the United States -- voted "no". 
 Israel has heavily bombarded Gaza since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel's retaliatory action has killed more than 7,000 people in Gaza, according to the enclave's Health Ministry. 
 Mr Gafoor said: "We mourn the loss and suffering of so many innocent civilians, including children and the elderly. This attack (by Hamas) cannot be condoned or justified by any rationale. We condemn this terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms. We also call for the immediate and safe release of all hostages taken by Hamas.
 "In this regard, it is worth recalling that just in June this year, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy," he noted. 
 This, he said, calls for the international community to reiterate its "strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes".
 Israel has the legitimate right to defend its citizens and its territory under international law, said Mr Gafoor.
 However, he also pointed out that Israel also has an obligation to comply with international humanitarian law. 
 "All parties must abide by international humanitarian law and do their utmost to protect the safety and security of civilians," said the ambassador.
 He added that Singapore welcomes all efforts to establish and uphold safe zones and routes that will keep civilians out of harm's way and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. 
 "Singapore is deeply saddened by the dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the loss of so many civilian lives. This is a massive humanitarian crisis," said Mr Gafoor.
 "We urge all parties involved to allow the rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip," he added. 
 To support humanitarian relief operations in Gaza, the Government has made a financial contribution through the Singapore Red Cross, said Mr Gafoor. 
 Many Singaporeans have also made their own contributions to relief operations, he said, noting that it is the Republic's hope that their contributions will reach those in need quickly. 
 On the resolution, Mr Gafoor said that Singapore has voted in favour after very careful consideration, but added that the Republic deeply regrets that this resolution has "two glaring and significant omissions". 
 "First, it makes no mention of Hamas' role in perpetrating the massive and coordinated terror attacks, which led to the brutal killing of 1,400 Israelis and others and the abduction of more than 200 hostages," he said.
 "These are acts of terror that we condemn unequivocally, and the abhorrent deeds of Hamas cannot be justified by any rationale whatsoever," said the ambassador, as he reiterated Singapore's call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all civilians taken hostage. 
 "Second, this resolution does not acknowledge Israel's legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory in compliance with international law. As with every country, Israel has a right to defend itself from heinous terrorist attacks, to protect its people from senseless violence and to keep its territory secure," he added.
 Nevertheless, Singapore supported the resolution as the Republic has "always been a consistent advocate and defender of international law, the UN Charter and the rules-based multilateral system", said Mr Gafoor.  
 He pointed out that the resolution reaffirms all parties' obligations to respect and uphold international law, including international humanitarian law. 
 "These obligations have been spelt out in many UN Security Council resolutions. All innocent civilian lives must be protected," he stressed.
 On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr Gafoor said that it is a "longstanding one, and it must be resolved in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions". He called it the only way to stop the repeated cycles of violence. 
 "Singapore's position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been consistent. We continue to hold the view that the only viable path to a durable, just and comprehensive solution is a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions," he said. 
 Mr Gafoor also stressed that Singapore calls on leaders from both sides to show leadership, to exercise restraint and to take the difficult but necessary steps towards the vision of a two-state solution.
 "We support the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland, and Israel's right to live within secure borders. Both Palestinians and Israelis deserve to live in peace, security and dignity," he added.

Conversations with Israeli and Palestinian friends in a time of war

Body


A week after Hamas' Oct 7 attack on Israel, I rang a friend in Tel Aviv. 
 E was a classmate from graduate school in Massachusetts. In the 13 years since, we would meet regularly, in Europe and in Asia. 
 When I called, she and her husband were in a car on the way to see their four-year-old son. Since Oct 7, he has been living separately from them, having been dispatched to her parents' house, which has a bunker -- a safer option as Hamas rockets are still landing on parts of Israel. 
 "What do you want to know'" she asked rhetorically during the conversation. Nothing, I replied. We had texted and I knew she was unharmed. But I just wanted to hear her voice and see her face. 
 E began weeping silently. I was the first friend from outside of Israel to call, and seeing me on her phone screen reminded her of a world before Oct 7, a world in which she had felt safe. 
 That world is now gone. Whatever sense of security Israelis felt in their 75-year-old home -- with bulwarks built from an Iron Dome missile defence system, a 64km concrete and steel barrier along the border with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, formidable military and intelligence services -- has evaporated. 
 Some 1,400 civilians died, while more than 200 were taken hostage in an act of terror by Hamas militants charging through southern Israel on Oct 7. 
 The resultant shock and terror now has E and her countryfolk in an iron vice. 
 That same week, I called another friend. Nizar is a Palestinian living in the United States, where he teaches leadership and international affairs at George Washington University. 
 His face was etched with grief. In response to Oct 7, Israel had been bombing Gaza, and more was to come; the day before our chat, Israel's military called for civilians in the northern half of Gaza to relocate south in preparation for a ground invasion to root out Hamas operatives and annihilate the group. 
 A blockade, meanwhile, meant that there was no food, fresh water or fuel entering the densely populated enclave, for its 2.2 million people -- half of them children. 
 When we spoke, 1,800 Palestinians had been killed. In the days since, the toll has risen to at least 7,700 as at Saturday. 
 This is bound to further increase exponentially as Israel's ground operation grinds into action, with Hamas vowing to respond with "full force". 
 Nizar wondered aloud about the "double standards" that he feels are at play in the world's reaction to the conflict. 
 Where was the outrage in 1948 when 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from what is today Israel, and Israel's subsequent occupation of Palestinian territories and its relentless expansion of illegal settlements, he asked. 
 "These double standards are so hurting. It is as if we don't matter." 
 But, he added: "Please contact our Israeli friends. Make them feel heard. A big source of the 'stuck' is that Israelis feel the world hasn't got their back." 
 Two groups, both in painTwo different groups of people are in immense pain. 
 And for the rest of us -- watching, reading and consuming the information (and disinformation) coming out of the region -- we too have had to grapple with strong emotions and difficult questions. 
 There is abhorrence at what happened on Oct 7. There can be no justification for what the Hamas militants did in gunning down, slaughtering and abducting innocent civilians, including young children and the elderly -- no matter how much their supporters accuse Israel of being directly culpable as a result of its past and present actions. 
 There is also intense grief at what has happened since Oct 7. It has been three weeks of relentless bombing in Gaza, about half the size of Singapore. A church is gone. A street of dwellings flattened. An entire city wiped off the face of the earth. What remains: a woman cradling a child-sized shroud. 
 Most of us can and do hold both emotions within. It should be clear -- and if it is not, we need to repeat it over and over again -- that anguish over what is now happening in Gaza does not detract from the heartbreak for those suffering in Israel, and vice versa. 
 It also should be clear that we can and do hold a few different thoughts simultaneously: that Hamas' actions are driven by cold-blooded calculations and that it has no qualms about killing Israeli civilians and sacrificing Gazans to achieve its aims of inflaming the region; and that Israel's hot rage is propelling it towards the catastrophic unleashing of collective punishment on an entire population as it hunts down Hamas. 
 Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam wrote in a social media post last Sunday: "Anyone with a conscience must be deeply troubled by the unfolding human tragedy in Gaza. Anyone with a conscience must also be repulsed by the killings by Hamas militants in southern Israel." 
 He traced some of the history that brought both sides to this point: The Hamas assault evokes painful memories of the repeated pogroms against Jews through history. 
 There is also the trauma and desperation of the Palestinians living under a 16-year Israeli siege of Gaza in dehumanising conditions, while armed Israeli settlers in the West Bank continue the dispossession of Palestinians from their homes. 
 "But one thing is clear," Mr Tharman stressed. 
 "Nothing in their complex history, or the grief experienced by either, can justify the indiscriminate taking of civilian lives on either side. It offends basic human morality, and flouts international law." 
 That boat has long sailed for Hamas. This past week, voices calling for Israel to exercise restraint in its retaliatory military actions have grown ever louder. 
 On Thursday, a deadly strike landed on a refugee camp in the south of Gaza -- which Israel's military has repeatedly urged Palestinians to evacuate to. Meanwhile, with the lack of essential supplies coming through, including via the Rafah crossing from Egypt, families are also facing death by dehydration and disease. 
 The United Nations General Assembly on Friday overwhelmingly voted for an immediate humanitarian truce and demanded aid access to Gaza and protection of civilians. Singapore was among the 121 members that cast a "yes" vote. 
 While the US voted "no", President Joe Biden has implored Israel to abide by the rules of war and to "do everything in its power" to protect civilians from harm. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres went further, accusing the country of "clear violations of international humanitarian law" and adding that the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. 
 This triggered a furious response from Israel. Foreign Minister Eli Cohen wrote that "after the Oct 7 massacre, there is no place for a balanced approach. Hamas must be erased off the face of the planet!". 
 In trying to parse the proportionality of Israel's counter-actions under the Geneva Conventions, observers have also found themselves up against the lack of an exact formula of what that could mean. In general, the proportionality principle in a war operation involves balancing between the anticipated military advantage accrued and the loss of civilian life and injury to civilians. 
 Israel's argument is that Hamas is using civilians as human shields, hiding weapons and command centres in schools, mosques and other civilian infrastructure, and that an obliteration of the group therefore involves -- justifiably -- hitting such targets. 
 Ms Nave Dromi, director of think-tank Middle East Forum's office in Israel, wrote on its website: "Hamas cannot be allowed to stand after this war. They must never be allowed to raise their heads again to massacre Israelis. This must be the last war against Hamas. Clearly, defeating Hamas is the only proportional response possible." 
 In this fog of competing imperatives and narratives, the calls to look beyond the shorter-term objectives are a ray of clarity. 
 It is of utmost importance to protect innocent civilians and avoid collective punishment of a whole population, said Mr Tharman. 
 "Not only because there are compelling humanitarian reasons. Not only because international law requires so. 
 "But because each round of extremism and violence against innocent people will harden hearts, and create new enemies. It risks broadening the conflict in the region. And it makes it more difficult to find a path to a future of peace, a future of hope for the young." 
 No one, it seems, is in a state yet to think about an enduring solution to the Palestinian question and a longstanding civilisational conflict -- and yet that is what's needed to eventually protect both Israelis and Palestinians from endless cycles of violence. 
 Work, war and tearsI text my friends now and then, checking on them. 
 E, who runs a start-up, is a whirl of action, busy with "work and war". Israelis, previously politically divided, are galvanised like never before, she said. 
 "I think all the country is mobilised. From preparing sandwiches for soldiers, through organised donations of equipment, running donation centres, people and hotels are opening rooms for refugees from the south and for those who are being evacuated from the north, media campaigns, tech support from cyber companies... you name it. The civil society is completely mobilised. 
 "This is the only thing that keeps people strong -- and that's why we are going to overcome this." 
 We spoke of the innocent Palestinians who have died. She said: "They, like us, are pawns in this larger game." She added: "Hamas has to go. The stakes for Israel are existential." 
 Nizar is keeping himself occupied too. He grades his students' papers at his university, and does media interviews on the situation. I asked him how he keeps an even emotional keel in the face of heart-rending losses among his people. He said: "I cry with my friends." 
 With the current polarisation of political debate around the world, with individuals, universities, media outlets, countries being sorted into "with us or against us" camps, there is pressure to pick sides and to slip into one mode or the other today: to be pro-Israel/ anti-Palestine or pro-Palestine/ anti-Israel. Yet, there are no easy answers; this is a conflict with a long history and blood on all parties' hands barring the civilians. 
 In my conversations with my friends on opposite sides of this horrific war, I strive to hold space for their emotions -- those same notes of grief and rage but in different keys. In so doing, I also find in myself a greater ability -- and indeed a need -- to acknowledge their truths and to stand on both sides.

Malaysian celebrities, businesses, schools show support for Palestinians

KUALA LUMPUR  Celebrities, businesses and even schools in Malaysia are rallying support for the Palestinian cause as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth week, reflecting the deep sympathies of the Muslim-majority country for the Middle Eastern community.
 Roused by several peaceful protests and a solidarity concert last Tuesday headlined by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim himself, various initiatives to highlight the plight of displaced Palestinians in Gaza and raise funds for them have sprung up.
 Last Thursday, the Education Ministry declared a Solidarity with Palestine programme for schools, colleges and teacher training institutes that runs from Sunday to Friday.
 While the stated aim of these events is to "instil humanitarian values... and create a sense of empathy for those who are suffering" regardless of creed or colour, the move has stirred some controversy.
 Two government MPs, Datuk Willie Mongin and Datuk Ngeh Koo Ham, as well as more than a dozen non-governmental organisations have raised concerns about involving schoolchildren in the conflict.
 "For me personally, it should not be brought to school, where students probably do not understand the issues. I am concerned that parties might try to instil hatred among our youth. We should be teaching them to have love for one another," said Mr Ngeh.
 These concerns were heightened last Friday, when videos and pictures of an unknown primary school for children with special needs, showing its teachers and pupils brandishing toy firearms while carrying Palestine flags and wearing Palestinian keffiyeh scarves, went viral. 
 Datuk Seri Anwar told reporters that the government will closely monitor the ministry's programme and ensure it "doesn't get out of control". The Education Ministry has ordered a thorough investigation into the videos. 
 Israel launched a total siege of Gaza after an Oct 7 cross-border attack on southern Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas killed 1,400 Israelis, including numerous civilians.
 At least 7,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed during weeks of bombardment by Israeli forces.
 Meanwhile, Malaysians are going online to show support for the Palestinians, including top local singer Siti Nurhaliza, who has nine million followers on Instagram.
 It was reported on Oct 18 that her postings have been blocked by the platform, but the singer has continued uploading pro-Palestinian messages on her account, including a post for the Special Palestinian Fund that has received almost 18,000 likes.
 Actress and businesswoman Neelofa, who has a following of 8.7 million people on Instagram, has also posted messages of support for Palestine, saying that despite an ongoing conflict now at around 60 years, Israel has not defeated the Palestinians due to Allah's protection. The post has received more than 217,000 likes.
 Local businesses are also donating a portion of their sales proceeds to the cause, including Ashanim Dress Lab, which pledged to donate 10 per cent of the sales from its Palestine headscarf line to the Palestine Humanitarian Fund.
 Deputy Finance Minister Steven Sim has asked Malaysians to purchase Palestinian products as a sign of support.
 "I cannot afford to fight in Gaza, but every year I buy Palestinian products such as olive oil and dates. We Malaysians need to support by buying Palestinian products," he was quoted as saying by local daily Berita Harian.
 Humanitarian group Viva Palestina chairman Musa Mohd Nordin told The Straits Times that Malaysian support mainly comes from its Malay Muslim community. The Malays make up about 60 per cent of the country's 32-million strong population. 
 "The support for Palestine is seen as not only a humanitarian issue, but more importantly, a religious obligation. Palestine is home to Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the third-holiest mosque for Muslims," said Dr Musa.
 Malaysia recognised the Palestine Liberation Organisation and allowed it to open an office in Kuala Lumpur in 1974.
 Under Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad's administration, it was given full diplomatic recognition in August 1982.
 The country has been firm in supporting a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, even though it has no diplomatic ties with Israel.
 It has also refused to label Hamas a terrorist organisation and has hosted Hamas leaders such as its politburo founding member Khaled Meshaal in 2019.
 In 2011, the Palestinian Cultural Organisation Malaysia was founded in Kuala Lumpur to promote the concerns and issues of occupied Palestine, and to strengthen mutual understanding and cooperation with Malaysian society. 
 This non-governmental organisation, however, has been described by some as an "unofficial embassy of Hamas in Malaysia".
 Friends of Palestine Network Malaysia representative Heba Abdalrahim told ST she was grateful for Malaysia's consistent support of the Palestinian cause.
 Miss Heba, a Palestinian, and her family have been in Malaysia for almost a decade. There are 2,500 Palestinian refugees residing in the country, with 30 per cent of them being students.
 "Mr Anwar, like his predecessors, has played a significant role in supporting the rights of the Palestinian people. 
 "This support was particularly evident during the current war, where Mr Anwar swiftly facilitated humanitarian aid to Gaza, underscoring his commitment to humanitarian values," she said.

Israel goes for surprising strategy in pursuit of land offensive goals

Byline: Jonathan Eyal Global, Israel goes for surprising strategy in pursuit of land offensive goals
Body


LONDON  Israel's ground offensive against Hamas started with minor land incursions into Gaza that are currently being slowly expanded, rather than the full-frontal invasion with heavy tanks and armoured personnel carriers that everyone expected.
 This surprising strategy makes perfect sense for the Israelis, however, representing a balance between military and political objectives. And it reduces the anticipated risks to the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).
 But it also indicates that the war will last for months rather than weeks -- and that much of the fighting will still be both bloody and gruelling.
 Israel is pursuing two objectives in the current military operation.
 The first is to destroy Hamas, the radical Palestinian armed organisation responsible for killing more than 1,400 Israelis in a single day's attack on Oct 7.
 But the second objective is just as important: To be seen to have destroyed Hamas in such a convincing manner that even if the organisation claims to have emerged unscathed from this war -- as it unquestionably will -- nobody would believe it.
 To achieve these, no amount of aerial bombardment of Hamas' installations in Gaza can be regarded as sufficient, unlike previous operations against the organisation.
 Instead, IDF troops must physically be seen to have dismantled Hamas' tunnels, command posts and other facilities in Gaza in a systematic and irreversible way.
 Experts and retired generals around the world were quick to offer Israel unsolicited advice about how dangerous its ground operations were likely to be.
 "If they (Hamas) are as creative in the defence as they were in that horrific, barbaric, unspeakable attack, then you will see suicide bombers, you will see improvised explosive devices, there will be ambushes, booby traps, and the urban setting, again, could not be more challenging," warned retired US general David Petraeus, one of America's most decorated commanders.
 In fact, the Israelis did not need foreign advice to know that land offensives in built-up areas are highly dangerous; it is why successive Israeli governments have refrained from ordering their troops into Gaza. 
 So, although a land invasion is now deemed a necessity, Israel is adopting a strategy designed to diminish the risks.
 First, the Israeli target is limited to just the northern part of the Strip and to Gaza City, where Hamas had its key operational commands. It is likely that many Hamas fighters have already fled to southern Gaza, blending in with hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees. 
 Still, if Israel succeeds in demolishing the Hamas infrastructure in the north, the organisation will need years to recover, assuming there is anything usable left amid the rubble of Gaza City.
 The fighting will be very tough.
 An unknown number of fighters from Hamas and affiliated groups are in the northern Gaza Strip, from some 40,000 fighters expected to be mustered overall.
 Hamas' huge warren of underground tunnels, as well as its storerooms and underground command posts -- a network estimated to total around 500km -- will not only be tricky to identify and dangerous to clear, but also difficult to destroy.
 The Israelis will have to transport large amounts of explosives and spread these along a significant portion of the tunnels' lengths to ensure that there will be little of Hamas' underground infrastructure left for it to quickly reuse after Israeli troops depart.
 And while engaging in all these operations, IDF troops will have to watch out not only for ambushes but also for the structural collapse of buildings whose foundations are fused into the tunnels built by Hamas.
 The current pattern of Israeli deployments suggests that the tanks that have crossed the border over the weekend are aiming to establish several bases inside Gaza, from which smaller and more mobile IDF units will fan out to hit Hamas targets.
 Combined land and sea operations are now unfolding fast, with the Israeli Navy's Shayetet 13 crack unit -- similar to the US Navy Seals -- now very much to the fore, together with other commando units.
 Hamas' only way to survive at this point is to bog Israel down with hit-and-run attacks and ambushes inside Gaza.
 But the IDF's current strategy is not to take the bait of being permanently present in dangerous built-up areas.
 In effect, the Israelis are hoping to use guerilla warfare techniques against Hamas: rapid, precise attacks, followed by withdrawal to well-protected new Israeli bases on Gaza's territory.
 A "modular" approach is emerging, almost certainly implying that Israel will not ever occupy all of Gaza.
 That will not only satisfy the United States, which has put pressure on Israel to seek achievable objectives, but will also allow the Israeli government to continue negotiating the potential release of its hostages held by Hamas.
 And while the operation can be scaled down, it can also be scaled up: At least 250,000 IDF troops are massed on Gaza's border.
 The only danger for Israeli military planners is that global outrage at the rising number of civilian casualties may force the government to agree to a ceasefire well before its objectives are achieved.
 For now, however, the Israelis are confident that they can withstand international pressure as long as they have US support.
 As will become apparent later on Monday, when the United Nations Security Council debates the Gaza war.

S'pore shows clear stand on Israel-Hamas conflict in vote supporting UN resolution: Shanmugam

Body


 Singapore took a clear stand and expressed its concerns on the grave situation in Gaza by supporting a United Nations resolution calling for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce, said Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam on Sunday.
 The Republic on Friday cast a "very major vote" in support of a non-binding resolution drafted by the Arab states, which received 121 votes in favour, 14 against and 44 abstentions.
 Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Mr Shanmugam noted that the resolution -- titled "Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations" -- had called for a truce leading to a cessation of hostilities.
 It also called for an immediate and unhindered provision of essential supplies to civilians in Gaza, for Israel to rescind its evacuation orders in the Gaza Strip, and rejected the forced transfer of Palestinians.
 The resolution also reaffirmed that the solution to the conflict should be through a peaceful two-state solution, Mr Shanmugam said at an event organised by non-profit organisation Humanity Matters to pack medical and relief supplies for people in Gaza.
 Singapore's position on the conflict was made clear by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong some days ago, and the UN resolution is consistent with the position that the Republic has taken over 50 years, Mr Shanmugam said.
 He added: "But, while we voted in support of the resolution, we did not think it comprehensively set out the whole picture." 
 There are two areas the resolution should have mentioned, he said.
 "We must still condemn the terrorist attacks by Hamas on 7 October, which cannot be justified, and we need to note also Israel's right to self-defence, but that right to self-defence cannot include indiscriminate killing of civilians, and it must be done in accordance with international law." 
 When asked about some posts by the Israeli Embassy that could be advocating for a cause, Mr Shanmugam said Singapore does not take any foreign interference in its domestic politics lightly. 
 "Our position is quite clear. We expect any ambassador or embassy to respect the way things are done in Singapore," he added.
 "So, we do track closely what foreign missions say and do here, and whenever necessary, we will speak firmly to them, to make our position clear. We have done so before, and if need be, we will do so again."
 Turning to why the authorities have disallowed public rallies at Hong Lim Park relating to the Israel-Hamas conflict on public order reasons, Mr Shanmugam said that if Singapore allows one group to hold rallies, it must allow other groups to do so as well. 
 For example, religious groups like Muslim and Christian organisations have wanted to hold rallies, he said. 
 "We took the decision that we will not allow rallies by anyone. We don't want to import foreign arguments into Singapore."
 On online advocacy, he said people are entitled to express their views as long as online posts do not ask people to take up arms, do bad things, or incite violence or hate speech against other religions and races.
 On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam held a closed-door meeting with more than 200 Malay/Muslim community leaders to explain the Government's position on the matter. 
 He noted there has been a lot of misinformation and disinformation about the situation and the Government's position. 
 On a two-state solution, he said: "We have voted against illegal settlements by Israel -- we said it was contradictory to the international law. We have voted against Jerusalem being the capital of Israel." 
 At the same time, Singapore has always supported Israel's right to exist, whereas Hamas wants to wipe Israel off the map, Mr Shanmugam said.
 He said the Government will try to explain the situation and stance to the Singapore community as a whole. 
 Acknowledging the strong need and desire in the community to do something about the situation, he said efforts such as the one on Sunday to send supplies to people in Gaza are constructive ways to help. Another way is to make Singapore's position known internationally, like the way the country voted at the UN, he added.
 Humanity Matters brought together 100 volunteers from different faith organisations to pack medical and relief supplies worth $215,000. The event on Sunday took more than four hours. Four volunteers will make their way to Rafah city in the southern Gaza strip this week to deliver eight tonnes of supplies to displaced civilians of the conflict.
 On Saturday, residents in Nee Soon GRC launched a month-long campaign to collect supplies and donations to help people in Gaza. The campaign has collected just under $30,000 so far. 
 Taoist Mission secretary-general Tay Hung Yong was one of the volunteers on Sunday packing supplies such as IV fluid bags, painkillers and collapsible jerrycans for water storage.
 He said: "Many people there are suffering, and not many of us can be there in person, so we are contributing in every little way we can.
 "Through these initiatives, we hope to enhance inter-faith understanding. We are all one people, regardless of faith, and we should show that through our actions."
 SimplyIslam.sg human resource head Sairah Elley said: "It is quite ingrained in Singaporeans to help those in need, regardless of race, language or religion. It's a humanitarian crisis. I think what is happening is really sad, and we need to let Palestinians know that they have people on the outside who are trying to help, and that they are not alone.
 "It's quite (an) emotional (experience) actually, and I've been very overwhelmed the entire morning working alongside everyone."

Singapore and Malaysia both voted in support of the United Nations resolution that called for humanitarian assistance and a humanitarian truce for the Israel-Hamas conflict. 
 This is despite the two countries' differences in their relations with Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
 Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said such differences in their diplomatic situations will not affect their bilateral relations. 
 He was speaking at a joint press conference for the Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat at the Istana on Monday.   
 His Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim noted a recent UN resolution calling for humanitarian assistance and a humanitarian truce in the Middle East. 
 "That position is jointly endorsed by both countries and majority of the countries in the world," said Datuk Seri Anwar. 
 PM Lee added that both Singapore and Malaysia have expressed their respective views on the conflict.
 "Singapore has made repeated statements about this, and condemned what's happening... and hoping that the two parties can make progress towards a negotiated two-state solution to the Middle East," he said.
 On Malaysia, PM Lee said: "Their situation is not the same as ours because we have diplomatic relations with Israel.
 "But at the same time, we have friendly relations with the Palestine authority."
 He noted that Malaysia has very friendly relations with the Palestinian Authority, but no diplomatic relations with Israel. 
 "So the diplomatic situation is not identical, but there's no reason for that to cause a difficulty between Malaysia and Singapore," said PM Lee.
 The two leaders made the comments when asked by the media what specific approaches their countries would take to ensure that their reactions to the Israel-Hamas war and the ground sentiments do not have spillover effects, especially on mutual investments, bilateral cooperation and longstanding ties.
 Mr Anwar said what is critical for now is peace, and to stop the killings of civilians, babies and women. He added that he has been in touch with many Arab leaders and has expressed Malaysia's support for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
 Mr Anwar was in Singapore from Sunday for the 10th Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat at the invitation of PM Lee.
 The two-day retreat, which is a key annual platform for the prime ministers to meet and discuss bilateral issues, is the first one to be held since the Covid-19 pandemic hit.
 The retreat comes as Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group launched a surprise cross-border attack in southern Israel on Oct 7 that killed around 1,400 people. Israel has since begun a bombardment of Gaza, where the death toll has climbed to 7,650, according to a report last Saturday by the Palestinian Health Ministry.
 On Sunday, Singapore's Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said the Republic took a clear stand and expressed its concerns on the grave situation in Gaza by supporting the UN resolution last Friday calling for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce.
 He said Singapore cast a "very major vote" in support of the non-binding resolution drafted by the Arab states, which received 121 votes in favour, 14 against and 44 abstentions.

Blocking aid from reaching Gaza could be a war crime: ICC

Byline: , Blocking aid from reaching Gaza could be a war crime: ICC
Body


Cairo The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has warned that blocking humanitarian aid from entering Gaza could constitute a crime, adding that obligations to comply with the laws of conflict apply to both Israel and Hamas.
 "Impeding relief supplies as provided by the Geneva Conventions may constitute a crime within the court jurisdiction," Mr Karim Khan told reporters in Cairo on Sunday.
 Mr Khan said his office had an ongoing investigation into "any crimes committed on the territory of Palestine and any crimes committed, whether it's by Israel and Palestine or whether it's acts committed on the territory of Palestine or from Palestine into Israel".
 "This includes current events in Gaza and also current events in the West Bank," he added.
 He was speaking after a visit to Egypt's Rafah crossing, where he said trucks full of desperately needed goods remained stuck and unable to cross into Gaza.
 "I saw trucks full of goods, full of humanitarian assistance stuck where nobody needs them, stuck in Egypt, stuck at Rafah," he said. "These supplies must get to the civilians of Gaza without delay."
 Rafah is the only entry point through which international aid is currently able to trickle into the Hamas-run Palestinian territory, which is facing a near-total siege and relentless Israeli bombardment.
 Israel imposed the siege and unleashed its massive bombing campaign after Hamas gunmen stormed across the border on Oct 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and seizing 230 hostages, according to Israeli officials.
 Israel's strikes have since killed more than 8,000 people, half of them children, the Hamas-controlled health ministry in the territory said.
 The United Nations reported that 33 trucks carrying water, food and medical supplies had entered Gaza on Sunday -- bringing to 117 the total that have entered through the Rafah crossing since the resumption of aid deliveries on Oct 21.
 Prior to the siege, some 500 trucks carrying aid and other goods entered Gaza every day.
 Mr Khan said he wanted "to underline clearly to Israel that there must be discernible efforts without further delay to make sure civilians (in Gaza) receive basic food, medicines".
 On Sunday, the UN warned it feared a breakdown of public order after looting at food aid centres in Gaza run by its agency for Palestinian refugees, the UNRWA.
 UN chief Antonio Guterres said the situation was "growing more desperate by the hour" as casualty numbers increase and essential supplies of food, water, medicine and shelter dwindle.
 Mr Khan said he was "very concerned also by the spike in the number of reported incidents of attack by settlers against Palestinian civilians" in the territory Israel has occupied since 1967.
 He also stressed that hostage-taking was a breach of the Geneva Conventions, saying: "I call for the immediate release of all hostages taken from Israel and for their safe return to their families." 
 The British lawyer said "Israel has clear obligations in relation to its war with Hamas, not just moral obligations but legal obligations" to comply with the laws of conflict. 
 "These principles equally apply to Hamas in relation to firing indiscriminate rockets into Israel," he added.
 Set up in 2002, the ICC is the only global independent tribunal to probe the world's worst crimes including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
 The Palestinians signed up to the court's founding Rome Statute in 2015.
 Israel, which like the United States, China and Russia, is not a signatory to the ICC, has refused to cooperate with the probe or recognise its jurisdiction.
 In March, the ICC issued a warrant of arrest against Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of illegally deporting at least 100 children from Ukraine during the ongoing conflict between the two nations that started in September 2022.
 The move will obligate the court's 123 member states to arrest Mr Putin and transfer him to The Hague for trial if he sets foot on their territory.
 Moscow has not concealed a programme under which it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia, but presents it as a humanitarian campaign to protect orphans and children abandoned in the conflict zone. AFP

What international law has to say about the Israel-Hamas war

Byline: Jonathan Eyal Global, What international law has to say about the Israel-Hamas war
Body


As Israel extends its ground offensive against the Hamas militant organisation in Gaza, one refrain is heard around the world: Nothing in international law -- not even the Oct 7 murder by Hamas of 1,400 Israelis, many of them defenceless civilians -- justifies the bloodshed Israel is now inflicting on the Palestinians. 
 The plea comes not only from Israel's traditional critics but also from the Jewish state's closest friends. 
 Israel, United States President Joe Biden said after a phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, "has every right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism". 
 But, Mr Biden added, it must do so "in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law that prioritises the protection of civilians".
 Other world leaders have gone even further, accusing Israel of "war crimes". 
 "Of course, every country has the right to defend itself," Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told a crowd of over one million protesters in Ankara, the capital, over the weekend. 
 "But where is the justice in this case? There is no justice -- just a vicious massacre happening in Gaza," he thundered.
 The suffering of the people of Gaza is not in doubt. As Mr Burhan Gafoor, Singapore's Ambassador to the United Nations, told the UN General Assembly last week, everyone agrees that "this is a massive humanitarian crisis".
 Still, the debate on whether Israel is violating principles enshrined in the laws of war is far from clear-cut. 
 And it is not made easier by the general lack of knowledge about what international law says about the conduct of war. 
 It is striking that most of those opining about Israel's duty to protect civilians usually fall silent when asked how Israel can do that while fighting an outfit like Hamas, whose entire strategy consists of hiding among the civilian population.
 As Lord Macdonald, Britain's former director of public prosecutions, and Lord Pannick, one of Britain's most eminent lawyers, remarked recently: "Just as war attracts armchair generals, so it attracts lawyers who find violations of international law from the safety of their chambers without regard to basic legal principles of self-defence."
 Myths and inaccuracies abound.
 Critics allege, for instance, that Israel does not care either about international law or the mass killing of Palestinian civilians. 
 But even if Israel's military commanders were heartless individuals oblivious to the bloodshed they inflict, one does not need to be a great strategy expert to work out that the bombing of Palestinian hospitals or schools gives Israel a terrible international image, and this has a direct impact on Israel's military operations.
 Every single war or military offensive Israel launched over the past two decades had to be stopped earlier than Israel wanted and with less favourable results than Israel hoped for because of pressure from the international community about the extent of civilian casualties. 
 So, if only for operational reasons, it is not in Israel's interests to inflict high civilian casualties.
 Hostage taking and  right to self-defenceAnd then, there is the myth of Hamas as a genuine representative of the Palestinian people, an organisation with which one can supposedly negotiate ceasefires, or "humanitarian corridors". 
 None of this is true. As its action earlier in October indicates, Hamas and its supporters seek the destruction of Israel (a mission laid down in its founding charter) and the murder of Jews who stand in the way.
 Hamas' butchering of children, the torturing of victims and the seizing of over 200 people -- adult and children alike -- amount to the gravest breaches of the Geneva Conventions, the treaties that govern the conduct of wars, which explicitly ban "murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture... taking of hostages... outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment". 
 Israel has a clear right in international law -- and, one could argue, even a duty -- to respond in the self-defence of its citizens. 
 It has also an explicit right to dismantle the Hamas organisation itself and hit at those who enable its military operations. The critical question is how it does so.
 A common misconception in looking at the legal implications of the current Gaza war is the idea that the laws of war are about preventing war and that they prohibit the killing of civilians. Neither is true.
 Indeed, the reality is precisely the opposite: the very existence of laws of war is an admission that, in some instances, war is necessary; laws are designed to ensure that when war must be conducted, there are limits on what harm can be done.
 All acts of self-defence entail some violence and invariably involve the killing of civilians. 
 The real question is whether the party carrying out this violence has any plausible alternative in the face of an enemy bent upon its destruction.
 Proportionality and ban  on collective punishmentOne of the foremost tenets of international law -- dating back to theories of "just law" centuries ago -- is the notion that there are limits to what can be done in war, that combatants are legitimate targets while civilians are not. 
 The 1949 Geneva Conventions, the 1977 Geneva Protocol, the 1980 UN Convention and the 1997 Ottawa Convention all affirm that the "means of warfare is not unlimited" and that "methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering" are prohibited. 
 In addition to such broad humanitarian principles, two other rules have emerged in the conduct of war: the idea of proportionality and the ban on collective punishment.
 Critics of Israel say its actions in Gaza violate both these principles. 
 It is argued that Israel's intense bombing of targets in Gaza is disproportionate both in terms of the people it targets and the number of civilian casualties it produces.
 According to the rule of proportionality, no more force may be used than is necessary to achieve a legitimate military objective. 
 It is also said that Israel's decision to cut off supplies of fuel, electricity and water to Gaza, as well as Israeli orders to Gazan civilians to move from the northern to the southern part of the Strip, amount to collective punishment.
 All weighty arguments. But, the legal case is far more complex than it first appears.
 It is easy to throw around the word "proportionate", but far more difficult to discuss its application in this context beyond just repeating it as a slogan.
 What proportionality meansDoes the principle of proportionality mean, for instance, that Israel is "entitled" to kill only 1,400 Palestinian civilians, the same number Hamas killed in Israel? Media coverage and Hamas propaganda encourage us to believe in this straight numerical comparison. 
 The Health Ministry in Gaza -- a Hamas outfit -- constantly releases numbers on civilians killed, casualty figures which mysteriously do not include even one Hamas fighter. 
 Their chief purpose is to generate headlines such as "8,000 Palestinian fatalities versus 1,400 Israelis dead," a comparison that automatically leads us to conclude that the Israeli action is disproportionate.
 Yet, in international law terms, such numerical comparisons are irrelevant; the legal test of proportionality does not mean that Israel's response has to be equal to the force used in the armed attack against Israel. 
 Proportionality means that a government can use power that is proportionate to the defensive objective, which in the current Gaza war is to stop, repel and prevent further Hamas attacks.
 Proportionality also applies to the law that governs the conduct of hostilities. The law of armed conflict requires that in every attack posing a risk to civilian life, that risk must not be excessive to the anticipated military advantage.
 Israel claims that it respects this principle and that in every attack it undertakes, it makes a careful calculation about the risks to Palestinian civilians, as measured against the Israeli objective of destroying Hamas.
 But it is here that Israel may be transgressing international law, for the Israeli test of proportionality appears to concern only the objective of achieving Israel's strategic aims, and that could justify a far higher number of civilian Palestinian casualties than any international lawyer would consider acceptable.
 The military advantage of every operation needs to be balanced against the risk of civilian casualties, even if the vital interests of Israel are at stake. 
 And it is not apparent that Israel is applying this criterion. 
 Still, it is worth recalling that the legal rule of proportionality does not mean, even when scrupulously observed, that civilians will not lose their lives in an armed conflict. 
 And the most significant challenge in this conflict is that Hamas is the kind of opponent that cynically exploits these rules by putting civilians in harm's way. 
 So, an analysis of applying the rules on proportionality in this conflict must also consider this fact.
 Cutting off essential suppliesAnd what about collective punishment? 
 Israel's claim that it is ordering the population of northern Gaza to move to minimise civilian casualties may be acceptable in international law. 
 But the wholesale clearing of civilians without providing them with adequate food and shelter or, indeed, without offering any guarantee that civilians will not be attacked in southern Gaza is not permissible in international law.
 Nor is Israel's refusal to allow sufficient quantities of humanitarian supplies into Gaza. 
 Yes, Hamas abused the Palestinian people, using their grievous suffering as cover for its activities. There is, therefore, no question that Hamas is secretly holding its own stocks of fuel and food, which it refuses to share with local people. 
 But this is not a sufficient justification for Israel to refuse food supplies to Gaza's civilians.
 But even here, matters are not clear-cut. For instance, Britain's official manual on the law of armed conflict claims that blocking and besieging an enemy town that is fortified and defended by cutting off its supplies of food and other necessities "is a legitimate method of warfare".
 Only if the enemy town is undefended would such a siege be considered illegal, "since it could be occupied without resistance".
 As professor of international law Guglielmo Verdirame of King's College London recently pointed out: "Gaza is not an undefended town." 
 So, while it is true that civilians caught within an area that is being encircled should be offered humanitarian relief, "it is not correct to say that encircling an area with civilians in it is not permitted by the laws of war", said Prof Verdirame.
 In short, and at least as far as a literal interpretation of international law is concerned, Israel can besiege Gaza City or, indeed, the whole Gaza Strip, provided it made special provisions for civilians. And this may well include allowing the "humanitarian corridors" the UN currently demands.
 None of this is to justify all of Israel's military actions or the country's overall behaviour. 
 Nor should these legal arguments, however complicated, divert attention away from the terrible suffering of the Palestinians. 
 But the reality remains that the prohibitions of the laws of war are far less evident than currently presented. 
 And it is a fact that at least some criticism addressed at Israel belongs more to the realms of politics and propaganda rather than the law.

Beware revival of Cold War mentality: Chinese general

Body


BEIJING  The world must guard against a resurgence of a "Cold War mentality", warned China's top general Zhang Youxia on Monday, as he criticised the actions of the United States and reiterated calls for peace talks between Israel and Hamas. 
 Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum, he accused "some countries" -- without naming them -- of having a zero-sum mindset, forming cliques and promoting unilateralism through erecting barriers.
 Viewing the development of others as a threat and economic inter-dependence as a risk will not make lives better, nor contribute to progress, said Gen Zhang -- likely a reference to American moves to curb Chinese access to advanced technology that can be used in military applications.
 The great power rivalry between the US and China has shown no signs of abating, even as meetings between top officials from both sides -- barring those between military leaders -- have steadily resumed in recent months.
 Regarding military dialogue between the two nations, which has been suspended for more than a year after then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, Gen Zhang said China was willing to develop these ties "on the basis of mutual respect, peaceful co-existence and win-win cooperation".
 The US and other Western allied countries, such as Britain and Canada, sent lower-level delegations to the three-day security conference, a major military diplomacy event for Beijing which sees it as a platform to share its views on international security issues.
 The US delegation is headed by Ms Xanthi Carras, principal director in the office of the deputy assistant secretary of defence for China, Taiwan and Mongolia.
 For China, Gen Zhang, vice-chairman of the country's military high command, has stepped in to play key diplomatic roles at the event alongside the other Central Military Commission vice-chairman, General He Weidong, in the absence of a defence minister. They are ranked No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, in the military hierarchy after President Xi Jinping.
 The previous defence minister, General Li Shangfu, was removed from the position earlier in October with no replacement named, a month after multiple reports said he was being investigated for corruption.
 Gen Zhang gave welcome remarks at an opening dinner on Sunday. Gen Zhang and Gen He also held separate bilateral meetings over the weekend with their counterparts from visiting countries such as Belarus, Cambodia and Vietnam.
 On Monday, Gen Zhang said the world should redouble its efforts to eliminate wars and conflicts, referencing the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.
 "China upholds an objective and fair stance, supports the political settlement of the Ukrainian issue, and calls on all parties to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict to cease fire immediately and resume peace talks at an early date," he said.
 He called China's brokering of a historic deal between bitter rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in March "a victory for dialogue and peace". The deal resulted in the restoration of diplomatic ties between Riyadh and Teheran.
 "The top priority is to prevent regional hot spots from escalating," he said, adding that the geopolitical situation today is "severe" -- in part due to the efforts of "some countries" to interfere in the internal affairs of others, and instigate "colour revolutions", a term that China has used to describe movements to topple a government with the support of a foreign power.
 On Taiwan, which Beijing views as an inviolable part of its territory, Gen Zhang did not waver. He stressed that the Taiwan question is "at the heart of China's core interests", and the "one China" principle is the general consensus of the international community.
 "You cannot base your own safety on the insecurity of others, not to mention deliberately provoking on major sensitive issues," he said. "No matter who wants to separate Taiwan from China in any form, the Chinese military will never agree and will not show mercy."
 The latest edition of the Xiangshan forum, last held in 2019, has drawn more than 500 representatives from some 90 countries and international organisations. Organisers said this was a record number of participants, including more than 30 ministerial-level representatives and military chiefs.
 Singapore's delegation is headed by Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, who is expected to give a speech at the event, which is being held at the Beijing International Convention Centre. He is also expected to call on Gen He and other senior officials from the People's Liberation Army.

Scandal-hit Netanyahu fighting war on both ends

Body


LONDON Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeks to present himself as a national leader no longer interested in petty domestic politics, as the nation's troops extend their ground offensive into Gaza. 
 "We are now at war, focused on the war," Mr Netanyahu's spokesman claimed at the start of the week.
 But the 74-year-old Prime Minister's appeals for national unity are falling on deaf ears, as he continues to deny responsibility for the security situation.
 Evidence has emerged that some of his Cabinet ministers are pushing to expand the objectives of the current war to permanently occupying Gaza and expelling Palestinians. 
 The Israeli government has always denied having the intention of permanently occupying Gaza.
 As a result, Mr Netanyahu is the first prime minister in Israel's history to face public demands for his resignation during a grave national emergency.
 The Oct 7 surprise attack by Hamas is regarded as one of the Jewish state's worst intelligence failures.
 Those who were supposed to track Hamas and anticipate the Palestinian militant group's actions have already offered their public apologies for this failure.
 Major-General Aharon Haliva, the head of Israel's Military Intelligence Directorate, sent a letter to soldiers under his command, saying: "We failed to live up to our most important mission, and I bear full responsibility."
 Mr Ronen Bar, the head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic security service, delivered the same message to his staff. "Despite a series of steps we had undertaken," he said, "we were unable to provide an adequate warning to enable the attack to be thwarted. As the one who heads the organisation, the responsibility for this is on me."
 And in an even more remarkable admission of responsibility, General Herzl Halevi, the overall commander of all the Israeli armed forces, told soldiers that the military, collectively, "did not live up" to its chief responsibility to provide "for the security of the state and its citizens".
 Mr Netanyahu studiously avoided any personal admission of responsibility, arguing instead that he "would give answers" only at the end of the current war.
 Yet, this did not prevent him from tweeting on X -- formerly known as Twitter -- over the weekend, when he claimed he had not received any warning about Hamas' impending attack.
 "Under no circumstances and at no stage was Prime Minister Netanyahu warned about Hamas intending to go to war," read the tweet, posted under his name, which then went on to shift blame to Israel's security community for the intelligence failure.
 The backlash was immediate, particularly among Israel's military establishment.
 "Netanyahu is on the campaign trail," a senior military source who refused to be named told Haaretz, one of Israel's top newspapers.
 Mr Netanyahu "has been gathering materials against the army and explaining, in backgrounders, why he isn't guilty and how the intelligence didn't reach him", the anonymous source added, calling the Prime Minister's behaviour "disgraceful".
 A strong rebuke also came from Mr Benny Gantz, the opposition leader who, in a bid for national unity, agreed to join the government for the duration of the war.
 "The Prime Minister must retract his remarks and cease dealing with this issue," Mr Gantz demanded.
 Public outrage forced Mr Netanyahu to withdraw his tweet and apologise to Israel's defence establishment.
 "I was wrong," Mr Netanyahu wrote on X on Sunday.
 But he is already embroiled in another scandal, as evidence begins to emerge that he and his far-right ministers are pushing for an expansion of the current war aims from just the destruction of Hamas.
 Officials close to the Prime Minister are arguing that Hamas would not have existed if Israel had not ended its occupation of Gaza 18 years ago. The implication is that a permanent reoccupation of the strip is the only solution to the problem.
 Media reports also suggest that in recent Cabinet meetings, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, an extremist previously convicted of supporting an anti-Arab Jewish outfit listed as a terrorist organisation, has argued that Israel must annex either the northern part or all of Gaza.
 A 10-page policy paper prepared by Israel's Intelligence Ministry was also leaked to the media, envisaging nothing less than the expulsion of Gaza's entire 2.2 million population of Palestinians, who will then be moved to neighbouring Egypt.
 Despite its grand-sounding name, Israel's Intelligence Ministry is a phantom institution established by Mr Netanyahu in an attempt to find a job for one of his close associates.
 So, there are serious doubts about the significance of this document.
 Still, it is clear that, far from being deterred by the current disaster, some of Mr Netanyahu's Cabinet colleagues seem determined to push for even harsher measures against the Palestinians.
 And it is equally clear that he proposes to do nothing to tame the behaviour of his more extreme colleagues.

India's balancing act amid Gaza conflict

Body


NEW DELHI  As the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues, India will need to walk a fine line to balance its support for Israel while protecting its vast and deep links with the Arab world, said analysts. 
 India has not departed from its longstanding position of a negotiated two-state solution for Israel and Palestine as peaceful neighbours, but it has expressed strong solidarity with Israel. 
 Hours after Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7, killing more than 1,400 and taking over 200 people hostage, Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attacks in a tweet and said India stands with Israel. He repeated this in a phone call with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu three days later. 
 On Friday, India abstained from voting on a United Nations resolution that called for a humanitarian truce and ceasefire in Gaza, where medical authorities have said over 8,000 people have been killed following Israel's retaliatory strikes.
 New Delhi defended its decision, saying the resolution did not include "explicit condemnation" of the Hamas attack. This drew criticism against India for not taking a stand on Gaza and expressing concern over the Israeli air strikes.
 India's abstention "has isolated it from the rest of the Global South", said Dr Hasan Alhasan, a research fellow for Middle East policy at the London-based think-tank International Institute for Strategic Studies.
 He noted perceptions that India stands "squarely on the side of Israel" in the Gaza conflict, and "was very slow to rebalance its position". 
 "It took the Ministry of External Affairs five days from the start of the conflict to reiterate India's traditional policy favouring a two-state solution," he said. The ministry on Oct 12 said that India "has always advocated the resumption of direct negotiations towards establishing a sovereign, independent, and viable State of Palestine".
 In what many see as an attempt to balance the country's position, Mr Modi also spoke about Gaza to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Oct 19, Jordan's King Abdullah on Oct 23, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Oct 28.
 In 2017, Mr Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel, a historic occasion some 25 years after the two countries established diplomatic relations.
 Ties with Israel have grown on the back of cooperation in security and defence, with India accounting for 37 per cent of Israel's weapons exports between 2018 and 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
 However, India has also developed strong ties with the Arab world in the past decade, noted Professor Harsh V. Pant of the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. 
 Should the war be protracted, there would "certainly" be an expectation in many Arab countries that India would support their position on this crisis, said Prof Pant, who is vice-president for studies and foreign policy at the think-tank. 
 "And given the huge stakes India has in the Arab world, India will have to consider those expectations as well in how it evolves its position on this issue," he said. 
 India imports 60 per cent of its crude oil from the Gulf countries, where some 8.8 million Indians employed in various sectors remitted home about US$90 billion (S$123 billion) in 2022 alone. 
 Arab countries have condemned the killing and targeting of civilians in Gaza and have consistently supported the need for a two-state solution.
 India's alignment with Israel is in part linked to the Modi government's policy of being tough on terror. 
 Right-wing nationalists have drawn a parallel between the Hamas attack and repeated cross-border terror attacks that India has accused Pakistan of. In 2008, terrorists from Pakistan launched attacks on multiple sites in Mumbai, leaving 175 dead. 
 In the Indian public's view, Israel is a friend that stepped in during a time of need, supplying weapons during the 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan.
  Israel's ambassador to India Naor Gilon told news agency ANI that there had been overwhelming support from Indians.
 "Everyone is telling me, I want to volunteer and I want to go and fight for Israel," he said, adding that he "could have another IDF with volunteers", referring to the the Israeli Defence Forces.
 Mr Talmiz Ahmad, a former Indian ambassador to Saudi Arabia and an Arab expert, said India's ties with Arab countries are too deep and varied to be impacted adversely by India's position on Israel. 
 "I don't think any country in the region will have any different relations with India because of Israel," he said. 
 Despite support for Israel in India, there has also been an upsurge of sympathy over the loss of lives and the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza. 
 Pro-Palestine protests have been held, including in the southern state of Kerala.

Military interaction vital to avoid physical conflict in Asia: Ng Eng Hen

Body


BEIJING  Singapore's Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen on Tuesday stressed the importance of engagement between military leaders, saying that their most critical task in this coming decade is to avoid a physical conflict in Asia.
 Speaking at the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum, Dr Ng referenced ongoing wars in Europe and the Middle East, and said interaction between military establishments is vital to avoiding miscalculations and mishaps.
 Simultaneous conflicts in Asia, Europe and the Middle East would be catastrophic for the world, he warned. 
 "A physical conflict in Asia, whatever the rationale or precipitating cause, will be devastating. We must do all we can to avoid it," he told the audience.
 The Xiangshan forum is a high-level security conference akin to Singapore's Shangri-La Dialogue. It is attended by defence chiefs, academics and representatives from international organisations.
 Dr Ng's remarks come after an outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas -- which has led to increased tensions along religious lines in other countries -- in addition to the war in Ukraine. His call also comes as top military leaders from the United States and China have not met in more than a year since then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022, a move that had angered Beijing.
 In another development that adds to the complication, China has yet to name a new defence minister after US-sanctioned Li Shangfu was removed on Oct 24. General Li was reportedly investigated for corruption. In China, the defence minister leads military diplomatic engagements, such as meetings with foreign defence leaders.
 Open channels of communication such as hotlines can make a difference, especially in moments of crisis, said Dr Ng at a plenary session titled Asia-Pacific Security Architecture: Present and Future.
 He noted that Singapore and China signed an agreement in June 2023 to work towards the establishment of a secure defence telephone link. 
 The US and China have similar bilateral defence lines established, and the hope is that they will find an arrangement to use these lines effectively, he said.
 While a "G-2" scenario where the US and China each dominate half of the world in geopolitical influence is fantasy, the world would not be better off if either superpower declines, Dr Ng said.
 "We need both a strong US and a strong China if we are to effectively address global challenges."
 What is needed is political commitment and hard work from both countries to improve relations, he said, adding that their differences in ideology, and political and value systems will continue to exist.
 The troubled US-China relationship has shown signs of thawing. 
 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on US President Joe Biden in Washington last Friday, which was seen to pave the way for a meeting between Mr Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November. 
 Dr Ng said China can do more to promote stability in both the region and globally. It must continue to grow economically and further integrate its markets with the rest of the world.
 "Yes, it will get harder because of the prevailing climate of distrust and strategic competition. But I believe that China has indigenous strengths that it can draw from, particularly its strengths in Stem capabilities," he said, referring to the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
 China must also continue to promote multilateralism and uphold the rule of law. That is the greatest assurance to other nations, big or small, that China's growth is inclusive and will lift all boats, he said.
 Additionally, China, including its military, must lead to reduce tensions in the region. "Whether China accepts it or not, it is already seen as a dominant power and must therefore act as a benevolent one," he added.
 On the sidelines of the forum, Dr Ng called on the vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, General He Weidong, on Tuesday. During the meeting, Dr Ng and Gen He reaffirmed the warm and friendly bilateral and defence relationships between Singapore and China, and exchanged views on regional security issues of mutual interest.

Israel-Hamas conflict risks getting lost in the digital fog of war

In October, Hamas blamed an Israeli air strike for an explosion at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza in which scores of people were killed, apparently in an adjacent carpark which provided shelter. 
 This claim was initially widely shared by international news outlets and Arab leaders across the Middle East, sparking massive protests in the region and beyond.
 Israel denied responsibility for the attack, but it took hours for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) to process data and intelligence showing the hospital was damaged by a misfired rocket by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), an armed group operating alongside Hamas in Gaza. 
 IDF published drone footage showing the before and after of the failed rocket strike, along with its analysis, and intercepted a voice recording of a PIJ conversation acknowledging the misfire.
 United States, British, French and Canadian intelligence assessments later publicly concluded the same, finding the explosion was likely caused by a missile, or part of one, launched from within Gaza towards Israel.
 Yet, none of these statements has changed some mindsets around the world that Israel is to blame for the attack, and for the deadly incursion into Israel by Hamas militants on Oct 7 that preceded the outbreak of hostilities in Gaza.
 Fog of warThe confusion over responsibility for the hospital bombing illustrates the chilling effects of the digital fog of war. It has become hard for anyone to figure out what is truly going on.
 At its core, the digital fog of war concerns the challenges around owning, designing and defending one's war story. There are contending narratives, debates and varying political, technical and military analyses, all of which aim to support opposing versions of events. These amplify uncertainty and call into question the legitimacy of any military action taken.
 This manipulation of reality through social media algorithms is reinforced by collective biases. Nearly every event is constructed and reinterpreted through multiple lenses with varying levels of reliability, blurring our understanding of the situation at any given time. 
 A compelling example is the narrative of denial on social media channels that clouded the tragic deaths of two small boys -- one, a Palestinian, Omar Bilal al-Banna, who was killed following an Israeli air strike on Zeitoun, east of Gaza City; and the other an Israeli, Omer Siman-Tov, who was killed, along with his parents and sister, in the Hamas attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct 7.
 Pro-Israeli accounts on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, wrongly asserted that Omar was not a dead Palestinian child, but a doll. Meanwhile, pro-Palestinian supporters accused Israel of using paid actors and made false claims that Omer and his family were crisis actors paid to act out a tragedy. 
 The wide dissemination of disinformation since the early 1990s with the advent of the Internet is hardly news. Yet advances in digital technology and the proliferation of smartphones have since quickened news cycles, enabling impressions to be formed and entrenched rapidly. 
 No matter what Israel does in the next weeks or months, world opinion will likely be divided about its war aims and conduct in Gaza. Constantly having to expend bandwidth to decide which visuals, reports or online accounts to trust can create fatigue and lead people to switch off. Existing mindsets and bias, rather than developments in the conflict, may then shape international public opinion.
 With battalions of armoured, artillery and infantry looking ready to storm Gaza, Israel must be careful not to be seen as the proverbial Goliath, notwithstanding the brutal Hamas onslaught in southern Israel on Oct 7.
 The IDF must fight on two fronts simultaneously: on the physical battlefield in and around Gaza, and on the terrain of international public opinion, which shapes strategic and political decision-making. 
 Achieving victory on the physical front -- even amid the maze of Hamas tunnels in Gaza, and the challenges of urban warfare -- may be the easier task. Breaking through the digital fog of war, controlling the war narrative and shaping public perceptions less so.
 International political support for Israel in the aftermath of the Oct 7 attack is already fragile, as shown in the result of the United Nations General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza on Friday. The resolution was passed with 120 votes in favour, and 45 abstentions. Fourteen countries -- including Israel and the US -- voted no. 
 Shift towards cognitive warfareFighting for hearts and minds, and winning the informational battlefield are objectives the IDF recognises to be critical for the legitimacy of its military actions. 
 In recent years, the IDF has stepped up strategies for cognitive warfare. It recognises that international perceptions of Israel's right to self-defence must be preserved to create the political space for military operations. 
 In essence, the IDF is trying to control strategic narratives through targeted messaging across the digital and information sphere aimed at the Israeli public and the international community. 
 It employs a model of centralised coordination of key narratives and the decentralised flow of information between its intelligence, public relations, diplomatic and political channels, to tackle fast-moving misinformation.
 In August 2015, the IDF published its first-ever public defence doctrine, which outlines the military's strategic and operational responses to key threats facing Israel. The strategy envisions a multidimensional approach to defence against simultaneous attacks on several fronts -- military, economic, legal, media and political. 
 While the multi-domain battle is an appealing strategic concept, militaries, including the IDF, have often struggled to align their information campaigns with the conduct of military operations.
 For example, during the Operation Guardian of the Walls against Hamas in 2021, the IDF had not sufficiently utilised intelligence materials in a timely way to support its information campaign, nor presented the aims of the operation clearly to the Israeli public. 
 As a result, despite the IDF achieving its military aim of disabling Hamas' ability to launch rocket strikes at Israel by taking out key sites, most of Israeli society thought the operation was unnecessary. 
 It is still too soon to ascertain how the IDF is faring on the cognitive front in the current war with Hamas. Controlling or changing the narrative of war amid the deluge of misinformation, while maintaining domestic political unity and the military support of allies, will be a complex task for the Israeli authorities.
 Hamas' fog of warLikewise, Hamas has adapted its tactics, employing not only more creative weaponry on the battlefield -- paragliders, kamikaze drones and hit-and-run motorcycle battalions -- but also an information campaign to win the hearts and minds of its supporters.
 Hamas has traditionally relied on propaganda campaigns aimed primarily at Palestinians in Gaza through TV and radio stations, such as the Al-Aqsa stations, which have continuously pumped out the message of Israeli oppression of Palestinians to reinforce radicalisation and recruitment. 
 On the digital front, although Hamas has been banned from social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, it is still able to reach tens of millions through accounts sympathetic to the group like Gaza Now on Telegram. 
 Through the production and dissemination of graphic images and videos of violence intended to manipulate emotions, such accounts seek to stoke divisions, and ultimately motivate calls for more acts of violence against Israel.
 Some visuals are realistic renditions manufactured by artificial intelligence (AI). Last week, a haunting photo of a distraught baby appearing to be crawling through the rubble in Gaza spread online. It was later analysed and confirmed to be an AI-generated image, a troubling sign of what damage generative AI can wreak in this digital fog of war. 
 The image of Palestinian oppression and continuous violence is reflected also in the coverage of friendly television networks such as the Qatar-backed Al-Jazeera, which has termed its coverage The War on Gaza. 
 Cost of losing the  battle of narrativesIn the history of war, owning the narrative has always been an essential element of post-war success. Amid the accelerating digital fog, however, the war story is constantly contested. This has deeper implications for the conduct of war and could curtail the manoeuvring space for the political and military leadership. 
 Despite significant military commitments this time around, Israel may not be able to achieve an absolute and decisive victory on the battlefield. At some point, major powers may intervene to freeze the conflict or initiate a ceasefire because of fears of escalation and risks of a broader war in the Middle East. 
 That risk is greater today. Under a digital fog of war, Hamas and its supporters can shift perceptions of its acts of mass terror by mixing it with narratives of the Palestinians' legitimate right to statehood and human rights.
 In all, the biggest casualty of the digital fog of war is truth. Without a consensus on what is reality, even a legitimate right to self-defence that conforms to international law can be vilified and dismissed. The Israel-Hamas war should thus be a wake-up call to armed forces, defence planners and intelligence communities, who must retool their approaches for maximum agility, resilience and proactive defence.

Israel-Hamas war will have impact on S-E Asia: NTU prof

The Israel-Hamas war will have geopolitical consequences for South-east Asia, said international affairs scholar Joseph Liow. 
 In South-east Asia, there have been extremist groups motivated by events in the Middle East and many of these groups have previously identified the plight of the Palestinians as an issue they want to agitate support for, he said. 
 This is going to create challenges when it comes to security and the relationships between communities, which would be something "to keep an eye on", said Professor Liow. 
 He was speaking during a question-and-answer  session on Wednesday, held at the Institute of Policy Studies' (IPS) 13th IPS-Nathan Lecture Series, on South-east Asia in a Shifting Global Order: Grasping the Nettle or Groping in the Dark'
 Prof Liow, who is dean of Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, said political leaders in Asean seeking to deepen ties with the US will face difficulties if sentiments on the ground turn against Washington.
 "The United States has never been an unequivocally welcomed power in our region in the first place, in many countries.... a hangover of things that happened 20 years ago, the aftermath of 9/11, in particular Afghanistan and Iraq... is still very fresh in the minds of many Malaysians and Indonesians, and I think that script is going to play out again, and that is going to create difficulties for the leaders of these countries," he said.
 Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, for example, openly supports the Palestinians and has said that Malaysia condemns Israel's unlawful occupation of Palestine.
 War broke out after Hamas on Oct 7 launched a surprise attack killing 1,400 people in Israel, which retaliated with extensive airstrikes and has launched a ground offensive in Gaza.   
 Prof Liow said Datuk Seri Anwar's long-standing support for the Palestinian cause is "perfectly understandable", but problems will arise if the Malaysian government wants to openly cooperate with the US. 
 "It was an issue 20 years ago, right? The Malaysian government was very keen on furthering their relationship with the United States, but the people were very anti-US because of the Iraq invasion, and they had to manage it," he recalled. 
 "The challenge for our neighbours today is that the domestic political configuration today is far more brutal than it was 20 years ago, so that will be particularly tricky." 
 Speaking at the National University of Singapore's Shaw Foundation Alumni House, he outlined how the world is "at a crossroads, as various political, social, and economic forces contrive to push back against unbridled globalisation and interdependence, in the process, undermining the prevailing Global Order".
 He said "continued American disinterest in global trade will invariably affect South-east Asia, a region that is deeply plugged into international trading networks". 
 Asean would also have to grapple with "institutional balancing" -- efforts by China to create new institutions to challenge American leadership and dominance of prevailing ones. 
 This would potentially affect Asean, "putatively the premier institution for South-east Asia".
 Prof Liow also talked about how Myanmar's military coup has "somewhat divided" Asean.
 Asean is "trying to stick very closely" to the five-point consensus reached with the Myanmar junta in 2021, but "the junta at this point doesn't seem too interested", he said.
 The five points are, namely, an immediate end to violence in Myanmar; dialogue among all parties; the appointment of a special envoy; humanitarian assistance by Asean; and the special envoy's visit to Myanmar to meet all parties. 
 Prof Liow noted that the junta's position remains that "until we resolve the violence, we're not going to be able to talk about this" and the Thais had, for their own reasons, started parallel discussions with Myanmar. 
 "I'm not sure about the extent of coordination between the Thai process and the Asean process, but there really should be efforts to try to, if not align, at least to synchronise and build on each other's efforts," he added. 
 Prof Liow also said it is not easy for Asean member states to agree and move forward as a group. 
 "Why is it you need so many meetings on the Asean calendar? Look at the issues that Asean wants to tackle, and look at the reality that... you have 10 countries probably coming at the same issue from 10 different positions. It is not easy to get everyone to the same destination."

Past lies about Middle East wars get in the way of truth today

Body


Mr Moshe Lavi, whose relatives have been taken hostage by Hamas, recently talked to a group of journalists from The New York Times about his family's agony. 
 His pained voice turned to anger when he recounted encountering disbelief that Hamas committed terrible atrocities when it attacked Israel. Mr Lavi seemed especially bewildered by people "arguing over the semantics" of whether people were beheaded or their heads fell off, or even whether there were hostages in Gaza.
 In one particularly gruesome twist, there's been an uproar over whether Hamas had beheaded babies -- an unverified claim that US President Joe Biden repeated before the White House walked back on it, and that has been subject to much discussion since.
 Indeed, since Hamas did murder children and take others as hostages, should it get credit if it didn't also behead them? It's an appalling thought.
 Some of this scepticism is surely the result of anti-Semitism. But that's not all that's going on.
 One key reason for some incidents of doubt is the suspicion that horrendous, but false or exaggerated, claims are being used as a rationale for war -- and there are many such historical examples, most notably the Iraq war.
 Recently, a former permanent representative of Israel to the United Nations told Britain's Sky News that he was "very puzzled by the constant concern which the world is showing for the Palestinian people". He cited US actions after Sept 11 as a model for what Israel should do in response to Hamas' shocking massacre of civilians on Oct 7, which many have called Israel's Sept 11.
 But if the US response after Sept 11 is a model, it is as a model of what not to do.
 After the attacks, the United States received deep global sympathy. Many Muslims around the world were furious about this blemish upon Islam, even if they opposed US policies: Citizens held vigils, politicians condemned the attacks and clerics repudiated them in mosque sermons. (The idea that Muslims widely celebrated the attacks has been repeatedly shown to be false, or traced back to a few instances of dubious clarity.)
 But, instead of mobilising that widespread global sympathy to try to isolate the extremists, the US chose to wage a reckless and destructive war in Iraq, driven by an impulsive desire for vengeance and justified by falsehoods about weapons of mass destruction.
 The Bush administration's lies in the lead-up to the war, the fiasco of its occupation and the chaos, violence and death that the invasion set off have deeply and indelibly damaged the standing and credibility of the US and its allies.
 People in the region were seared by images of Iraqi institutions -- hospitals, ministries, museums -- being looted while the US military did little; of families shot as they returned home from a hospital or at checkpoints as they missed a hand signal or instructions shouted in English; of the torture and sadism at Abu Ghraib.
 People also saw how occupation policies, like the quick and thoughtless disbanding of the Iraqi Army, contributed to the creation of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) a decade later.
 In the Middle East, the devastating aftermath of that war -- justified by false claims -- has never ended.
 To make matters worse, the Israeli government has a long history of making false claims and denying responsibility for atrocities that later proved to be its doing.
 In one example of many, in 2014, four boys younger than 13 were killed by Israeli air strikes while playing by themselves at a beach -- three of them hit by a second blast while desperately fleeing the initial blast.
 There was first a concerted effort among some pro-Israel social media activists to claim the explosions were due to a Hamas rocket misfiring. The Israeli military initially claimed that "the target of this strike was Hamas terrorist operatives". However, the beach was near a hotel housing journalists for Western outlets, including at least one from The New York Times, who witnessed the killings. The Guardian reported that journalists who visited the area in the aftermath saw no weapons or equipment, and that kids regularly played there.
 Israel then investigated and exonerated itself. Mr Peter Lerner, then a spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces, said that it had targeted a "compound belonging to Hamas' Naval Police and Naval Force (including naval commandos) and which was utilised exclusively by militants".
 But The Telegraph, whose correspondent also witnessed the incident, reported that some of the journalists who had seen the bombing said there had been "no attempt to interview them".
 One can see how this history plays out in the global upheaval over the Hamas claim two weeks ago that an Israeli missile struck a hospital courtyard in Gaza. Israeli and American officials denied this and asserted that the missile came from within Gaza. There were also initial claims that 500 people were killed in the hospital blast, leading to headlines and global condemnations. Then the number was challenged, leading to another round of uproar and back-and-forth.
 It is certainly possible that the hospital may have been accidentally hit by a missile fired in Gaza -- such misfires have happened. But Israel's bombardment has also caused large civilian casualties. The evidence isn't conclusive either way, and the truth remains unknown.
 Yet to a family that lost members in the hospital blast -- which US officials estimate killed hundreds -- that squabble over exact numbers might seem as cruel as the scepticism about the atrocities committed by Hamas to an Israeli family that suffered during the Oct 7 attack.
 But there's still the fact that fabricating or exaggerating atrocities is done to influence the calculus of what the public will accept -- including what costs are justified to impose on civilians. 
 All this highlights the importance of voices capable of retaining trust and consistent concern for all victims.
 I was heartened to see that Human Rights Watch independently verified some of the videos of the horror on Oct 7 and called the attacks deliberate killings. Similarly, Amnesty International's independent investigation led the group to condemn the attacks as "cruel and brutal crimes, including mass summary killings, hostage- taking". Both organisations have called for the attacks to be investigated as war crimes.
 As Amnesty International states, kidnapping civilians is a war crime and the hostages should be released unharmed. And their families shouldn't have to endure this suspicion on top of their pain.
 But to credibly demand that war crimes be stopped and lives respected requires equal concern extended to all victims, including the two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
 The victims are real -- all of them -- and that's where all efforts to rebuild credibility or to seek a solution must begin. NYTIMES

Foreigners in S'pore reminded not to import foreign politics amid Israel-Hamas war

 Foreigners should avoid using Singapore as a platform to further their political causes amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).
 In a Facebook post on Thursday, MOM said: "The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict has claimed the innocent lives of many civilians and evoked emotions globally.
 "Given the heightened tensions, it is important that we remain calm and not let these external events affect the racial and religious harmony and peace in Singapore."
 On Thursday, a joint advisory by MOM, the Internal Security Department and Ministry of Home Affairs also cautioned those working or living in Singapore against supporting or importing foreign politics here. This includes the public display of materials like banners, flags and posters.
 "Singapore has zero tolerance for any acts of extremism, violence or terrorism. Anyone engaging in such acts will be severely dealt with under the Singapore law," the advisory said.
 Foreigners were also reminded to engage in responsible and respectful discussions on the sensitive topic.
 They were reminded to not write, post or share any information in person or online that may stir up emotions that result in violence or cause hatred among different races or religions.
 "Doing so is an offence and punishable under the Singapore law. Offenders may be banned from working in Singapore," the advisory said.
 The notice comes less than a month after Hamas mounted a cross-border attack in southern Israel on Oct 7, igniting a brutal clash between Israel and Hamas that has left thousands dead.
 Israel said Hamas killed 1,400 people and took more than 200 hostages. The Gaza health ministry said some 9,000 Palestinians in the enclave have been killed by Israel's retaliatory strikes.
 In the advisory, foreigners were also reminded to avoid speculating or spreading unverified information on the conflict that may cause discomfort to others.
 Those who wish to make donations to help victims of the war should do so through official channels like the Singapore Red Cross Society or the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation to ensure that donations are used for genuine purposes.
 People who notice any suspicious activities or people who show signs of radicalisation can contact the police on 1800-255-0000 or the Internal Security Department on 1800-2626-473.
 On Oct 27, Singapore supported a United Nations resolution calling for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce. 
 It also requested an immediate and unhindered provision of essential supplies to civilians in Gaza, for Israel to rescind its evacuation orders in the Gaza Strip, and rejected the forced transfer of Palestinians.
 More than 20,000 wounded people are still trapped in the Gaza Strip, despite evacuations of foreign passport holders and badly injured Palestinians, according to humanitarian charity Doctors Without Borders on Thursday.

Muis to issue advisory to guide Muslims on dealing with overseas conflicts

Byline: Zhaki Abdullah, Muis to issue advisory to guide Muslims on dealing with overseas conflicts
Body


 A religious advisory to guide Muslims here on their response to overseas conflicts such as the ongoing one between Israel and Hamas is being developed by the Office of the Mufti, under the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis). 
 The advisory, to be released at a later date, aims to help the community process information related to such conflicts, as well as gain an accurate understanding of the Quran and prophetic traditions, Muis said.
 Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir told reporters that the advisory is meant to help Muslims look at the impact of such conflicts on their religiosity, and how best to manage that impact in a "wise, constructive and positive way". 
 He was speaking on the sidelines of the Religious Leadership Forum 2023: Guiding the Singapore Muslim Community on the Middle East Conflict, held at the Royal Plaza on Scotts hotel on Thursday. 
 Attended by about 120 local asatizah (religious teachers), the forum was organised by Muis, together with the Singapore Islamic Scholars and Religious Teachers Association (Pergas), the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) and the Asatizah Youth Network. 
 The event aimed to provide an understanding of the issues related to the Middle East conflict from the local religious perspective, as well as discuss ways in which religious organisations here can guide the Muslim community in dealing with the issue.
 The conflict began on Oct 7 when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel and killed at least 1,400 people.
 Israel has since declared a "state of war" and launched strikes on the Gaza Strip, killing at least 9,000 so far. 
 On Oct 27, Singapore voted in favour of a United Nations resolution to protect civilians and uphold legal and humanitarian obligations amid the conflict. 
 "It's very important to continue to be with our community to provide the right avenues to help them deal with the impact of the conflict on themselves emotionally as well as spiritually," said Dr Nazirudin. 
 These avenues include encouraging Muslims to pray for peace and resolution to the conflict, as well as participate in humanitarian efforts to help victims. 
 Muslims should also continue to strengthen their relationships to show that peaceful coexistence is possible amid diversity, he said, noting that this is a challenge faced by many societies. 
 RRG co-chairman Mohamed Ali said it is important to validate feelings such as anger and frustration that may arise among both Muslims and non-Muslims amid the current conflict in Gaza. 
 Not addressing such sentiments could lead to extremism, he said, noting that there had been previous instances of self-radicalisation here triggered by the Israel-Palestine conflict. 
 "Moving forward, there is a dire need for our young people not only to understand and comprehend the conflict in its proper perspective, but they also need to be guided in terms of how they can manage their emotions," he said. 
 Pergas' president, Ustaz Muhammad Tarmizi Abdul Wahid, noted that anecdotally, there have been cases of people leaving their jobs in Israel-linked companies as a show of support for the Palestinian cause.
 Doing so without an alternative source of income, though, would mean they neglect their responsibilities to their families, he noted.
 Religious teachers need to be able to address such concerns and guide Muslims here to contribute positively to the humanitarian crisis, he added.

Gaza conflict adds to the divisions in Malaysia

Body


The Palestinian issue has always been an emotive one in Malaysia, and this is hardly surprising for a Muslim-majority country. But the latest bout of violence in Gaza has laid bare the divisions among Muslims, as well as between the races, in an already divided polity. 
 Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim put the issue squarely on the domestic front with a high-profile diplomatic campaign to build an international coalition against Israel. 
 First, Datuk Seri Anwar travelled to Saudi Arabia on Oct 20 to attend the first Asean and Gulf Cooperation Council summit, during which he pleaded with the international community to intervene in Gaza. 
 He then embarked on some shuttle diplomacy, travelling to Egypt and Turkey, where he met President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan respectively. 
 After returning home on Oct 24, Mr Anwar struck a defiant tone when he addressed 16,000 people at a rally at the Axiata Arena in Kuala Lumpur, denouncing Israel's "barbaric acts" in Gaza.
 He added that the situation would be more dire because of "Israel's arrogance that is backed by the United States and Europe". Mr Anwar claimed he was threatened by European Union MPs for his outspoken support for Palestine, and vowed not to be cowed. 
 Critics accused the Prime Minister of grandstanding, saying that he was using the Palestinian issue to shore up support among Malaysian Muslims, since his own Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) is losing their support. 
 Others said he was trying to outshine his one-time nemesis and former premier, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who is well known for his anti-Israel and anti-Jewish comments. 
 The truth probably lies somewhere in between. 
 Mr Anwar has been a long-term supporter of the Palestinian cause since his student activist days, but it is also possible that he is trying to garner support from Muslims and outshine Dr Mahathir on the international stage. 
 But there are far more interesting undercurrents in Malaysia when it comes to the Palestinian issue. 
 Four days after Mr Anwar's rally, the Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) and the Bersatu party organised their own 10,000- strong Palestine Solidarity Rally outside the US Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.
 Many analysts put the contending rallies in context, noting that both the government and the opposition needed Malay-Muslim votes. 
 Malaysian Muslims are divided about what they must do to support the Palestinians. Some think the country should provide lethal aid to Hamas, but others think providing funds and humanitarian aid plus diplomatic pressure is the more effective route. 
 All sides agree though that the Palestine issue can galvanise Malaysian Muslims to create a stronger Islamic identity. 
 In a controversial move, the Education Ministry has tried to stoke pro-Palestinian fervour. On Oct 24, the same day Mr Anwar attended the rally, the ministry issued a circular asking schools to organise a "Palestine Solidarity Week" between Oct 29 and Nov 3. 
 But it looks now like the ministry's move was, at best, a rushed one. 
 Within hours of the circular being issued, pictures began circulating on social media showing primary school children dressed up as "armed" Hamas fighters with toy guns. Teachers were also seen wearing the black-and-white chequered Palestinian keffiyeh. 
 The blowback was immediate. Many non-governmental organisations said schools should not be used to indoctrinate young children in violence, and they would not be able to understand complicated issues such as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Many were only too aware that Hamas used the same tactics with young Palestinian children in the schools in Gaza. 
 Non-Muslims' dilemmaThe issue took on racial overtones when 12 ethnic Chinese MPs from Mr Anwar's own PKR wrote a letter to him asking him to "review" the school programme. 
 PAS immediately warned the 12 MPs to "be careful" lest they were seen to be against the Palestinian struggle, and by extension, against Muslim support for the Palestinian struggle. 
 The reaction towards the MPs encapsulated the dilemma faced by the non-Muslim community in Malaysia, who comprise about 30 per cent of the population. Many feel like they are walking on eggshells when commenting on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 
 In this instance, most of the non-Muslim Malaysians were rightly concerned about the potential for radicalisation among young children. Yet they were also worried they could be seen as supporters of Israel, or worse yet trying to undermine the majority Muslims for their solid support for the Palestinian cause. 
 Even taking the middle ground, such as by saying that both sides committed atrocities, would likely have led to accusations that one was making a false comparison since ordinary Palestinians were fighting an army backed by the US. 
 In such circumstances, silence appears to be the option for many non-Muslims in Malaysia. Yet, silence can also be construed as a lack of sympathy for the Palestinians. 
 In other words, damned if you do and damned if you don't.
 The Palestinian issue has also affected East-West Malaysia. Sarawak announced it was not taking part in the "Palestine Solidarity Week," while senior Sabah politicians in Mr Anwar's own coalition government have spoken out forcefully against the school programme. The churches in Sarawak have also criticised the programme. Sarawak is the only Christian majority state in Malaysia. 
 In the haste to support Palestine, many questions remain unanswered in Malaysia. For example, has Mr Anwar's shuttle diplomacy yielded any concrete results? Why is it that none of the major players, including the Saudis and the Palestinian Authority, has mentioned Malaysia as a possible interlocutor? Will Hamas be given a wider space to operate in Malaysia from now on? 
 Malaysia has been open about its relationship with Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organisation by the US and other Western countries. Its leader Ismail Haniyeh met then Prime Minister Mahathir in Kuala Lumpur in 2020. 
 The media outlets of the Palestine Cultural Organisation Malaysia, a non-governmental organisation in Kuala Lumpur, also closely reflect Hamas views.
 The Palestinian nexus has spilled over into Malaysia in other ways. Malaysia's police chief on Wednesday all but acknowledged that Israel's intelligence agency Mossad was operating in the country. He referred to at least two incidents involving Palestinians, one of whom was assassinated in 2018. 
 Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain said efforts to detect foreign intelligence operatives have been in full swing since the killing of Palestinian Fadi Mohamed al-Batsh, an electrical engineering lecturer and member of Hamas, in a drive-by shooting in Kuala Lumpur in 2018. 
 In the final analysis, what is clear is that as fighting intensifies in Gaza, the Palestinian issue is now at the centre of domestic politics in Malaysia.

S'pore charity RLAF raises $4.6m in two weeks for Gaza victims

A fund-raiser to provide aid for communities in Gaza has raised $4,614,283 as at Wednesday, less than two weeks after it was launched.
 The amount is the highest raised by the Rahmatan Lil Alamin (Blessings to all) Foundation, or RLAF. 
 The total will be even higher after the local charity said in a statement on Friday that the collection period has been extended to Nov 17, as the Commissioner of Charities has granted an extension of permit for the fund raising.
 The fund-raiser had earlier been slated to end on Oct 31.
 The previous record amount the RLAF had collected in a single fund-raiser for humanitarian aid was $2.2 million in March 2023, for victims of the earthquake that struck south-eastern Turkey and northern Syria.
 The ongoing fund-raiser for communities in Gaza was launched on Oct 19 in collaboration with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. 
 The funds raised will be used to provide aid, including in the form of healthcare supplies and shelter, for those affected by the Israel-Hamas war. 
 The latest war in the decades-old conflict began when Hamas fighters broke through the border on Oct 7. Israel says the militants killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 240 hostages in the deadliest day of its 75-year history.
 Israel's ensuing bombardment of the small Palestinian enclave of 2.3 million people has killed at least 9,061 people, according to Gaza health authorities. Some 1.4 million Palestinians have also been displaced from their homes. 
 Members of the public can make donations to RLAF via PayNow (UEN: 200910530ZRLA, indicate "GAZA2023" in remarks) or bank transfer (OCBC Bank: 601313315001), or by mailing a cheque to RLAF or the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore.
 RLAF has organised fund-raising activities in the wake of more than 40 natural disasters around the world. 
 In 2014, it raised nearly $1.2 million for people affected by conflict in Gaza, after a month-long drive.

Malaysians boycott firms with alleged ties to Israel

Body


KUALA LUMPUR Lists of companies with alleged ties to Israel or that had purportedly pledged support to it are circulating on social media here, with Malaysians being urged to boycott them amid the Israel-Hamas war. 
 Among these companies are American food franchises, which are usual targets every time there is renewed conflict in Gaza due to the US government's pro-Israel stance.
 This time, however, some employees are countering the boycott calls, taking to social media to say that these boycotts are affecting their livelihoods. 
 Some Malaysian politicians have also urged caution in the country's response to the conflict, in view of a possible impact on trade ties with the West.
 Malaysia's majority-Muslim population's deep sympathy for the plight of the Palestinians -- coupled with strong words by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim against the bombing of Gaza by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) that has killed thousands -- have fired up those who hope to push for a ceasefire and help the Palestinians from afar. Now entering its fifth week, the conflict has killed more than 1,400 Israelis and over 9,000 Palestinians.
 Malaysians have held big pro-Palestine rallies, with the government designating last week as Palestine Solidarity Week.
 Other Malaysians, including celebrities, have said on social media that they need to do more than just hold protests.
 Well-known Malaysian entrepreneur Vivy Yusof posted a video on Instagram, saying: "If we think we are helpless, guys, we are really not... Keep praying, keep donating, keep speaking up, keep posting, keep boycotting." 
 In the post, which garnered 35,400 likes, she wrote: "I'm not a fan of boycotts, but this time, it's literally a matter of life and death. If we keep funding the global companies that give to IDF, why would they stop -- they will only care if their sales go down." 
 There are different lists floating around on social media, with each showing scores of mainly consumer brands. 
 McDonald's and Burger King are being targeted after their Israeli restaurants gave free meals to IDF personnel, as reported in the media. According to a Reuters report on Oct 17, McDonald's Israel said on its social media accounts that it has given thousands of free meals to the IDF. Newsweek reported on Oct 23 that Burger King in Israel posted photos of the company donating food to Israeli solders.
 McDonald's Malaysia issued statements dissociating itself from the Israeli franchise. It said the company in Malaysia is a 100 per cent Muslim-owned entity, and that it had contributed RM1 million (S$286,000) to the Palestine Humanitarian Fund under the Prime Minister's Department. 
 In an Instagram video, a deaf McDonald's Malaysia worker named Izuan said in sign language: "It is not easy for employers to accept those with disabilities like me. I hope the boycott does not continue."
 On Friday, Malaysian police said they arrested two local men over suspicions of hacking the digital menu screen of a fast-food outlet on Tuesday. Selangor police chief Hussein Omar Khan said the police received a report from the outlet manager saying food products had been changed to show blood, bombs, bullets and the words "Proud Sponsors of Israeli Terrorism".
 Some Malaysians are also boycotting coffee house chain Starbucks. They said the American-based chain sued its labour union in the US state of Iowa over a union social media account stating support for Palestinians, pointing to an Associated Press report dated Oct 19. 
 A barista at a Starbucks outlet in Malaysia who declined to be named said: "Before this boycott, we could get RM30,000 a day (in sales), but now we are lucky to get RM10,000."
 Food and beverage giant Nestle is also one of the names on the list of brands to boycott. According to news reports, it has plants in Israel. 
 Nestle (Malaysia), which produces food products such as Milo, Nescafe, Maggi and KitKat, said on Thursday in an e-mail response to queries from The Sunday Times that its products are made in Malaysia by Malaysians. 
 "As a global company, we foster mutual respect and tolerance across cultures, religions and nationalities. We are deeply saddened by the current humanitarian crisis in Palestine," it said.
 "We firmly oppose all forms of violence and hope that peace will be restored soon."
 Mrs Amanda Sanusi, a 45-year-old Muslim teacher in Kuala Lumpur, said: "I boycott McDonald's, Starbucks, Burger King, any brand that has outright declared it supports Israel. 
 "My children are also boycotting and will update me on any new information on brands that support Israel."
 Responding to reports of the boycott by Malaysians, Palestinian Ambassador to Malaysia Walid Abu Ali told reporters on Friday: "Any measures supporting Palestine and its people are deeply valued. The boycott of Israeli products and franchises supporting Israel serves to minimise the suffering of Palestinians."
 But some have cautioned that the boycott call could have a negative impact on the Malaysian economy, such as a rise in unemployment.
 Sabah Deputy Chief Minister Jeffrey Kitingan warned on Oct 29 that there were signs of division among Malaysians in response to Datuk Seri Anwar's support of the Palestinian cause. 
 Datuk Seri Kitingan said Malaysia may have harmed its reputation and international relations with the West and was in danger of losing trade relations.

Hezbollah leader's speech more bluster than action, but danger of war remains

Byline: Jonathan Eyal Global, Hezbollah leader's speech more bluster than action, but danger of war remains
Body


LONDON The leader of the Middle East's most potent militia has warned that his fighters stand ready to confront the might of the United States military, should the Americans continue to support Israel in the Gaza war. 
 In his first speech since the start of the fighting, Mr Hassan Nasrallah, the cleric who heads the Hezbollah militia based in Lebanon, dismissed the US decision to deploy two aircraft carrier groups closer to the Middle East to deter Hezbollah as irrelevant. 
 "We have prepared well for your fleets, with which you are threatening us. The one who will pay the price will be... your interests, your soldiers and your fleets," he said.
 But significantly, the cleric's much-anticipated speech contained no direct indication that Hezbollah is about to join the fighting against Israel, a move that would undoubtedly unleash a much wider war in the Middle East.
 Established four decades ago as a Shi'ite movement funded and equipped by Iran, Hezbollah claims to have 100,000 fighters, although the actual figure is probably half that, according to Western intelligence assessments.
 But it holds a formidable arsenal of around 130,000 missiles and various projectiles. While many of these are short-range, Hezbollah is increasingly deploying longer-range guided missiles able to hit deep inside Israel, as well as operating drones and anti-ship weapons.
 It is a far more disciplined and well-trained militia than Hamas, the Palestinian organisation that struck Israel on Oct 7, killing over 1,400 Israeli citizens.
 Mr Nasrallah's speech on Friday was seen as a possible turning point in the Middle East crisis, as the leader has the power to open a new front against Israel at any time.
 And Hezbollah intended the speech to be treated as important. Days before, the organisation released on social media Netflix-style video trailers showing the cleric -- revered by some in Lebanon as a demigod -- working hard on the text of his proposed speech.
 Still, it was more about bluster than action.
 Mr Nasrallah praised Hamas for its "great victory" against Israel, an enemy he dismissed as a frail "spider's web" that can be swept away with effective "resistance".
 Yet, the cleric also claimed that Israel's military killed its own citizens to justify the invasion of Gaza, repeating a conspiracy theory now making the rounds among Arabs in the Middle East.
 His speech disappointed those who expected a clear announcement about Hezbollah's plans.
 For, although he warned both Israel and the US not to "provoke" Hezbollah, he claimed that his organisation is already doing enough to harass Israelis by occasionally opening fire on the Jewish state's northern borders with Lebanon.
 "We are distracting large parts of the Israeli army," Mr Nasrallah said. "What is happening on the border may seem modest, but if we look at what is happening on the border objectively, we will find it... very important."
 The speech appears to confirm assessments by Western intelligence agencies that, notwithstanding Mr Nasrallah's threats, Hezbollah has no immediate interest in being sucked into the current war because it knows that it will pay a heavy price in a showdown that is highly likely to involve not only Israel but also the US military.
 More importantly, Iran -- Mr Nasrallah's paymaster -- wants to preserve Hezbollah as a potential military asset for the future, should Israel strike at Iran's nuclear installations, rather than see Hezbollah decimated now.
 Still, the danger that Hezbollah and Israel may stumble by accident into a war remains high.
 So far, Hezbollah has stuck to its long-established strategy of firing primarily at military targets in northern Israel, within an approximately 1.6km radius from the border.
 Civilians are unlikely to be hurt in such attacks since Israel evacuated 42 towns and villages in the north, so this limits the nature of a potential Israeli response.
 But if the fighting in Gaza intensifies, and particularly if Hamas in Gaza appears to be facing defeat, pressure will mount on Hezbollah to escalate its border skirmishes with Israel by striking deeper inside the country.
 And even one errant Hezbollah missile hitting an Israeli civilian target could trigger a heavy Israeli response. That is how Hezbollah and Israel stumbled into a month-long war in 2006, a confrontation neither side anticipated.
 Fearing a miscalculation of this sort is why US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who visited Israel on Friday just as Mr Nasrallah spoke, repeated the warning that Washington had "been very clear from the outset that we are determined that there not be a second or third front" in the current Gaza war. 
 "And we've backed up those words with practical deeds," Mr Blinken added.
 Meanwhile, Rear-Admiral Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for Israel's armed forces, said that Israeli troops remained on "very high alert" along Israel's northern border.
 So, although Mr Nasrallah's speech does not herald another war front at the moment, the overall impression throughout the Middle East is that a bloody Hezbollah-Israeli confrontation is being merely postponed rather than averted.

Indonesians stage peaceful rally in Jakarta in support of Palestine

JAKARTA  Tens of thousands of people were at the National Monument on Sunday to express solidarity with the Palestinians amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, the largest public gathering in Indonesia since the Israel-Hamas war broke out.
 Dressed in white robes and wearing black-and-white Palestinian scarves, they waved Palestine flags and chanted "God is great" and "Free Palestine" as they demanded Israeli forces end their deadly siege of Gaza. 
 As footage of bombings in Gaza flashed across a screen, Muslim figures took turns to deliver speeches on a stage at the National Monument (Monas) square, calling for, among other things, a boycott of Israeli goods and an investigation of Israeli hostilities in Gaza at the international court. 
 "Israeli oppressors, fight, fight, fight" and "Indonesia defends Palestine", the protesters shouted.
 The peaceful rally was led by the Indonesian Ulema Council, the country's highest Islamic authority. It was supported by the government, as well as Muslim groups and those of other faiths, including Buddhism and Christianity. 
 Several ministers and politicians, including Religious Affairs Minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas, Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, former Jakarta governor and presidential candidate Anies Baswedan and House of Representatives chair Puan Maharani, were present.
 Despite the heavy downpour on Saturday night, many protesters arrived from various cities in Java via buses and motorcycles. 
 Some spent the night at the Istiqlal Mosque, the largest mosque in South-east Asia, and performed their morning prayers before making their way to Monas at 7am (Singapore time). 
 Others like Ms Evi Murniyati, 55, and her three friends from Bogor city, outside Jakarta, left their homes when dawn broke. 
 Ms Evi told The Straits Times that she wished she could fly to Palestine to cook and care for the orphaned children. 
 She added: "As a mother and woman, my heart shattered into a million pieces when I saw the children who lost their homes, parents, and even their lives. Why them? They are innocent."
 Ms Sumayah, a 26-year-old content creator whose name has only one word, made banners and persuaded her parents to join her at the event.
 Visibly distraught, she said: "I cannot imagine how life would be if I were a Gaza resident there, every hour, minute and second, thinking when I will die."
 Sunday's rally was the latest in a series of recent peaceful protests, including at the United States Embassy and United Nations mission, only a short walk from Monas.
 Indonesia is a strong supporter of the Palestinians and such rallies are not uncommon in the world's most populous Muslim-majority country of 280 million people.
 In March, members of some Muslim groups took to the streets in Jakarta to protest against the Israeli football team's participation in the Fifa U-20 World Cup. The world football governing body stripped Indonesia's hosting rights following the surge of resistance. 
 An Oct 7 incursion by Hamas fighters, who killed about 1,400 people in Israel, has provoked a retaliation on the militant group. Since then, thousands of Palestinians have been killed in heavy air strikes on the Gaza Strip. 
 The situation in Gaza remains desperate, with food, fuel and medicine  running short, according to reports citing aid groups.
 Indonesian President Joko Widodo has repeatedly condemned the hostilities and called for a ceasefire. He also said Indonesia will continue to communicate with various parties to resolve the issue and send humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people.
 In a broadcast last Monday, he said: "Indonesia is enraged about the worsening situation in Gaza, especially the humanitarian situation. We continue to closely follow developments in Gaza and Indonesia's position is very clear and firm, strongly condemning random attacks on civilians and civilian facilities in Gaza."
 Last Tuesday, Indonesia's anti-terror police warned the public against taking part in pro-Palestinian protests and fund-raising activities being staged by several terror groups. 
 Security analysts have said the bombardment of Gaza could drive recruitment for Muslim militant groups, though there is little evidence of that at this point.
 Protesters told ST that humanity has no religion and their anger was directed at Israeli forces, and not people of other faiths. They also called for Western countries, such as the US, to end their support of the Israeli military.

PAP's integrity and honesty must never be compromised, says PM Lee

 The ruling People's Action Party's (PAP) commitment to honesty and incorruptibility is "absolutely non-negotiable", Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Sunday, as he stressed the need for high standards of integrity and competent governance. 
 "Singapore is a small place. Our system works," he told more than 1,000 PAP members at the party's biennial convention at the Singapore Expo Convention and Exhibition Centre.
 "If you do something improper, sooner or later, it will come to light. And when it does, you will be investigated. And if it is proved that you did something wrong, you are out and consequences will follow."
 PM Lee, the PAP's secretary-general, said this principle applies not just to ministers or party leaders, but also to every party member, and he cautioned those in attendance against abusing their positions or accepting any favours.
 "It's shameful. It's wrong.
 "Remember, you are a member of the People's Action Party, and the name of the party says it all -- your duty is to serve the people, to act on behalf of the people and never of yourself," he added.
 "Our integrity and honesty must never be compromised, and only in that way can we do justice and uphold the trust that Singaporeans have given us," PM Lee said.
 He pointed to a Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau investigation into a minister -- a veiled reference to the ongoing probe into Transport Minister S. Iswaran, who has been put on leave of absence.
 "However strict our discipline, however zealous our enforcement -- human nature being what it is -- somewhere, sometime, someone will be tempted and will go astray."
 The Prime Minister added: "It is particularly when we are tested that we must prove our mettle, put our principles into action, regardless of the embarrassment or political cost." 
 PM Lee also referred to the sprawling $2.8 billion money laundering case in which nine men and a woman were arrested and charged.
 He said a journalist had asked him whether by promoting family offices -- investment funds managing the assets of wealthy families -- and the financial industry, Singapore is letting its standards slip to attract "unclean money".
 "My answer was: Not on your life," PM Lee said.
 "We will never let our standards slip. It's not worth it. If we let it happen, if we relax and close one eye and let dirty money in, what will happen to us? The doubtful characters will come, they will spend generously to make themselves appear respectable, to show that they love Singapore, to ingratiate themselves to us, to try to get PR (permanent residency) and citizenship.
 "They will cultivate ministers and officials, they will donate to good causes, they will make themselves useful in all sorts of ways... Very soon, our whole system would be tainted, and then corrupted."
 Noting how law enforcement agencies here picked up warning signs in 2021 and watched the money laundering network carefully before swooping in to cripple it, PM Lee said everybody who does business in Singapore must know how things work here.
 "We will never let this system go corrupt," he said.
 Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who will take over the top job before the next general election, said he, too, believes in keeping politics here clean, honest and right.
 Besides integrity, another basic prerequisite for the PAP is clear and strong governance, said PM Lee. He said the party is elected not just to occupy office or be popular, or to seek power for the sake of it.
 "We fight to form the Government, so that we can serve Singaporeans."
 He said the Government has to be clear on what needs to be done and act decisively and promptly.
 "We must be prepared to take the hard decisions, and have the courage to do the right thing for Singapore, even if this incurs short-term political costs. And if we are not ready or able to do that, we should get out of the way," he said.
 PM Lee cited examples of how the party had pushed through difficult decisions despite initial doubts and resistance -- from national service to resettling people into public housing.
 He said the PAP government has continued doing its best in this regard, including how it contained the Covid-19 pandemic.
 Beyond Singapore's borders, PM Lee said the Government has continued strengthening ties with the United States and China amid increasing geopolitical rivalry, settled longstanding issues including those related to airspace and defence with Indonesia, and is discussing key bilateral issues with Malaysia.
 Singapore is also watching closely events in the Middle East, and the recent re-eruption of conflict between Israel and Palestine has had an impact here, he added. 
 "Like people elsewhere in the world, Singaporeans identify with the plight of the Palestinian people, and Muslim Singaporeans especially have felt this very strongly," he said.
 "But all Singaporeans are appalled by the human suffering in Gaza as Israel attacks targets there, as they were by Hamas' terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians on Oct 7 that prompted these IDF (Israel Defence Forces) military operations." 
 PM Lee added: "The Government has to take a national position that upholds our consistent principles, which considers the sentiments and feelings of our population.
 "We feel sympathy for the civilian victims on both sides and will extend humanitarian help to those in need. But we must not let problems elsewhere widen fault lines in our society." 
 To prepare for the future, PM Lee said the Government has made longer-term decisions.
 For example, the increase in the goods and services tax -- which will climb from 8 per cent to 9 per cent from 2024 -- is a difficult but unavoidable move to fund the rising healthcare needs of an ageing population. 
 He said policy changes have also been made on sensitive social issues, such as the repealing of Section 377A, which criminalised sex between men.
 PM Lee added: "Tackling a global pandemic, solving immediate problems and planning for the future, all at the same time -- this is what people expect of a competent and efficient government."

Singapore's position and principles on the Israeli-Palestinian situation

Byline: , Singapore's position and principles on the Israeli-Palestinian situation
Body


 Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Monday set out the Government's position on the Israel-Hamas conflict, going into the seven principles underpinning the position.
 1   
 Singapore must always take a zero-tolerance approach towards terrorism, regardless of where and when the act is perpetrated and by whom, said Dr Balakrishnan. This is because terrorism is a "clear and present danger and a threat for Singapore and Singaporeans", he added.
 2   
 This is enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, and is particularly important for Singapore, said Dr Balakrishnan. He added: "Have no doubt, if Singapore is ever attacked, we would certainly assert and exercise the right of self-defence."
 3 
 If military action is taken in exercising the right of self-defence, countries must abide by the principles of necessity and proportionality, and must also comply with the laws of war, including the principle of distinction and humanity enshrined in the Geneva Conventions, said Dr Balakrishnan. 
 They include ensuring minimum destruction to civilian life and infrastructure, among other things. He added that Singapore will support the investigation of all allegations after the war, in accordance with international law, urging all parties to cooperate in these investigations.
 4   
 Dr Balakrishnan called on all parties to enable this, particularly Israel and Egypt, which have borders with Gaza. He added that he had spoken to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Sunday and the United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister, Sheikh Abdullah Zayed, the day before to express Singapore's support for humanitarian efforts. 
 These include the Egyptian government's efforts to open the Rafah crossing to facilitate the flow of humanitarian goods into Gaza, and the UAE's plans to perhaps evacuate injured children and their families. 
 5 
 Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore's longstanding support for such a two-state solution, consistent with relevant UN Security Council resolutions -- in which Israel must accept a Palestinian state, just as Palestinians must accept Israel's right to exist -- has not changed. He added that Singapore has good relations with Israel and also with the Palestinian people and the Palestinian Authority. 
 "Our ability to speak truth to friends and to be friends to both sides, even while they are locked in mortal conflict, is a privileged position, but one that can only be maintained if we are consistent and we operate on the basis of principles," he said. 
 6  
 Painful as it is to witness the conflict, Singaporeans must not allow external events to divide the country, said Dr Balakrishnan. He stressed that the conflict is not about religion, but about territory, self-determination and identity, complicated by domestic politics on both sides. 
 He noted that Singapore's Muslim community has responded in a very "restrained, responsible and responsive manner", working with other communities to raise funds for humanitarian aid, and that Singapore Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir and Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abergel had written to each other of their own accord to express solidarity and support for each other. 
   7  
 Following Hamas' attacks on Oct 7, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) had advised Singaporeans to leave Israel and the Palestinian Territories as soon as possible and had facilitated the departure of those who needed assistance. More than 120 Singaporeans left, but 44 Singaporeans decided to stay behind, and MFA has remained in contact with them, said Dr Balakrishnan.

About 40 Singaporeans remain in Israel and Palestinian Territories

 About 40 Singaporeans remain in Israel and the Palestinian Territories amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the region.
 Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan told Parliament on Monday that his ministry continues to be in contact with the Singaporeans who have chosen to remain.
 More than 120 Singaporeans had earlier left by land or air, he said.
 "While most Singaporeans left Israel via commercial means, a few who were unable to do so departed via dedicated evacuation flights which were organised by other countries," said Dr Balakrishnan, reiterating Singapore's gratitude to the governments of Australia, Canada, Portugal and South Korea for helping these Singaporeans to leave Israel safely.
 On Oct 14, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) confirmed that five Singaporeans were among 220 passengers on board a South Korean military transport plane that evacuated civilians from Tel Aviv, taking them to Seoul.
 MFA had on Oct 10 advised Singaporeans living in Israel and the Palestinian Territories to leave as soon as possible through commercial options.
 The ministry had previously advised Singaporeans to avoid all travel to the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Israel's borders with the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria.
 Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman told Parliament in Malay that Singaporeans had stepped forward to contribute generously to the humanitarian relief efforts in various ways.
 As an example, he cited the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation's (RLAF) fund-raising appeal, which will be directed to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. 
 The fund has raised more than $4.6 million, while the Singapore Red Cross' fund-raising campaign has also raised more than $350,000 from the public. 
 "The generous donations received thus far have been heartening, but more importantly, we see Singaporeans' strong spirit of solidarity," Dr Maliki said, noting that many different community and interfaith groups came together to contribute to RLAF's humanitarian aid for Gaza.
 Dr Balakrishnan said he spoke to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Sunday, telling him that Singapore understands the tremendous strain that Egypt, as an immediate neighbour, faces. He added that Singapore wants to support Egypt.
 "I commended the Egyptian government's efforts to open the Rafah crossing to facilitate the flow of humanitarian goods into Gaza and equally, the possible evacuation of seriously injured persons for medical treatment," said Dr Balakrishan.
 Dr Maliki also said he will leave for Cairo, Egypt, on Monday night.
 He told Parliament that he will oversee the aid that Singapore is sending, as well as RLAF's contribution to Gaza. 
 He will also be briefed by various agencies about the situation in Gaza, and discuss with Egyptian leaders how Singapore can help the victims.
 Dr Maliki said Singapore has engaged the Palestinian Authority leadership at the highest level, and since early 2022, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, Dr Balakrishnan and he had visited Ramallah in the central West Bank. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also visited Ramallah in 2016 and hosted Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh in Singapore in October 2022.
 Dr Maliki also noted that Singapore has and will continue to support the Palestinian Authority's capacity-building efforts through the $10 million Enhanced Technical Assistance Package.
 In a separate statement on Monday, MFA said Dr Maliki will make a working visit to Algiers, Algeria, from Tuesday to Wednesday, and Cairo from Thursday to Saturday. The visit will reaffirm Singapore's warm and longstanding ties with both countries, said MFA.
 In Algeria, Dr Maliki will commemorate the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Singapore and Algeria, and meet the country's leaders and businessmen.
 In Egypt, he will meet Egyptian leaders and representatives from the Singapore business community there. Dr Maliki will also visit the Suez Canal Economic Zone and engage with Singaporean students and young Egyptian leaders.

Gaza conflict: The vital next steps to a new vision of the Middle East

Body


It is now exactly one month since fighters belonging to Hamas broke through the supposedly impenetrable border between Gaza and Israel and proceeded to murder an estimated 1,400 Israelis. In response, Israel launched a ferocious military offensive to root out Hamas in Gaza, which continues to unfold. 
 The violence and carnage -- the Palestinian death toll is rapidly approaching 10,000 -- won't stop any time soon. Yet, notwithstanding the current gloom, the United States and its Western allies in the Middle East are engaged in a frenzy of diplomatic activity designed not only to reduce the current bloodshed, but also to lay the foundations for a possible future dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians.
 At this moment, all this talk about diplomatic dialogue can sound far-fetched, especially in a place where optimists are invariably proved wrong. The Middle East, as former Israeli foreign minister Abba Eban once lamented, is a region where people "never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity".
 Turning pointYet, one conclusion is already evident: The shocking Hamas assault on Israel represents a decisive turning point for the region. From now on, no future Israeli government would be able to claim convincingly that the Palestinian problem can be "managed" or wished away. Arab governments would be called upon to take greater responsibility for their region's security arrangement. And the US is faced yet again with the fact that it remains the Middle East's indispensable superpower.
 But first, let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the US, coupled with broader pressure from the international community, succeeds in forcing Israel to stop fighting right now. What would be the outcome'
 Hamas would not only be able to claim victory, but would also bask in the claim of being the most successful anti-Israeli organisation ever. Far from encouraging moderation in the Middle East, if Hamas still stands as Gaza's ruler at the end of this conflict, the outcome will be a more radicalised and extremist Middle East.
 A humiliated Israel would also be less interested in any deal with the Palestinians. It is one of the tragedies of the present situation that many of those Israeli civilians Hamas killed on Oct 7 were precisely those young secular Israelis and kibbutz dwellers who tended to vote for moderate politicians. A war that ends with a Hamas victory would encourage all the worst politicians in Israel, all those who view Palestinians as "racially inferior" and claim that the Jewish state should rely only on its might. 
 None of this is to suggest that Gaza should be condemned to months of continued butchery. Foreign governments are right to insist that Israel opens humanitarian corridors to allow for the supply of food and medicines.
 And, of course, Israel can never achieve its stated objective of eliminating Hamas. But what it may be able to achieve is to dismantle Hamas' structures and destroy the organisation's infrastructure comprehensively enough so that Hamas won't be able to make a convincing argument that it has won this confrontation. This was done before in the Middle East. Jordan succeeded in forcefully expelling the Palestine Liberation Organisation in 1970. As inconvenient as the argument may be, the fact remains that only if Hamas emerges fundamentally degraded from this conflict would there be any hope for regional calm.
 This means that while reducing the number of civilian casualties and alleviating human suffering should remain key objectives, an equally important task for diplomats is to ponder the political arrangements that can be put on the ground in Gaza once the fighting stops, a move that is necessary to lay the foundation for future political accommodation.
 Over half of Gaza's population is now internally displaced; the grandchildren of refugees from the creation of the Jewish state back in 1948 are now again refugees. Much of Gaza's housing and infrastructure is destroyed. A fundamental economic reconstruction programme is essential, but this is feasible only if there is an alternative to Hamas' return to power.
 International peacekeeping forceThe best approach would be to create an international peacekeeping force able to take over from withdrawing Israeli troops; the sooner such a force can be cobbled together, the easier it will be to persuade the Israelis to stop. 
 The model is well tested: It was applied to conflicts in the Balkans during the 1990s and the fraught period leading to Timor-Leste's independence from Indonesia in 2002.
 To be sure, the obstacles to the creation of such a peacekeeping force remain considerable. It will be difficult to persuade Russia and China to vote a mandate for such a force in the United Nations Security Council unless the Americans, who are brokering such discussions, are prepared to get the Russians and Chinese more involved, which they are not.
 Given current sentiments in the Middle East, such a peacekeeping force cannot be composed of Western militaries; it will have to rely on contributions from Arab and other Muslim nations. 
 But none of the Middle East's armed forces have much experience in mounting peacekeeping operations, and other more experienced Muslim military contributors -- such as, say, Indonesia or Malaysia -- are hardly likely even to consider such a hazardous Gaza peacekeeping mission unless it is tied to a broader political process to address the plight of the Palestinians.
 And it's here that the genuinely complex diplomatic task begins, for there are, at the moment, two competing views on the future of the Middle East. 
 The first is promoted by the US and envisages the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the moderate Palestinian Authority, which currently rules the West Bank. The second is the Middle East, promoted by Iran as the so-called Axis of Resistance leader. This informal anti-Western alliance includes Syria as well as a variety of Iranian Shi'ite proxies.
 Despite the grim situation, the US-led vision for the region stands a better chance. The current Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants no discussion with any Palestinian. But Mr Netanyahu's catastrophic handling of the crisis will almost certainly end his political career. New elections in Israel are virtually inevitable, perhaps as early as the middle of 2024. All opinion polls indicate that Mr Netanyahu and his far-right allies will be crushed.
 Any government following that of Mr Netanyahu will be interested in reopening talks with the Palestinian Authority. True, the Authority does not have much credibility and desperately needs reform. And, yes, no new Israeli government will contemplate any major concessions before the results of the US presidential elections are known in November 2024. 
 Still, most Israeli politicians who are likely to take power now accept that whether they like it or not, their country cannot be safe without an eventual settlement of the Palestinian question.
 The Iran threatHowever, talks between Israel and the Palestinians will bear fruit only if, while pushing both sides into negotiations, the US is also firm in rebuffing Iran's vision of the Axis of Resistance.
 Until now, the Biden administration's policy towards Iran was based on a conviction that the Islamic Republic could be persuaded to accept pragmatic compromises that served its interests. But the history of the Iranian regime since it came to power in 1979 indicates that escalation is the country's weapon of choice. Whenever they feel weak domestically, Iran's rulers escalate their overseas defiance. And so, it is now: Iran is determined to upend the regional order by any means.
 Thus, Washington's ability to push Israel into any meaningful negotiations about the creation of an independent Palestinian state depends to a large extent on America's willingness to rebuff -- even by force, if necessary -- Iran's regional designs. And that may well mean that, paradoxically, while Israeli-Palestinian tensions could subside in 2024, US-Iran pressures will need to increase. Either way, more US involvement is required in the short term if Washington wants to divest itself of Middle East quagmires in the future.
 Needless to say, many of these diplomatic scenarios are based on assumptions of what regional actors should do rather than what they are likely to do. And nobody should underestimate the severe difficulties of any diplomacy in the Middle East. 
 As the old grim joke goes, "in the Middle East, things will get much worse before they get much worse".
 Still, the US has played a dramatic role in the current Gaza war, gaining real leverage with Israel. While many people in the region distrust the US, no other international actor has such a decisive influence and the wherewithal to accomplish its objectives.
 And despite all the complications, a deal's contours are pretty simple. As Dr Ziad Asali, founder of the American Task Force on Palestine and himself a Palestinian, movingly remarked recently, "ultimately, though -- no matter what happens in Gaza -- two peoples will still have to share the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. The Israelis aren't leaving, and neither are the Palestinians".

About 40 Singaporeans remain in Israel and Palestinian Territories

 About 40 Singaporeans remain in Israel and the Palestinian Territories amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the region.
 Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan told Parliament on Monday that his ministry continues to be in contact with the Singaporeans who have chosen to remain.
 More than 120 Singaporeans had earlier left by land or air, he said.
 "While most Singaporeans left Israel via commercial means, a few who were unable to do so departed via dedicated evacuation flights which were organised by other countries," said Dr Balakrishnan, reiterating Singapore's gratitude to the governments of Australia, Canada, Portugal and South Korea for helping these Singaporeans to leave Israel safely.
 On Oct 14, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) confirmed that five Singaporeans were among 220 passengers on board a South Korean military transport plane that evacuated civilians from Tel Aviv, taking them to Seoul.
 MFA had on Oct 10 advised Singaporeans living in Israel and the Palestinian Territories to leave as soon as possible through commercial options.
 The ministry had previously advised Singaporeans to avoid all travel to the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Israel's borders with the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria.
 Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman told Parliament in Malay that Singaporeans had stepped forward to contribute generously to the humanitarian relief efforts in various ways.
 As an example, he cited the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation's (RLAF) fund-raising appeal, which will be directed to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. 
 The fund has raised more than $4.6 million, while the Singapore Red Cross' fund-raising campaign has also raised more than $350,000 from the public. 
 "The generous donations received thus far have been heartening, but more importantly, we see Singaporeans' strong spirit of solidarity," Dr Maliki said, noting that many different community and interfaith groups came together to contribute to RLAF's humanitarian aid for Gaza.
 Dr Balakrishnan said he spoke to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Sunday, telling him that Singapore understands the tremendous strain that Egypt, as an immediate neighbour, faces. He added that Singapore wants to support Egypt.
 "I commended the Egyptian government's efforts to open the Rafah crossing to facilitate the flow of humanitarian goods into Gaza and equally, the possible evacuation of seriously injured persons for medical treatment," said Dr Balakrishan.
 Dr Maliki also said he will leave for Cairo, Egypt, on Monday night.
 He told Parliament that he will oversee the aid that Singapore is sending, as well as RLAF's contribution to Gaza. 
 He will also be briefed by various agencies about the situation in Gaza, and discuss with Egyptian leaders how Singapore can help the victims.
 Dr Maliki said Singapore has engaged the Palestinian Authority leadership at the highest level, and since early 2022, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, Dr Balakrishnan and he had visited Ramallah in the central West Bank. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also visited Ramallah in 2016 and hosted Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh in Singapore in October 2022.
 Dr Maliki also noted that Singapore has and will continue to support the Palestinian Authority's capacity-building efforts through the $10 million Enhanced Technical Assistance Package.
 In a separate statement on Monday, MFA said Dr Maliki will make a working visit to Algiers, Algeria, from Tuesday to Wednesday, and Cairo from Thursday to Saturday. The visit will reaffirm Singapore's warm and longstanding ties with both countries, said MFA.
 In Algeria, Dr Maliki will commemorate the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Singapore and Algeria, and meet the country's leaders and businessmen.

Workers' Party clarifies position, condemns Hamas' acts of terror

Byline: Tham Yuen-C Senior, Workers' Party clarifies position, condemns Hamas' acts of terror
Body


 Several ministers on Monday pressed Workers' Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh to clarify his position on Hamas' attack on Israel, taking issue with the party's earlier statement, which described the attack as a "military operation" instead of a "terrorist act". 
 They said Mr Singh, who is Leader of the Opposition, and his fellow Aljunied GRC MP Gerald Giam had not described the Oct 7 attack as an "act of terror", though they had acknowledged the attacks should be condemned.
 But Mr Singh said his party's position had been clearly stated in the speeches, adding that Singapore has not designated Hamas as a terrorist group.
 He also said his party had wanted to take a "more balanced approach" in its Oct 18 statement, as it felt both Hamas' and Israel's actions deserved condemnation, though for different reasons. 
 The issue sparked a back and forth between Mr Singh on one side, and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on the other, during the debate in Parliament on the Israel-Hamas conflict.
 The WP's statement left room for "ambiguity", which is dangerous because Singapore's national security is at stake, DPM Wong said. 
 In its Oct 18 statement, the WP called on Israel to reject the collective punishment of innocent civilians, and also called for the "immediate return of all Israeli hostages captured in Hamas' military operation in southern Israel" on Oct 7.
 During the debate, Dr Balakrishnan said the acts of indiscriminate killing, torture and kidnapping were "acts of terrorism".
 "It was not a military operation targeted at military targets, and such acts cannot be justified by any rationale, any historical grievance, any religious belief, any context," he said, adding that Singapore had to take a "clear and unambiguous stand" against terrorism.
 DPM Wong echoed the same sentiment, saying: "Let's be clear: It is in our national interest to do so. To compromise on this stand would be to compromise our own security."
 Responding to the ministers, Mr Singh said the WP wanted to emphasise that the killing of non-combatants by any country or organisation deserves "no less than absolute condemnation".
 Describing it as a "very even-keeled approach", he added: "On the one hand, the terrorist attacks are not to be condoned. On the other hand, when you have matters such as Israeli settlers evicting Palestinians from their homes in the West Bank, even today... that also has to be condemned."
 He asked the Government how it would characterise what Israel had done in the occupied Palestinian Territories.
 Moreover, said Mr Singh, the inter-ministry committee on terrorist designation, which is responsible for the designation of terrorists, had not designated Hamas as a terrorist group.
 Dr Balakrishnan said in response that what he asked the WP to clarify is Hamas' attacks on Oct 7. Whether or not Hamas is on the list of designated terror groups did not preclude these attacks from being called out, he added.
 The minister also said that Singapore has consistently supported a two-state solution and spoken out against Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territories.
 After several exchanges on the issue, both DPM Wong and Dr Balakrishnan said they were glad that Mr Singh had explained the WP's stance clearly, and noted that both the WP chief and Mr Giam had condemned Hamas' acts as acts of terrorism.
 DPM Wong said that without the benefit of Mr Singh's explanation in the House, there had been ambiguity about the WP statement, and questions about the party's stance on the issue.
 "Some might even ask whether the WP had deliberately overlooked this just to appear more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause," he said.
 To this, Mr Singh said that though the Government deems that there were "some omissions which were quite critical" in the WP statement, no one had contacted him on Oct 18 to tell him that it was problematic from a national security angle.
 He added: "But I would like to assure the Foreign Minister and, of course, the Government as well as DPM, that in future if the Government has an inkling of such a concern that there are national security matters or issues which the opposition may not be apprised of, or we may have completely ignored, let us know.
 "And my assurance to the DPM himself is we will certainly take those views on board very carefully. Because as the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned, at the end of the day, we want a Singapore where we have a united population even though we know that the issue tugs at the heartstrings of people on both sides."
 DPM Wong then asked Mr Singh if the WP would update its statement posted on its social media pages, to which Mr Singh replied that he would append his and Mr Giam's speeches to the posts.
 Wrapping up, DPM Wong said: "This is not just nitpicking at words. It is a key point of principle because national security is at stake. And so, indeed, in situations like this, we must stand united, politics must stop at the water's edge. 
 "And that means on external matters where national security is at stake, political parties should not try to outflank the Government just to score political points. Let's not risk our precious unity for short-term political gain, not when our collective security and fundamental interests are at stake. All of us owe this basic duty to Singaporeans."

Singapore's position and principles on the Israeli-Palestinian situation

Body


 Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Monday set out the Government's position on the Israel-Hamas conflict, going into the seven principles underpinning the position.
 1   
 Singapore must always take a zero-tolerance approach towards terrorism, regardless of where and when the act is perpetrated and by whom, said Dr Balakrishnan. This is because terrorism is a "clear and present danger and a threat for Singapore and Singaporeans", he added.
 2   
 This is enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, and is particularly important for Singapore, said Dr Balakrishnan. He added: "Have no doubt, if Singapore is ever attacked, we would certainly assert and exercise the right of self-defence."
 3 
 If military action is taken in exercising the right of self-defence, countries must abide by the principles of necessity and proportionality, and must also comply with the laws of war, including the principle of distinction and humanity enshrined in the Geneva Conventions, said Dr Balakrishnan. 
 They include ensuring minimum destruction to civilian life and infrastructure, among other things. He added that Singapore will support the investigation of all allegations after the war, in accordance with international law, urging all parties to cooperate in these investigations.
 4   
 Dr Balakrishnan called on all parties to enable this, particularly Israel and Egypt, which have borders with Gaza. He added that he had spoken to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Sunday and the United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister, Sheikh Abdullah Zayed, the day before to express Singapore's support for humanitarian efforts. 
 These include the Egyptian government's efforts to open the Rafah crossing to facilitate the flow of humanitarian goods into Gaza, and the UAE's plans to perhaps evacuate injured children and their families. 
 5 
 Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore's longstanding support for such a two-state solution, consistent with relevant UN Security Council resolutions -- in which Israel must accept a Palestinian state, just as Palestinians must accept Israel's right to exist -- has not changed. He added that Singapore has good relations with Israel and also with the Palestinian people and the Palestinian Authority. 
 "Our ability to speak truth to friends and to be friends to both sides, even while they are locked in mortal conflict, is a privileged position, but one that can only be maintained if we are consistent and we operate on the basis of principles," he said. 
 6  
 Painful as it is to witness the conflict, Singaporeans must not allow external events to divide the country, said Dr Balakrishnan. He stressed that the conflict is not about religion, but about territory, self-determination and identity, complicated by domestic politics on both sides. 
 He noted that Singapore's Muslim community has responded in a very "restrained, responsible and responsive manner", working with other communities to raise funds for humanitarian aid, and that Singapore Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir and Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abergel had written to each other of their own accord to express solidarity and support for each other. 
   7  
 Following Hamas' attacks on Oct 7, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) had advised Singaporeans to leave Israel and the Palestinian Territories as soon as possible and had facilitated the departure of those who needed assistance. More than 120 Singaporeans left, but 44 Singaporeans decided to stay behind, and MFA has remained in contact with them, said Dr Balakrishnan.

 Over half of Gaza's population is now internally displaced; the grandchildren of refugees from the creation of the Jewish state back in 1948 are now again refugees. Much of Gaza's housing and infrastructure is destroyed. A fundamental economic reconstruction programme is essential, but this is feasible only if there is an alternative to Hamas' return to power.
 International peacekeeping forceThe best approach would be to create an international peacekeeping force able to take over from withdrawing Israeli troops; the sooner such a force can be cobbled together, the easier it will be to persuade the Israelis to stop. 
 The model is well tested: It was applied to conflicts in the Balkans during the 1990s and the fraught period leading to Timor-Leste's independence from Indonesia in 2002.
 To be sure, the obstacles to the creation of such a peacekeeping force remain considerable. It will be difficult to persuade Russia and China to vote a mandate for such a force in the United Nations Security Council unless the Americans, who are brokering such discussions, are prepared to get the Russians and Chinese more involved, which they are not.
 Given current sentiments in the Middle East, such a peacekeeping force cannot be composed of Western militaries; it will have to rely on contributions from Arab and other Muslim nations. 
 But none of the Middle East's armed forces have much experience in mounting peacekeeping operations, and other more experienced Muslim military contributors -- such as, say, Indonesia or Malaysia -- are hardly likely even to consider such a hazardous Gaza peacekeeping mission unless it is tied to a broader political process to address the plight of the Palestinians.
 And it's here that the genuinely complex diplomatic task begins, for there are, at the moment, two competing views on the future of the Middle East. 
 The first is promoted by the US and envisages the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the moderate Palestinian Authority, which currently rules the West Bank. The second is the Middle East, promoted by Iran as the so-called Axis of Resistance leader. This informal anti-Western alliance includes Syria as well as a variety of Iranian Shi'ite proxies.
 Despite the grim situation, the US-led vision for the region stands a better chance. The current Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants no discussion with any Palestinian. But Mr Netanyahu's catastrophic handling of the crisis will almost certainly end his political career. New elections in Israel are virtually inevitable, perhaps as early as the middle of 2024. All opinion polls indicate that Mr Netanyahu and his far-right allies will be crushed.
 Any government following that of Mr Netanyahu will be interested in reopening talks with the Palestinian Authority. True, the Authority does not have much credibility and desperately needs reform. And, yes, no new Israeli government will contemplate any major concessions before the results of the US presidential elections are known in November 2024. 
 Still, most Israeli politicians who are likely to take power now accept that whether they like it or not, their country cannot be safe without an eventual settlement of the Palestinian question.
 The Iran threatHowever, talks between Israel and the Palestinians will bear fruit only if, while pushing both sides into negotiations, the US is also firm in rebuffing Iran's vision of the Axis of Resistance.
 Until now, the Biden administration's policy towards Iran was based on a conviction that the Islamic Republic could be persuaded to accept pragmatic compromises that served its interests. But the history of the Iranian regime since it came to power in 1979 indicates that escalation is the country's weapon of choice. Whenever they feel weak domestically, Iran's rulers escalate their overseas defiance. And so, it is now: Iran is determined to upend the regional order by any means.
 Thus, Washington's ability to push Israel into any meaningful negotiations about the creation of an independent Palestinian state depends to a large extent on America's willingness to rebuff -- even by force, if necessary -- Iran's regional designs. And that may well mean that, paradoxically, while Israeli-Palestinian tensions could subside in 2024, US-Iran pressures will need to increase. Either way, more US involvement is required in the short term if Washington wants to divest itself of Middle East quagmires in the future.
 Needless to say, many of these diplomatic scenarios are based on assumptions of what regional actors should do rather than what they are likely to do. And nobody should underestimate the severe difficulties of any diplomacy in the Middle East. 
 As the old grim joke goes, "in the Middle East, things will get much worse before they get much worse".
 Still, the US has played a dramatic role in the current Gaza war, gaining real leverage with Israel. While many people in the region distrust the US, no other international actor has such a decisive influence and the wherewithal to accomplish its objectives.
 And despite all the complications, a deal's contours are pretty simple. As Dr Ziad Asali, founder of the American Task Force on Palestine and himself a Palestinian, movingly remarked recently, "ultimately, though -- no matter what happens in Gaza -- two peoples will still have to share the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. The Israelis aren't leaving, and neither are the Palestinians".

Heavy traffic expected at S'pore-Malaysia land checkpoints over Deepavali holiday

Those planning to visit Malaysia over the Deepavali holiday should expect "very heavy traffic" at both the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said on Monday.
 They are advised to factor in additional waiting time for immigration clearance between Thursday and next Tuesday, given the upcoming public holiday on Sunday and the year-end school holidays.
 Security measures have also been stepped up at the checkpoints in the light of the situation in the Middle East. War broke out on Oct 7 after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostages. Israel has retaliated since, and more than 9,770 Palestinians have been killed. 
 ICA advised motorists to check the traffic situation at both checkpoints on the Land Transport Authority's OneMotoring website or the Expressway Monitoring and Advisory System installed on the Bukit Timah and Ayer Rajah expressways, before embarking on their journey.
 Updates on traffic conditions will also be posted on ICA's Facebook and Twitter accounts, and broadcast on local radio stations Money FM 89.3, Kiss92, One FM 91.3, 96.3 Hao FM and UFM100.3.
 ICA asked motorists to be patient and to observe traffic rules, maintain lane discipline and cooperate with officers on-site when using the land checkpoints.
 It said that it works closely with the Traffic Police to ensure road discipline at the critical junctions and roads leading to the checkpoints.
 "Errant motorists caught queue-cutting will be turned away and made to re-queue," it said.
 In October, four sports cars travelling from Malaysia to Singapore were turned away from the Tuas Checkpoint after cutting the queue when entering Singapore.
 ICA reminded travellers to ensure that their passports have a remaining validity of at least six months.
 "Singapore permanent residents who have renewed their passport will have to transfer their re-entry permit to the new passport," it said. "Long-term pass holders will need to notify ICA or the Ministry of Manpower of any change in their passport particulars before their entry into Singapore."
 During the Children's Day weekend in October, more than 1.27 million travellers used the land checkpoints. Traveller volume peaked on Oct 6 with more than 460,000 crossings, the highest daily figure for land checkpoints since the borders reopened in 2022, said ICA.
 Out of the 460,000 crossings, more than half were departures.
 Those who departed by car had to wait up to three hours before they were cleared during peak periods, ICA added.

Parliament condemns violence against civilians in Israel-Hamas war

Parliament unanimously condemned the violence against innocent civilians in the Israel-Hamas conflict, and stressed that Singapore must never allow external conflicts to disrupt racial and religious harmony here.
 Twenty-one MPs, including those from the People's Action Party (PAP), Workers' Party (WP) and Progress Singapore Party (PSP), spoke on Monday in a debate on a motion on the Israel-Hamas conflict, which was passed after about six hours.
 Speaking in the middle of the debate, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said that beyond upholding national interests, Singapore must not allow external events to divide it. 
 Social media can turn a faraway conflict into an emotionally charged issue that can easily spiral out of control, even here, he added.
 Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said the country's ability to conduct consistent, coherent foreign policy depends on domestic cohesion and consensus.
 He called on all MPs, regardless of party, to be united in upholding the principles essential for Singapore's survival, which had been put forth by three of his party colleagues in a motion on solidarity, security and peace with regard to the conflict.
 Leader of the Opposition and WP chief Pritam Singh said: "This conflict will test us, but it should not be allowed to compromise our multiracial and multi-religious peace and harmony." 
 Singaporeans should not analyse a political issue through religious lenses -- instead it is a humanitarian issue, he added.
 PSP Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai urged Singaporeans of all communities to be mindful of what they say and do concerning this issue, especially on online forums. 
 "We all have the responsibility to refrain from engaging in inflammatory rhetoric that could threaten the peace and harmony that we enjoy in Singapore," he said.
 DPM Wong said Singapore is not immune to divisive forces -- in the month of October alone, the police received eight reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at members of the Jewish or Muslim communities in Singapore.
 This is almost the same number of related reports made between January and September.
 "We cannot afford to be complacent. We know from our own painful history how disastrous ethnic and religious strife can be. And that's why we have worked so hard over the years to foster social harmony across our different communities," said DPM Wong.
 He and Dr Balakrishnan pointed out that when the conflict first erupted, Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir wrote to Singapore's Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abergel, who later replied, and both expressed empathy and solidarity with one another.
 Dr Balakrishnan said this episode is a stark reminder to all Singaporeans that the country's national interests are at stake.
 He added that Singapore must reject terrorism: "No excuses, no ifs, no buts. No short-term political advantage. (We must) reject terrorism. If attacked, all of us here must give the government of the day the ability to exercise the right of self-defence."
 He also emphasised that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not a religious conflict.
 At its core, the conflict has always been about territory, self-determination and identity, which has been complicated by intra-Israeli and intra-Palestinian politics. 
 "It provides fertile ground for extremists on both sides to misuse religion to further their political games, and we must not fall into that trap," said Dr Balakrishnan.
 Monday's motion was raised by three PAP MPs -- Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang GRC), Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC) and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC).
 It put forth six prongs of action with regard to the terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel and the deepening humanitarian crisis arising from Israel's military operations in the Gaza Strip.
 These include expressing condolences to all innocent casualties; advocating the urgent delivery and unhindered access of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza; and condemning those responsible for terrorist acts and violations of international law.
 The motion also called for all parties to ensure the safety and security of civilians, including the release of all hostages; reiterated Singapore's stance on a negotiated two-state solution; and urged the safeguarding of multiracial and multi-religious peace and harmony.
 In his speech, Dr Balakrishnan laid out the principles underpinning the Singapore Government's position on the issue.
 These include a zero-tolerance approach towards terrorism, an abidance by international law that dictates all states have the legitimate and inherent right of self-defence, and that all countries must ensure that if military action is taken in exercising this right of self-defence, that they abide by principles of necessity and proportionality and comply with the laws of war.
 He also stressed the need for humanitarian assistance to reach affected civilian populations immediately, and reiterated Singapore's longstanding and consistent position that a negotiated two-state solution was the only viable option.
 Mr Singh and Mr Leong both said in their speeches that their parties supported the motion.
 Mr Singh also stressed that the latest eruption in hostilities should not be seen in isolation.
 "The same history always repeats itself. In the end, the story on the Palestinian side is always far more gruesome in scale -- overwhelming casualties, with a large number of children among the dead," he added.
 Mr Leong said the PSP urged the Government to enhance education on Israeli-Palestinian history to reduce the risk of Singaporeans being swayed by biased, inaccurate or one-sided emotional discourse.
 Amid the debate, Dr Balakrishnan pressed Mr Singh on why the WP did not categorise the Hamas attacks on Oct 7 as "acts of terror".
 Mr Singh said the reason for not doing so in the party's statement was that Hamas is not included on the list by the inter-ministry committee on terrorist designation, and that he was not questioning the definitions in the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act. 
 DPM Wong said political parties should not try to outflank the Government to score political points.
 "Let's not risk our precious unity for short-term political gain, not when our collective security and fundamental interests are at stake," he said, adding that it was not a nitpicking of words.
 He asked the WP to clarify its position on social media, to which Mr Singh replied that the WP would append its Monday speeches to its Oct 18 statement.
 Mr Singh added that on issues of national security, the Government should inform the WP, which would certainly take those views on board very carefully.
 DPM Wong said the Government has been and will continue doing so from time to time, when there are national security concerns.
 The minister also spoke about the economic and security implications of the conflict on Singapore. For now, the direct economic impact is small, due to Singapore's limited trade and investment linkages with Israel.
 Should the conflict between Israel and Hamas broaden into a regional conflict, there will be wider implications, especially on oil and food prices, so Singaporeans must be prepared for more uncertainties, said DPM Wong.
 On the security front, he said the Government fully expects extremist and terrorist groups in the region to use the conflict to get sentiments riled up and radicalise more individuals. 
 Since the conflict started, regional Internet traffic on extremist sites has gone up threefold and anti-Singapore rhetoric, including violent threats against Singapore by regional extremist elements online, has seen an uptick. 
 Security agencies are on high alert and more security measures have been put in place as a precaution, DPM Wong said.
 "Singaporeans must stay vigilant too... Our ability to respond to any terrorist incident depends on all of us as Singaporeans working together. We must remain cohesive and united as a society, so that we can keep Singapore safe and secure."

8 police reports of offensive remarks or actions against Jews, Muslims made in Oct

 Eight police reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at the Jewish and Muslim communities were lodged here in October, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
 He said this is about the same number of reports received between January and September.
 He added: "It is a very sharp spike."
 And in another sign of the spillover effects of the Israel-Hamas war, DPM Wong told Parliament on Monday that since the conflict started, regional Internet traffic on extremist sites has gone up threefold.
 The Government has also seen more anti-Singapore rhetoric, including violent threats against Singapore by regional extremist elements online.
 DPM Wong was speaking during the debate on a parliamentary motion on the Israel-Hamas conflict.
 Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added that those who engage in offensive conduct are a minority in Singapore and that most Singaporeans have been measured and mature in their response, even where views on the conflict have differed.
 Associate Professor Faishal said: "We may feel deep sympathy for the civilians caught in the crossfire between Israel and Hamas.
 "However, we should be mindful that just as there are those among us who feel more deeply for the Israelis killed or abducted by Hamas, there are also many Singaporeans who are profoundly saddened by the sufferings of the Palestinian people in Gaza."
 DPM Wong said the Government fully expects extremist and terrorist groups in the region to use the conflict to get sentiments riled up and radicalise more individuals.
 He noted the detaining in recent years of Singaporeans who fell for pro-Hamas narratives, and wanted to take up arms overseas.
 He added: "Amidst this conflict, it is more urgent than ever that we prepare for all contingencies. That's why our security agencies are on heightened alert, and we have put in place additional security measures as a precaution."
 DPM Wong added that Singaporeans must stay vigilant by reporting any suspicious behaviour to the authorities.
 He said: "In the end, our ability to respond to any terrorist incident depends on all of us as Singaporeans working together. We must remain cohesive and united as a society, so that we can keep Singapore safe and secure."
 Prof Faishal said the Government takes firm action against acts that threaten Singapore's racial and religious harmony.
 He said Singapore has provisions to do so in the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act and Penal Code.
 The authorities also have powers under the Broadcasting Act to disable access to egregious content, including those likely to cause racial and religious disharmony in Singapore, or which advocates violence or terrorism, he added.
 Prof Faishal said support and concern should be shown in a way that does not lead to conflict and tensions, and is not framed as a clash between religions.
 He added: "Whether it is an Israeli or Palestinian life, it is still a life, and we should be concerned, and should be willing to give help."
 The conflict began when Hamas fighters broke through the border on Oct 7, killing at least 1,400 people in Israel.
 Israel retaliated by bombing Gaza, with officials there saying more than 9,400 have died.
 Prof Faishal said the Government understands Singaporeans' desire to come together to show their concern and support, noting that some have applied to hold assemblies at Speakers' Corner.
 Prof Faishal said five applications to hold events related to the Israel-Hamas conflict were rejected in October. 
 He said these were among the seven applications to use Speakers' Corner that were rejected in the last three years, out of the more than 400 applications submitted. The other two rejected applications were for unrelated events in December 2022 and August 2023.
 To deepen Singaporeans' understanding of the conflict, Mr Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) said during the debate on the motion that schools and higher education institutions should promote classroom discussions on the topic more actively.
 He said: "With teachers or facilitators guiding these discussions, the conversations will be kept balanced and will avoid becoming overly contentious." 
 Prof Faishal noted that Hamas has issued statements calling on all Muslims to fight.
 He said supporters of terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and those in South-east Asia, have celebrated Hamas' attacks. They have called on followers to join in a wider jihad, and Prof Faishal said Singaporeans are not immune to such sentiments.
 He said Singapore's stance -- that it condemns all acts of terrorism -- is clear.
 He added: "Terrorism is not justifiable under any circumstances. Neither will we tolerate people calling for violence. We will take firm action.
 "Our security agencies are watching the situation very closely and have stepped up their alert. Additional measures have been taken, such as enhanced security patrols at certain events and places."

 Prof Faishal said the Government understands Singaporeans' desire to come together to show their concern and support, noting that some have applied to hold assemblies at Speakers' Corner.
 Prof Faishal said five applications to hold events related to the Israel-Hamas conflict were rejected in October. 
 He said these were among the seven applications to use Speakers' Corner that were rejected in the last three years, out of the more than 400 applications submitted. The other two rejected applications were for unrelated events in December 2022 and August 2023.
 To deepen Singaporeans' understanding of the conflict, Mr Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) said during the debate on the motion that schools and higher education institutions should promote classroom discussions on the topic more actively.
 He said: "With teachers or facilitators guiding these discussions, the conversations will be kept balanced and will avoid becoming overly contentious." 
 Prof Faishal noted that Hamas has issued statements calling on all Muslims to fight.
 He said supporters of terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and those in South-east Asia, have celebrated Hamas' attacks. They have called on followers to join in a wider jihad, and Prof Faishal said Singaporeans are not immune to such sentiments.
 He said Singapore's stance -- that it condemns all acts of terrorism -- is clear.
 He added: "Terrorism is not justifiable under any circumstances. Neither will we tolerate people calling for violence. We will take firm action.
 "Our security agencies are watching the situation very closely and have stepped up their alert. Additional measures have been taken, such as enhanced security patrols at certain events and places."

Trump defiant at NY fraud trial, judge threatens to cut off testimonyDonald Trump complained of unfair treatment in defiant and rambling testimony on the witness stand at his New York civil business-fraud trial on Monday, prompting the judge to threaten to cut his testimony short. Under questioning about his company's accounting practices, the former US president repeatedly clashed with Judge Arthur Engoron, who is weighing whether to impose hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and other penalties that could hobble the real estate empire that vaulted Trump to prominence. Engoron warned Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in the 2024 election, that he might remove him from the witness stand if he did not answer questions directly.

The Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades said the strikes came "in response to the occupation's (Israel's) massacres and its aggression against our people in the Gaza Strip". The Israeli army meanwhile reported about 30 projectiles had been fired at northern Israel from Lebanon, adding that it fired back at the direction they had been launched from.

Cost of war in Gaza ultimately falls on Israel and Palestinians

LONDON  The war between Israel and Hamas is generating a humanitarian disaster in the Middle East, although its impact on the world economy remains modest. 
 Matters could change, however, if the war morphs into a broader regional confrontation. 
 Traditionally, oil prices are most directly affected by violence in the Middle East. 
 During the 1973 war between Israel and its neighbours, which led to an embargo on Arab oil sales to the West, prices for this energy commodity jumped by 55 per cent. 
 This time, however, the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct 7 and the subsequent Israeli military response had no concrete impact on oil production or prices. 
 Natural gas prices did rise after the Israeli government ordered the platform serving the offshore Tamar gas field in the Mediterranean Sea to suspend operations due to its proximity to Gaza. 
 But even then, the spike in gas prices was soon offset by the continued operation of the bigger Leviathan field, which is also in Israel's territorial waters. 
 A potential involvement in the war by Hezbollah, the Iranian-funded militia in Lebanon, changes the equation because it may beget a confrontation between the United States and Iran. 
 And this will spook energy markets, as well as add pressure on Muslim oil producers to punish Israel and its Western backers. 
 Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has already urged Islamic states to stop exporting oil.
 Muslims, the Iranian cleric said, "should block ways of oil and foodstuff exports to the Zionist regime". 
 Still, the expectation is that most Arab producers will resist calls for an embargo, and that even if a broader Middle Eastern war reduces oil supplies, the impact on global prices will not be anywhere as high as it was in the past. 
 The strategic oil reserves of major industrialised nations are currently full. 
 And oil is no longer so critical: It now accounts for only a third of the world's total primary energy consumption, compared with more than 50 per cent when Arab states first tried to implement an oil embargo half a century ago. 
 Ultimately, the cost of the war falls directly on Israel and the Palestinians. 
 Over the past two decades, the Israeli economy has weathered previous short wars with Hamas (in 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2021) as well as a major confrontation with Hezbollah in 2006, with surprising ease. 
 On average, Israel's economy has grown by 4.2 per cent in real terms over the past decade. 
 However, the shekel, Israel's currency, sank to its lowest level in 11 years soon after the October attack by Hamas, mainly because of a prevailing opinion among economists that this time, Israel's economy will suffer real damage. 
 Israel's high-tech industry, which accounts for about a fifth of the Jewish state's gross domestic product (GDP) and no less than half of its export revenues, has been in a slump for more than a year amid a global sector downturn. 
 But it is especially vulnerable to losses during this war because its workforce is primarily young and male, precisely the people now called up to serve on the Gaza front. 
 Israel has mobilised more than 350,000 reservists, or about 8 per cent of its total labour force, far more than in previous operations. 
 In addition, 150,000 West Bank Palestinians and 18,500 Palestinian Gazans with permits to work in Israel are now banned, and since the start of the war, some 2,000 Thai migrant farm workers have also left the country. 
 The result is a severe labour shortage, feeding rising prices and inflation. 
 Tourism, which contributed around 6 per cent to Israel's GDP, is also in the doldrums, with most airlines cancelling flights. 
 Israel's Finance Ministry estimates that the direct costs of the current war stand at around US$250 million (S$338 million) per day. 
 And even if the war ends soon, it will skew Israel's finances for years to come. 
 Israel already spends a steep 4.5 per cent of its GDP on defence, compared with 3.1 per cent in the US, and around 2 per cent in Europe. 
 Still, the economic blow suffered by Israel is nothing in comparison to the impact of the fighting on Gaza. 
 Hamas, which ruled Gaza for more than a decade, cared nothing for its economy. 
 Even before the war, annual income per capita in Gaza was only US$1,257, a quarter of what Palestinians in the West Bank earn and barely a 10th of what Palestinian workers are paid in Israel. 
 Half of residents in the Gaza Strip already lived in abject poverty; before the current crisis, unemployment among men stood at 39 per cent, and among young people, as high as 74 per cent. 
 The war has already displaced half of Gaza's population and decimated the territory's housing stock. 
 Therefore, a massive emergency economic assistance programme will be required when the guns fall silent. 
 And this is before anyone even considers whether Hamas should be allowed to continue to rule -- or misrule -- the territory.

Israel says its forces operating in 'heart of Gaza City'Israel said on Tuesday its forces were operating deep in Gaza City in their battle to wipe out Hamas in the Palestinian enclave, and that the Islamist militant group's leader was trapped inside a bunker. Gaza residents said earlier that Israeli tanks were positioned on the outskirts of Gaza City, Hamas' stronghold in the north of the territory and home to about a third of its 2.3 million people before the hostilities. Israel previously said it had surrounded Gaza City and would would soon attack it to annihilate Hamas fighters who assaulted Israeli towns across the border one month ago. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israeli soldiers were operating in the heart of Gaza City. 
Hamas' most senior leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, was isolated in his bunker, Mr Gallant said, in a televised news conference.

Ties with Israel hinge on Palestinian issue: Saudi minister

Byline: , Ties with Israel hinge on Palestinian issue: Saudi minister
Body


The normalisation of Saudi Arabia's relations with Israel remains on the table despite a setback from the Israel-Hamas war and is "contingent on a pathway to a peaceful resolution" of the Palestinian issue, said Mr Khalid Al-Falih, the kingdom's Investment Minister. 
 Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was clear on this point during previous discussions on normalisation, said Mr Al-Falih, at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum at Capella Singapore hotel on Wednesday. 
 "The setback over the last month has clarified why Saudi Arabia was so adamant that a resolution to the Palestinian conflict has to be part of a broader normalisation in the Middle East," he said. 
 The establishment of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, brokered by the United States, would be a major milestone in Arab-Israeli relations. 
 In September, before the onset of the war, the Saudi crown prince had told US media outlet Fox News that "every day we get closer" to normalisation.
 The war broke out on Oct 7 when Hamas fighters burst across the fence enclosing Gaza and killed 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians. Since then, Israel has laid siege on the coastal strip, killing more than 10,000 people.
 "The Palestinian people have had their basic rights taken away, and the right for statehood and peaceful existence unfulfilled, and it's time to use this awful situation now to bring that to the fore and to resolve it," Mr Al-Falih added.
 Speaking at the same session, Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said the recent developments in the Gaza Strip illustrated that the Palestinian issue needs to be resolved "right up front".
 In the initial euphoria of the Abraham Accords, there was a sense that the focus was on economic development, and that "maybe somehow, wishfully, magically, the unresolved political questions will disappear", he recounted.
 The Abraham Accords, which the US helped to broker, are a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and Arab nations signed in 2020. Saudi Arabia is not among the signatories.
 Dr Balakrishnan said that in his view, there was no viable alternative to the resolution of the Palestinian issue besides a two-state solution. But it was problematic that support for a two-state solution among both the Palestinian and Israeli people had been falling in recent decades.
 "If you think carefully about it, one state must mean, by definition, the violent elimination of the other people," he said.
 "You need cool-headed people in the middle of the political milieu, on both the Palestinians and the Israeli side, to get together and say, look, how are we going to live and let live'" 
 Earlier in the week, Singapore's Parliament unanimously condemned the violence against innocent civilians in the Israel-Hamas conflict, and stressed that Singapore must never allow external conflicts to disrupt racial and religious harmony in the city state.
 Speaking during a separate session at the forum, Mr Thomas R. Nides, the former US ambassador to Israel from December 2021 to July 2023, said in retrospect that it was a mistake the Palestinians were not part of the normalisation agreements.
 Mr Al-Falih said Saudi Arabia is looking to work towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict by convening a series of summits in the coming days.
 Riyadh will host an emergency Arab League summit on Saturday, and an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation extraordinary summit on Sunday. 
 It will also convene a summit with African nations, said Mr Al-Falih, without specifying a date. It was originally scheduled for Saturday.
 He said that Saudi Arabia had, decades ago, put forward an Arab peace plan, which "saw a way forward for a normal Middle East" -- wherein all countries had normal relationships and could focus on economic prosperity. 
 "We remain eager to see that plan come into fruition for a peaceful process," he added.
 In 2002, Saudi Arabia put forward a peace plan that was adopted as the Arab Peace Initiative at the Arab League Summit in Beirut that year. 
 In the initiative, Arab nations offered Israel normal ties in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in 1967.
 Both Mr Al-Falih and Dr Balakrishnan were speaking during a panel discussion on "The Rise of Economic Statecraft" moderated by Ms Stephanie Flanders, Bloomberg's head of economics and government. 
 Asked if Saudi Arabia would use economic tools such as the price of oil to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, Mr Al-Falih replied: "That is not on the table today. Saudi Arabia is trying to find peace through peaceful discussions."

Protests around the world against the retaliatory Israeli bombardment of Gaza, which has taken more than 10,000 lives now, reveal the agony and anger felt by thousands over the heavy price being paid by Palestinian civilians for the terrorist attack on Israel that was carried out by the militant group Hamas on Oct 7. Rampaging Hamas attackers had killed 1,400 people and taken around 200 hostages. Israel responded by launching an air offensive, which continues, and then a ground offensive, which has just begun, against the heavily populated Palestinian enclave. As the number of Palestinian fatalities continues to keep far outstripping the number of Israeli innocents who were slaughtered, public opinion in many parts of the world is calling for an end to the deaths and suffering of Palestinians. Protests in the Middle East have spread to demonstrations and solidarity marches in New York, London, Berlin, Paris, Istanbul, Lahore, New Delhi, Dhaka, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Sydney, among many other cities. 
 Clearly, the Israel-Hamas war is no longer a Middle Eastern problem. It has turned into a global issue, one in which many Muslims and other supporters of the Palestinian cause are voicing their opposition to Israel's actions. To the extent that they wish to further the humanitarian interests of besieged Gazans, and so long as protests do not threaten public order, this opposition attests to the need for a proportionate Israeli response even to the enormity of the Hamas attack. Humans cannot but respond instinctively when innocent Palestinian civilians, particularly children, die in air strikes that flatten entire neighbourhoods into anonymous rubble.
 However, there is a parallel need to prevent extremist groups from radicalising ground sentiments in order to fuel their own nefarious agendas by exploiting anger and directing it towards violence in their own societies or abroad. South-east Asia is not immune to the danger. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong told Parliament on Monday that regional Internet traffic on extremist sites has gone up threefold since the Israel-Hamas war began. Worryingly, too, the Government has seen more anti-Singapore rhetoric, including violent threats against Singapore made by regional extremist elements online. It would be natural to expect extremist and terrorist groups in the region to use the conflict to rile up sentiments and radicalise more individuals. Singapore stands in danger of becoming a target although it has nothing to do with the Israel-Hamas war. In fact, eight police reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at the Jewish and Muslim communities were lodged here in October. 
 Singaporeans cannot decide the outcome of the Israel-Hamas war. What they can and must do is to stay vigilant so that its toxic ripples do not arrive at Singapore's shores to poison racial and religious harmony here.

It would be natural to expect extremist and terrorist groups in the region to use the conflict to rile up sentiments and radicalise more individuals. Singapore stands in danger of becoming a target although it has nothing to do with the Israel-Hamas war. In fact, eight police reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at the Jewish and Muslim communities were lodged here in October. Singaporeans cannot decide the outcome of the Israel-Hamas war. What they can and must do is to stay vigilant so that its toxic ripples do not arrive at Singapore's shores to poison racial and religious harmony here.

Israeli army shows devastation in northern GazaBlackened windows, shattered bedrooms, pockmarked walls. Wherever you look in northern Gaza, you see destruction and desolation a month into Israel's military campaign to oust Hamas from the enclave. Israeli forces gave a small group of foreign reporters a rare view of their advance into the Palestinian territory on Wednesday, driving them along sandy routes, churned by tank tracks, to the fringes of Gaza City. Stopping at a cluster of apartment blocks, every building within sight is scarred by battle. 
Walls have been blown away, bullet holes and shrapnel dot the facades, the palm trees are shredded and broken. "It's been a long two weeks of fighting. It is not an operation, it is a war," said Lieutenant-Colonel Ido, deputy commander of the 401st brigade. He did not give his last name. "It is going to last a long time, until Hamas no longer exists."

"I am not involved in his personal financial statements," the former president's elder daughter said on the witness stand on Wednesday in the civil fraud trial against Donald Trump and his real estate company, which the state accuses of inflating assets. The state alleged Donald Trump had just US$1.6 billion in assets in 2011, when he claimed a net worth of US$4.3 billion.

Israel-Hamas war, 2024 polls raise terror attack risk in Indonesia

Byline: Hariz Baharudin, Israel-Hamas war, 2024 polls raise terror attack risk in Indonesia
Body


JAKARTA  Heightened tensions from the Israel-Hamas conflict and the upcoming contentious presidential election in Indonesia have created a volatile environment that could inflame emotions, thus increasing the risk of terrorist attacks. 
 Security experts warned that the recent arrests of 59 people suspected of plotting attacks to disrupt the polls in 2024 will unlikely be the last batch of radicals to be picked up.
 Indonesia's anti-terror police said the suspects had allegedly planned to target police facilities to disrupt the presidential and legislative elections on Feb 14.
 During the nearly month-long arrests in October, the Detachment 88 counter-terrorism task force (Densus 88) also seized firearms, bomb-making chemicals and propaganda materials. 
 While the militant threat in Indonesia has diminished significantly due to successful security force operations, the recent arrests show that the terrorism threat very much remains in the country, which has seen large-scale terror attacks like the Bali bombings of 2002 that killed more than 200 people.
 Dr Noor Huda Ismail, a visiting fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said the intricate nature of terrorist networks and the persistent influence of radical ideologies mean that individuals or groups with similar extremist views and violent intentions may still be out there. 
 The upcoming elections -- including the three-way fight among presidential candidates with massive followings -- and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas have the potential to create narratives that extremist groups will exploit to rile up people. 
 "Radical groups often exploit ongoing conflicts and political instability to promote their ideologies and recruit new members," said Dr Noor Huda, whose work focuses on terrorism in the region.
 "In the context of the conflict in Gaza and the upcoming election, radical groups might use these events to fuel anti-establishment sentiments, exploit grievances, and foster a sense of victimhood among vulnerable populations."
 Countries including Britain, Germany and Belgium have arrested suspects in terror plots linked to the Israel-Hamas war. 
 On Monday, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in Parliament that violent threats against the Republic by regional extremist groups online have gone up since the outbreak of hostilities.
 He revealed that since the conflict in the Middle East started on Oct 7, regional Internet traffic on extremist sites has gone up threefold and that the Government has seen more anti-Singapore rhetoric, including violent threats from regional extremist elements.
 Eight police reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at Jewish and Muslim communities were lodged in Singapore in October, which is about the same number of reports lodged between January and September. This is a very sharp spike, said DPM Wong. 
 Indonesia has so far not reported any significant threat tied to the conflict in the Middle East. 
 At a rally on Sunday, tens of thousands of people gathered at the National Monument park in Jakarta to express solidarity with the Palestinians. The event went by peacefully, with attendees chanting prayers and listening to speeches that called for an immediate cessation of violence in the Gaza Strip.
 Dr Noor Huda and other experts noted that the convergence of the conflict in the Middle East and the elections in Indonesia exemplifies the concept of "glocalisation", which he said refers to the interconnectedness of global events and their localised impacts. 
 Three major elections in Indonesia -- the 2017 Jakarta election, and both the 2014 and 2019 presidential elections -- were highly divisive and drew a political cleavage between Islamists and pluralists, with some causing riots to erupt. 
 "In this context, the intertwining of global conflicts and local political dynamics in Indonesia highlights the interconnected nature of sociopolitical issues, underscoring how events in one part of the world can resonate with and influence local sentiments and actions," said Dr Noor Huda.
 The current situation is a "political tinderbox", given the heightened tensions from the Middle East conflict and the polarisation of domestic nationalist feelings due to the elections, said Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at policy and business consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore. 
 "The intermix of an external conflict stirring up domestic emotions in the spirit of Muslim brotherliness and a presidential election that is expected to intensify and capitalise on the fault lines and undercurrents in Indonesian society makes the domestic situation extremely volatile and a discernible threat to national security," said Dr Mustafa, who is also a visiting professor in international relations at the Islamic University of Indonesia. 
 Among the suspects recently arrested, 40 of them were from Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, Indonesia's largest terror group, which has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
 Were it not for the recent arrests by Densus 88, dozens of people might be killed during the presidential election and potentially other events too, said Mr Muh Taufiqurrohman, a senior researcher at the Jakarta-based Centre for Radicalism and Deradicalisation Studies think-tank.
 "Pro-ISIS extremists' ability to acquire firearms and make explosives, as shown by Abu Umar's group, make the situation more dangerous," he said, referring to the terrorist who in 2011 plotted to attack the police and Singapore embassy in Jakarta, among other places.
 A potential flashpoint to watch out for is the 2023 Fifa U-17 World Cup in Indonesia from Nov 10 to Dec 2. 
 He noted that among the 24 participating countries are nations seen to be pro-Israeli, like the United States and Germany.
 All the experts whom The Straits Times spoke to warned of an uptick in terrorist recruitment, which Mr Muh said has been a trend on social media and gaming forums like Discord.
 Besides online recruitment, Dr Noor Huda highlighted that terrorist groups could exploit the uncertainty and social unrest generated by the current situation to target individuals who feel marginalised or disenfranchised.
 "By capitalising on people's grievances and disillusionment, they can attempt to recruit new members who are susceptible to their ideologies," he said. 
 He suggested that beyond calling for people to be vigilant, the authorities in Indonesia should also develop a cohesive and integrated framework that promotes information sharing, joint training programmes, and unified strategies to effectively combat the threat of terrorism.
 In the archipelago, multiple agencies like Densus 88 as well as the National Counter-Terrorism Agency deal with terrorism, but critics have pointed out that the lack of effective collaboration poses significant obstacles to implementing counter-terrorism measures. 
 "By fostering a culture of collaboration and coordination, Indonesian authorities can strengthen their collective capacity to address the complex and evolving nature of terrorist threats and enhance the overall security landscape in the country," he said.

Religious leaders can help maintain harmony: Shanmugam

Byline: Andrew Wong, Religious leaders can help maintain harmony: Shanmugam
Body


Religious leaders can help to calm tension within their communities to maintain the inter-religious harmony that is unique to Singapore, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said.
 This comes amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza which began on Oct 7, when Hamas fighters launched an attack in Israel, killing around 1,400 people there.
 Israel retaliated by bombing Gaza, with the Hamas-run health ministry saying that more than 10,000 have died so far, including more than 4,000 children. 
 Mr Shanmugam said the harmony in Singapore is precious, and everyone will have to play a part to uphold the peace.
 This despite some comments made recently that religious leaders should not be involved in such issues, he said. 
 Said Mr Shanmugam: "I am at a loss to understand why some think this. This is not how we have the peace and harmony that we have today in Singapore."
 He was speaking to about 100 guests and members of the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO), and religious leaders, at the screening of a locally produced film, Technologies Of The Soul, at One Raffles Quay on Wednesday. It is a documentary about religion and tradition within Singapore's evolving technological society. 
 Mr Shanmugam pointed out that after the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the then Mufti of Singapore, Mr Syed Isa Semait, condemned the act and emphasised that suicide bombings are against the teachings of Islam. 
 In 2014, Singapore Archbishop William Goh issued guidance on how to pray for victims of the escalating violence in Gaza, as well as how to help with financial aid. 
 That year, Israel invaded Gaza over a period of 50 days. More than 2,200 Palestinians, 66 Israeli soldiers and five Israeli civilians were killed.
 "So it's quite usual, and indeed important, for religious leaders to weigh in on matters that concern people in their communities," Mr Shanmugam said. 
 Religious leaders can also help foster acceptance, peace and common humanity across religions in Singapore. 
 He said: "We draw the line between religion and politics, but it's important that religious leaders give guidance to their communities on prayer, on assisting, on how they can help others in distress."
 This has been one of the key reasons the situation in Singapore has managed to remain calm, he pointed out. 
 Just a week after the Israel-Hamas war started, Chief Rabbi Mordechai Abergel and the Mufti of Singapore, Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, exchanged letters to affirm the friendship between Jews and Muslims in Singapore. 
 Mr Shanmugam said: "We have also seen how rhetoric by religious leaders can inflame, rather than reduce tensions."
 He added: "People in the region say, that if you're not a Muslim, it is difficult to be of that country's nationality -- in Malaysia or Indonesia; or if you are not a Buddhist, it is difficult for you to be accepted as a Thai, and so on.
 "But in Singapore, people say it doesn't matter what religion you are, you can be a Singaporean." 
 Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in Parliament on Monday that eight police reports of offensive remarks or actions targeted at the Jewish and Muslim communities here were lodged in October, about the same as the number of cases reported between January and September.
 Regional Internet traffic on extremist sites has gone up threefold since the conflict started on Oct 7, he added. 
 In comparison, more than 1,000 anti-Semitic acts have been reported in France since Oct 7, and there has been a 10-fold increase in anti-Muslim sentiment in Australia since the start of the conflict, Mr Shanmugam said. 
 The Government has also seen more anti-Singapore rhetoric, including violent threats against Singapore by regional extremist elements online, Mr Wong said in Parliament.
 The threat has grown as technology advances in Singapore. 
 IRO president Noor Marican said that if used wrongly, technology could be detrimental to religious harmony in Singapore. 
 He said: "Technology can also serve as a conduit for disseminating violent extremist narratives, ultimately leading to the self-radicalisation of individuals."
 In 2021, a 16-year-old was detained by the Internal Security Department for planning an attack on mosques after watching a live stream of an attack on mosques in New Zealand. 
 In the same year, a 20-year-old was detained for planning to attack Jews at the Maghain Aboth Synagogue in Waterloo Street. He was reportedly planning to travel to Gaza to join Hamas. 
 Said Mr Shanmugam: "In Singapore, we express solidarity and unity in our shared humanity. Religion does not need to divide us. It should help to bring us together."

No alternative to two-state solution to resolve conflict in Middle East, says PM Lee

Body


A two-state solution is the only long-term answer to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in the Middle East, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Wednesday night.
 Speaking during a dialogue with editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News John Micklethwait at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum, he acknowledged that such a solution is very difficult and "looks way over the horizon".
 "But the alternative to a two-state solution is a one-state solution. That means one side or the other has to be squeezed out. That is unimaginable. So if you cannot work towards a two-state solution, you are going to be in this cycle of mutual destruction for generations to come," he said.
 PM Lee reiterated Singapore's stand on the conflict, noting that it takes into consideration the country's national interests, as well as the sentiments of its people.
 He added that its position rests on several principles: National borders are inviolate, countries have the right of self-defence and the killing of innocent civilians is against international humanitarian law. 
 He called what happened on Oct 7, when Hamas killed 1,400 people in Israel and seized more than 240 hostages, not just against international law but also a "horrendous terrorist attack on an enormous scale". 
 "We fully understand how the Israelis feel about it, and why they have reacted the way they have done. But what has happened since then in Gaza, as a consequence of Israeli operations, is an enormous human tragedy," said PM Lee, noting that the death toll is ticking up every day.
 Earlier this week, the death toll from Israeli strikes in Gaza exceeded 10,000, according to the Gaza health authorities. 
 PM Lee said: "Everybody around the world looked at this in despair, and said surely this has to stop. Whatever the rights and wrongs, you must pay attention to the humanitarian considerations."
 He added that it was important to recognise both the evil things which were done in the Oct 7 attack and also the very, very tragic things that are currently happening in Gaza.
 "We have to exhort the Israelis and everybody else to abide by international norms, and to have a consideration for innocent civilians," said PM Lee.
 Asked if he was concerned about the war affecting regional security, especially in the light of his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim expressing support for the Palestinians, PM Lee said that diplomatic support is not the difficulty, but terrorism is the threat.
 He cited lone wolf attacks in Europe and in the United States since the war began, and said: "It can happen in this part of the world."
 PM Lee noted that self-radicalised individuals were picked up in Singapore before. This includes teenagers who bought bulletproof vests and knives and wanted to fight in the Middle East on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or emulate the Christchurch shooting and attack Muslims in mosques here.
 "There are still terrorist groups within the region which have not disappeared," said PM Lee, citing the Islamic militant group Jemaah Islamiyah, whose members were arrested here in 2001 before they launched their planned attacks.
 "They are watching. Some of their followers will surely be riled up and they may plan something. So we have to take it very seriously," said PM Lee.
 Turning to the war in Ukraine, PM Lee opined that it would be a long and difficult fight because Russia is not going to declare that it has lost.
 "Russia has already failed in its objective of overcoming Ukraine. And that is a great plus for the world," said PM Lee. 
 He explained that if Russia had been able to launch a sudden and overwhelming takeover successfully and a new border was drawn, the world would be a much more dangerous place.
 However, he questioned how long Ukraine's supporters can keep it up and how the mood might change in the US, with elections due next November.
 Asked by Mr Micklethwait if Russia's failure to overwhelm Ukraine might have changed the thinking in China about going into Taiwan, PM Lee said he did not think the Chinese would ever have thought lightly about going into Taiwan.
 "I am sure they must make the calculations, but I do not believe that they are trigger-happy," said PM Lee.
 He acknowledged that China would like Taiwan to be part of "One China", but said: "I believe if they are not provoked, if events do not spin out of control -- I do not believe that you are going to wake up one day and find that they have decided to launch D-Day."
 In speaking of China's current objectives, PM Lee said the country is determined to develop and rightly believes it "will get there one way or the other".
 "You can hold them back a few years. You can deny them technology. They will develop their own -- it may not be as good, but they will have something, and they are determined to show their people and show the world that it can be done." he said.
 Its challenge is to develop in a way that allows it to feel pride in itself, while still inspiring confidence and tranquillity among the rest of the world.
 He explained that when a big country like China takes action, it can cause reverberations everywhere without quite realising it.
 "It will take a while to get the right feel, for the Chinese to be able to grow taller and stronger and yet, keep everybody onside and on good terms," PM Lee said, adding that he believes China is trying to do so.
 Mr Micklethwait also brought up US-China ties, which had been a talking point at previous editions of the forum. US President Joe Biden is slated to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco next week, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
 PM Lee said that the meeting is a "necessary step in this difficult moment in the relationship", but he cautioned that the differences between the two countries are deeply rooted.
 He added: "You need the meeting to head in the right direction, but you do not expect a meeting to make everything sweetness and light again. It is not possible."
 PM Lee explained that in the United States, the only thing the Democrats and Republicans agree on is that China is a grave threat. Meanwhile, in China, there is a strong consensus that the US is out to block it, and that it should protect itself against the US.
 "When you have such views on both sides, even to want to think about stretching out and talking about a more constructive future is difficult," he said.

Israel-Hamas war boosting Trump's presidential election bid

Body


WASHINGTON The bloody conflict in the Middle East is turning into a heated campaign issue in the United States, further boosting Republican front runner Donald Trump's chances in the 2024 presidential election while exposing a chasm in the Democratic Party to the disadvantage of President Joe Biden. 
 More Americans think of Israel as a like-minded nation, but they also worry whether the country is reacting with disproportionate force to an Oct 7 attack by Gaza-based Hamas that took around 1,400 Israeli lives.  
 One month after the attack, a new poll from The Associated Press-Norc Centre for Public Affairs Research shows that 44 per cent of Americans said Israel shares US interests and values, compared with only 32 per cent in August.   
 However, 40 per cent of them also say that Israel has gone too far in its response, killing more than 10,000 people with heavy bombardment of the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian estimates. 
 Among the Democrats, some 58 per cent believe Israel has reacted excessively, versus 18 per cent of Republicans in the poll of 1,239 adults, which was conducted from Nov 2 to 6.
 Mr Biden's stand on Israel has evolved since the war began, perhaps reflecting the sentiment within his party. 
 He first pledged "unwavering support" for Israel, travelled to Tel Aviv in October and embraced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 Then he offered a cautionary note, saying that Israel should not occupy Gaza. 
 He also asked Israel for a "pause" to minimise civilian casualties, but has appeared reluctant to support calls for a ceasefire made by the United Nations and several countries.  
 Dissent within the Democratic Party came into public view this week when 22 Democrats joined nearly all Republicans in the House of Representatives to formally rebuke Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib -- the first Palestinian American to be elected to the chamber -- for her rhetoric about Israel.
 During a pro-Palestinian protest in Washington on Nov 4, Ms Tlaib had accused Mr Biden of supporting the "genocide" of Palestinians. 
 "Mr President, the American people are not with you on this one," she had said. "We will remember in 2024."
 Last month, 15 House Democrats refused to vote for a bipartisan resolution that declared solidarity with Israel and condemned Hamas.
 About 1 per cent of Americans identify as Jewish, with a similar proportion who identify as Muslim, and both communities tend to be largely Democratic supporters. 
 Within the party, the progressive wing -- including the younger generation and non-whites -- tends to be more liberal, anti-war and outraged at the rising death toll in Gaza and critical of Israel's response. 
 Last week, nearly 20 per cent of the Democratic National Committee's roughly 300 employees signed a letter asking the President to demand a ceasefire.
 Such calls are seen as anti-Semitic by others in the party, who think a ceasefire would embolden Hamas. 
 In the Florida state legislature this week, for instance, a motion by a Democrat who tried to convince fellow House members to support de-escalation and a ceasefire mustered just two votes in favour.
 The contrast with the Republican camp could not be sharper. 
 At Wednesday's Republican Party primary debate, all five candidates backed Israel's military operations and criticised rising anti-Semitic threats at home, particularly in college campuses.
 Front runner Trump, who again skipped the debate, spoke at a rally in a Hispanic-dominated area of Florida, where he said the attack on Israel would not have happened had he been in office.
 The former president's pronounced hold on Republican voters is growing. 
 A recent poll of party voters by Quinnipiac University showed support for him grew from 42 per cent in February to 53 per cent in June, and stands at 64 per cent currently. 
 His legal troubles, with court appearances splashed across television screens this week, have stoked sympathy for him rather than concerns about his electability.
 He is also finding a surprising surge in support from young voters, working-class Americans and the African-American community -- the key constituents of Mr Biden's voter coalition in the 2020 presidential election. 
 In a particularly worrying trend for the President one year before the Nov 5, 2024, election, a poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College found that voters preferred Trump in five of the six most important battleground states.
 The poll, conducted between Oct 22 and Nov 3, surveyed 3,662 registered voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 
 When asked who would "do a better job" on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the poll showed that 50 per cent chose Trump, while 39 per cent picked Mr Biden.
 For Mr Biden, the polls add to increasingly louder concerns about his re-election bid, which have centred on concerns about his handling of the economy and perceptions about his age -- although at 80, he is just three years older than Trump. 
 In September, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius set tongues wagging when he said Mr Biden was not the "right candidate" for the next election and should consider withdrawing from the race.
 This week, more damaging criticism followed, from influential Democratic strategist and Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod.
 "If he continues to run, he will be the nominee of the Democratic Party. What he needs to decide is whether that is wise; whether it's in his best interest or the country's'" Mr Axelrod said in a recent tweet.

Watermelon emojis flood social media in Indonesia, Malaysia

JAKARTA A wave of sliced watermelon emojis is overwhelming the social media landscape in Indonesia and Malaysia in a show of support for Palestinians, causing at least one company to disable the comments section of its account as it tries to manage its public messaging while the Israel-Hamas war rages on.
 A sliced watermelon has four colours: the fruit's flesh is red, the seeds are black, the outer shell is green and the inner shell white. These are the same colours as the Palestinian flag.
 The emoji had flooded social media pages after claims by those posting it that overt Palestinian symbols are restricted by United States-headquartered social media platforms such as Instagram and X, formerly known as Twitter.
 KFC Indonesia has disabled the comments section of its Instagram account following harsh words and insults thrown at the American restaurant chain. The company has not issued a statement on the issue. 
 This is as it and other American restaurant chains and products are also facing boycotts in the two South-east Asian countries with Muslim majorities as anger rises over US support for Israel and its war on Gaza.
 While the Palestinian flag emoji is widely used on social media postings as a show of support, others use the watermelon slice as their profile pictures or in postings about the Gaza war.
 Mr Guruh Riyanto, 36, a resident of Bekasi, West Java province, a Catholic devotee who uses a picture of a sliced watermelon as his profile photo, told The Straits Times: "It is a sign of solidarity (with) the Palestinians in Gaza and a reminder that a lot of people are suffering there, because of an aggression, a war crime." 
 A non-American company that got tangled in the flurry of boycott calls was Grab, the regional food deliveries, mobility and e-wallets giant. This followed viral postings in social media showing Ms Chloe Tong, the wife of company co-founder Anthony Tan, saying she was "heartbroken", and that she had fallen "completely in love with Israel" after two recent visits. 
 Pictures and videos on TikTok and other social media platforms showed users uninstalling the superapp from their phones, and one Grab worker removing a Grab food bag from his motorcycle.
 X platform user BagindO KOpi said: "Yes that is your business (to love Israel). My business is to uninstall Grab from my Android, that is all."
 Grab last Friday referred to "a social media post that has been circulating", saying it was "on the side of humanity and hopes for peace and a ceasefire".
 "We do not support any form of violence and as a participant of the United Nations Global Compact, we are aligned with its principles and respect the protection of human rights," it said.
 Meanwhile, sales at many branches of Starbucks and KFC in Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population, have recently slumped following boycott calls, as consumers became upset after reading on social media these companies' alleged support for Israel.
 Similar boycotts are happening in Malaysia involving many American fast-food franchises, after photos of Israeli troops posing with these brands' fried chicken, burgers and coffee cups were posted online. There have also been news reports that some franchises have been giving free food to Israeli soldiers.
 In Indonesia, among those affected is Mr Rudy Syamsuddin, a Starbucks franchisee with an outlet in Makassar, South Sulawesi, who said daily sales had dropped to around 12 million rupiah (S$1,000) since last Friday, from 25 million rupiah normally.
 "We are feeling how powerful the effect of social media is on the community, on the real world," Mr Rudy told The Straits Times by telephone on Wednesday.
 Indonesian netizens voiced protests against Starbucks after the US company criticised its workers' union for sharing a social media post that read "Solidarity with Palestine!" and argued the post reflected the union's support for violence perpetrated by Hamas.
 Indonesian consumers have also shunned McDonald's and KFC outlets, accusing the restaurant chains of supporting the Israel Defence Forces. 
 Starbucks Indonesia's Instagram posts have been filled with netizens calling for a boycott of the brand, but some were against it.
  "I used to love your green tea latte, but now I think it's OK not to buy any more because I stand with the Palestinian people," said Ms Ira Hapsari, a digital designer with Jakarta-based Langitmerah Production, in a post.  
 Consumers who own prepaid Starbucks' cards have been asking to withdraw their funds. Instagram user Silvia Dewi Kamaludin posted last week: "How do we transfer, withdraw our balance on our Starbucks prepaid card? I have quite a lot on my balance." 
 Observers including Mr Riza Widyarsa, who teaches international relations at Jakarta-based Paramadina University, said the boycott movement of the products made by companies deemed as supporters of Israel would likely last only several months.  
 Mr I. Made Anom Wiranata of the University of Udayana in Bali agrees, pointing out that most of these restaurant chains' outlets across Indonesian cities have continued to operate normally, stressing that only some have been affected.

New Israeli, Palestinian leadership needed for long-term peace deal: Hillary Clinton

New Israeli and Palestinian leadership is needed for any chance at a long-term peace deal, especially a two-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East, said former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton on Thursday. 
 "Hamas is not a partner for any kind of peace or two-state solution," she said, but added that the Palestinian Authority and the new leadership in the Gaza Strip after the war might be.
 The former top US diplomat was speaking via a video link at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, in dialogue with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait.
 Asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be a potential partner for a two-state solution, she replied: "I don't think there is any evidence of that. I think the Israeli people will have to decide about his leadership."
 A poll conducted by Israel's Ma'ariv newspaper in mid-October found that as many as 80 per cent of Israelis believe Mr Netanyahu must take responsibility for the security failures exposed by Hamas' attack on Israel.
 On Oct 7, Hamas fighters breached Israel's heavily fortified border fence with Gaza and killed 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians. Since then, Israel has laid siege to the coastal strip, killing more than 10,000 people, including children.
 Mrs Clinton said Israel was unlikely to agree to a ceasefire at this point. This would effectively "freeze the situation in Hamas' favour", and would not undermine the militant group's capacity to launch yet another attack on Israel.
 But Israel was perhaps willing to have humanitarian pauses in the fighting, so that aid could enter Gaza to help civilians there and hostages taken by Hamas could leave, she added.
 Asked if the United States felt overextended by the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, Mrs Clinton said that obtaining funding to support Israel and Ukraine as well as to keep US alliances strong would be challenging, but possible with tough negotiations.
 In October, US President Joe Biden requested US$106 billion (S$144 billion) in congressional funding for Ukraine, Israel, humanitarian assistance including to Gaza, US border security and to counter China's regional efforts in Asia.
 The White House said on Wednesday that the US' funds for Ukraine were 96 per cent depleted. 
 The US, Europe and other like-minded countries need to continue supporting Ukraine with the military equipment it needs, so that Ukrainians can defend themselves and "push as far as they can push", said Mrs Clinton.
 She spoke for about 25 minutes at the forum, which was attended by global corporate and government leaders at Capella Singapore hotel.
 Asked to comment on the highly anticipated meeting between Mr Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping slated to take place in San Francisco next week, she said this was a confidence-building opportunity.
 There has been a "real chill coming from China" towards American businesses and political pressures against China within the American political system.
 "This meeting is a terrific opportunity to try to reset the table," she said, but added that this has to be followed with many more interactions. 
 Mrs Clinton expressed hope that Mr Xi would signal that "he sees it in China's interest to really dig in with President Biden", develop platforms for discussions and problem-solving as well as find ways to cooperate on issues of mutual interest. 
 "I think he will find a receptive partner with President Biden, if that's available," she added.
 Mr Micklethwait also asked Mrs Clinton to comment on US economic engagements with Asia, observing that while South-east Asian countries were not able to secure trade deals with the US, they enjoyed "a whole menu of economic possibilities" with China. 
 Mrs Clinton said the US needs "a new era of realistic trade agreements" that take into account the concerns of stakeholders in the US. 
 Government and business leaders need to make the case that any agreement will benefit not just a few large multinational corporations, but also small and medium-sized businesses, consumers and workers, she said.
 The US has to make a special effort to try talking once again about trade agreements, but make a case for these from the outset and not negotiate behind closed doors, she added.

Washington faces risks in S-E Asia as Gaza war stirs anti-US sentiments

Body


KUALA LUMPUR/JAKARTA/WASHINGTON  The prolonged conflict in Gaza is deepening antipathy in South-east Asia, especially among its Muslim populations, towards the United States over Washington's unflinching support for Israel.
 This raises questions as to whether governments in the region, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia which have Muslim majorities, will be under pressure to play to the gallery and make a show of slowing down efforts to forge closer ties with the US, said analysts. 
 While countries in the region court stronger economic ties with China, they have also sought closer relations with the US to balance the Asian powerhouse's influence in the region, particularly at a time when Beijing has been increasingly assertive in its disputes in the South China Sea with several Asean nations.
 However, the US "has never been an unequivocally welcomed power in our region", said Professor Joseph Liow, dean of the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences at Nanyang Technological University.
 This is a hangover of things that happened 20 years ago, he said, pointing to America's war on Afghanistan and Iraq in the aftermath of the Sept 11 terrorist attacks in the US in 2001.
 This is "very fresh in the minds of many Malaysians and Indonesians, and I think that script is going to play out again, and that is going to create difficulties for the leaders of these countries", he said at a lecture on Nov 1.
 What is more, "the domestic political configuration today is far more brutal than it was 20 years ago, so that will be particularly tricky", he added.
 Indeed, in Malaysia, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who in his first year in office is battling to reverse waning support from the Malay Muslim majority, is finding he has had to up the rhetoric on the Gaza conflict.
 "American troops are all over the Middle East... giving easy passage to Israel. This has reached the level of insanity to allow people to be butchered. This is the height of barbarism," he said at an Oct 24 rally in Kuala Lumpur in support of Palestinians.
 Still, so far, it has been just talk.
 While taking a hardline stance, the Malaysian government has also sought to explain to foreign governments that this is due to pressure from the Malay Muslim nationalist opposition, official sources told The Straits Times.
 "'Cut me some slack' is the gist of it," a top diplomat said.
 While Jakarta also stands with the Palestinians -- and like Kuala Lumpur, points to Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories as the root cause of the conflict -- it has used less confrontational language. Indonesian President Joko Widodo has called for a resolution along "United Nations parameters".
 There are no significant policy changes so far, as the conflict in Gaza enters its second month and the Palestinian death toll now reaches well above 10,000, since Hamas' unprecedented Oct 7 attack on Israel, killing 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, and taking more than 200 hostages.
 This lack of government action has led to consumers in Malaysia and Indonesia organising boycotts against companies and products, mostly of American origins, deemed -- sometimes mistakenly -- to have ties to Israel. 
 There has been strong organic support for boycotts in both countries, with some Starbucks and McDonald's outlets around Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta seeing a marked drop in footfall. There have even been protests outside American restaurant chains. 
 But the Indonesian government has distanced itself from these initiatives. 
 "Our priority has always been carrying out policies that support the productivity and competitiveness of our industry," the Industry Ministry's most senior bureaucrat, secretary-general Putu Juli Ardika, said on Nov 2, adding that the government is neither in support of nor in opposition to such boycotts.
 However, both Datuk Seri Anwar and Mr Widodo are expected to raise the Gaza issue at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders' Week 2023 taking place in the US from Saturday.
 Mr Widodo, who has secured a bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden, is widely expected to push his counterpart to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
 While the Biden administration remains firmly supportive of Israel, there are divisions within Congress and in the State Department over that position. Some State Department staff have critiqued the administration's handling of the war in an internal dissent memo, with a Politico report stating that they argued, among other things, that the US should be willing to publicly criticise Israel.
 This comes as pressure grows in Muslim societies, within and beyond the US, to rein in Israel.
 Dr Prashanth Parameswaran, a fellow at the Wilson Centre, a Washington think-tank -- and founder of the Asean Wonk newsletter -- told The Straits Times that "if the Biden administration doesn't carefully thread the needle between its support for Israel and addressing the Palestinian plight, Washington risks losing the street in Muslim South-east Asia which could, in turn, complicate public aspects of its cooperation with governments".
 Despite differences over the war, strategically, the US' relations with countries in South-east Asia are unlikely to suffer long-term derailment, said the Centre for Strategic and International Studies' South-east Asia programme director Gregory Poling. 
 "It's inevitable that this will create some backlash and resentment towards the US, particularly in Malaysia and in parts of Indonesia," he said. "But what's not clear yet is how deep and long-lasting that will be.
 "It's pretty clear that elites in both countries, but especially in Indonesia, want to maintain positive relations with the US, while they have to maintain a balance on the Israel-Palestine question."
 Former transport minister and Malaysian Chinese Association president Ong Tee Keat, who now heads the Belt and Road Initiative Caucus for Asia-Pacific, told ST that "any political leader will be aware of sentiment on the ground, but foreign policy changes are a matter of a variety of factors, although it can become unpredictable when politics comes into it". 
 What some fear is that the refusal of Muslim leaders in the region to condemn Hamas could spur militancy, with hundreds having previously joined the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and Syria's uprising against the Bashar al-Assad regime.
 Professor Zachary Abuza, an expert on South-east Asian security at the National War College in Washington, warned of a "revitalisation of terror networks, renewed terror attacks, radicalisation and fund-raising for militant groups" as the war in Gaza continues, serving as "a catalyst for... disparate jihadist groups in South-east Asia that are seeking both a cause and charismatic leader to rally around".
 In part, the Hamas International Financing Prevention Bill to impose sanctions with respect to foreign support for Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which was passed by the House of Representatives, is the US' attempt to stifle such a development.
 Although it still needs to be given the green light by the Senate as well as President Biden, concerns are already growing in Malaysia, where Mr Anwar has insisted that such unilateral sanctions will not be recognised.
 Nonetheless, he acknowledged that it could impact trade and, more importantly, investment ties with the US, which contributed more than half of the RM75 billion (S$21.7 billion) net foreign direct investment inflow in 2022.
 Ms Ariel Tan, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies and coordinator of the Malaysia programme, told ST, however, that even if the Bill becomes law, the impact would depend on what constitutes "support", for what activities, what specific US assistance to Malaysia would be at stake, and if the US would seek a waiver for Malaysia due to considerations of national security interests. 
 "Malaysia, like many Muslim-majority countries, is a significant source of private fund-raising for humanitarian and development purposes in the Palestinian territories. It is almost impossible to account for all the sources and destinations of these funds. While PM Anwar is unlikely to withdraw his political and moral support for Hamas for now, his government would have to consider how it relates to Hamas, and provide support for the Palestinians under changed circumstances in Gaza as well as US law," she said.
 Former foreign minister Saifuddin Abdullah, who is now an opposition lawmaker, has openly said Malaysia hosts a cultural society organisation belonging to Hamas and "we are not apologetic about it".
 Mr Anwar's preparedness to face the music might also be down to warming ties with China, with two visits in six months yielding hundreds of billions in deals.  
 But what is clear is his need to keep Malaysia's distance from the US, at least publicly, to assuage public sentiments at a time when he needs to keep Muslim-majority voters onside in order to see out his first term and perhaps win a second.
 Datuk Seri Saifuddin told ST: "Anwar seems to have to do extra work to dispel the image that he is pro-US. But in foreign policy, we have to be very measured in our choice of words and language. Since he became prime minister, he seems to be very loose."

Hard truths about Gaza war's cruel and complex dilemmas

Body


The horrific terrorist attack of Oct 7, which saw 1,400 mainly civilian Israelis murdered, and the consequent response against Hamas in Gaza that resulted in thousands of civilian Palestinian collateral casualties, has aroused strong emotions among Singaporeans.
 To empathise is only human. Emotions are amplified by the complexity of the Palestinian issue. From that long and tangled history, narratives that lay all responsibility on one side or the other can be easily constructed to fan emotions.
 But Palestine is not a morality tale of clear right or wrong. Narratives are not analyses and emotions are not interests. Rather than futilely trying to apportion responsibility, we should instead look to our interests. 
 Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan's speech in Parliament on Nov 6 is a good starting point. It restated the principles underlying Singapore's longstanding positions on Palestine. In the current context, five points are of particular importance:
 The last point is clearly the most important to Singapore.
 Only days before the terrorist attack on Israel, on Oct 4, I attended a Sukkot celebration -- one of the main Jewish festivals -- at the Maghain Aboth Synagogue in Waterloo Street, the oldest existing synagogue in Singapore dating from 1878. Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, patron of the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO), was guest of honour.
 The celebration was attended not just by the Rabbi, but also by the Mufti of Singapore and religious leaders of all faiths -- Buddhist, Taoist, Hindu, Sikh, Christians of different denominations, Zoroastrians and Bahai -- from the IRO.
 This was unique. Such an event would not -- could not -- have been held anywhere else in South-east Asia. I doubt that anything like it was likely to be held anywhere else in the world.
 This is what makes Singapore, Singapore. Whatever our individual opinions about Oct 7 and its aftermath, this is something precious to be preserved at all costs. Singaporeans of all faiths should rally around the five principles I have summarised.
 But defence of our uniqueness from the raw emotions evoked by the war in Gaza also requires a deeper understanding than can be conveyed by any ministerial speech.
 Principles are necessarily simplifications of far more complex, and at times harsh, realities. No government, out of diplomatic prudence if nothing else, can publicly say everything that needs to be said about balancing conflicting considerations and the complicated processes in which principles must be contextualised in order to become policy.
 Singaporeans should not dismiss the depth of the trauma inflicted by the barbarism of the Oct 7 attack: not just murder, but also rape, torture, mutilation, including of infants, in some instances captured on videos by cameras of killed terrorists. This cannot be justified by any reason.
 Documents captured from dead terrorists make clear that their orders were to kill as many people as possible and not any military objective. Israel is a small country and few Israelis would be at more than one degree of separation from those murdered or taken hostage.
 Justified anger at atrocities does not, of course, justify committing atrocities in turn. The ministerial speech cautioned that "it is crucial that decisions are not made out of anger, blind wrath and hatred". That is obvious and I don't think the Israeli government will do so even if some Israeli political figures speak wildly and thoughtlessly. But it is equally crucial that Singaporeans understand Israel's war aims.
 Why deterrence mattersThis is certainly not a war of revenge. To say that Israel is exercising its inherent right to self-defence, while true and important, begs the really crucial question: To what specific end is Israel exercising that right'
 The answer is to restore deterrence. The importance of this cannot be overemphasised.
 On Oct 7, Israeli deterrence against Hamas clearly failed. Israel must restore deterrence against Hamas and whatever may replace it in Gaza after its current leadership is destroyed. More vitally, Israel must restore deterrence against Iran and Hezbollah and other terrorist groups that Teheran supports. 
 Restoring deterrence is an existential issue for Israel. Deterrence based on military superiority is one of the pillars on which Israel's right to exist has rested from its very foundation.
 In 1947, United Nations Resolution 181 proposed a two-state solution for Palestine. After some hesitation, the Jews then living under the British mandate in Palestine accepted the UN plan, while the Arabs did not. On May 14, 1948, Israel declared independence. The very next day, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon attacked Israel, with Saudi Arabia and Yemen sending troops under Egyptian command. Jordan subsequently joined the war.
 Israel survived the 1948 war. But it took two more lost wars against Israel in 1967 and 1973 before the Arab states faced reality and recognised de facto, if not immediately de jure, Israel's right to exist.
 Egypt recognised Israel in 1979; Jordan followed in 1994. In 2020, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan recognised Israel under the Abraham Accords.
 Over the last decade or longer, most Gulf states have established some degree of informal contact and cooperation with Israel. This includes Saudi Arabia, which has been negotiating with the United States to normalise relations with Israel in return for security guarantees and help with its civilian nuclear programme. 
 Syria and Lebanon are technically still at war with Israel. But Syria is a failed state not in full control of its own territory; and in 2022, Lebanon signed a maritime boundary agreement over the Mediterranean gas fields with Israel.
 By contrast, the destruction of Israel is written into Hamas' founding documents. About a fortnight after the Oct 7 attack, senior Hamas leader Ghazi Hamad vowed that Hamas would repeat attacks "again and again" to "remove" Israel. Asked if that meant the annihilation of Israel, he replied with chilling simplicity: "Yes, of course." 
 Iranian leaders often make similar statements. There is little reason not to take them at their word.
 Under these circumstances and with the restoration of deterrence as an existential issue, humanitarian law and the laws of war take on a somewhat abstract quality as counsels of perfection. Nevertheless, I think Israel, in order to retain the support of the US and key European countries, will respect humanitarian law and the laws of war to the extent that it is practical.
 That last phrase -- to the extent practical -- is key. I do not think Israel deliberately targets civilians as civilians. But Hamas wears no uniforms and routinely deploys and operates its military assets in, under and near civilian infrastructure. To Hamas, civilian casualties are only another weapon to delegitimise Israel's right to self-defence.
 Israel faces a wicked dilemma (I use "wicked" in the sense of a problem that is impossible to solve because of its complexity). Acting too gingerly risks allowing deterrence to further erode. This is absolutely unacceptable. Its previous policy of containing Hamas within Gaza having failed, Israel has announced its intention to eradicate the Hamas leadership to deter whatever will take its place from similar terrorist acts. But doing so will and has resulted in large-scale collateral civilian deaths.
 Terrorist threatCivilian deaths are always to be deplored. But it is in nobody's interest if terrorists anywhere are encouraged by the Hamas attack on Israel and come to believe that they can avoid retribution by adopting similar tactics.
 The ministerial speech made clear that Singapore's strong stance against terrorism was not just out of sympathy for victims in other countries, but because "terrorism is a clear and present threat for Singapore too". 
 In 2016, only two years after Israel launched Operation Protective Edge against Hamas to stop rocket attacks from Gaza, a plot by a terrorist group to fire rockets at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore from Batam was foiled with the help of the Indonesian authorities.
 Hamas has a significant presence in Malaysia. Malaysian leaders have met Hamas leaders. Although it denies it, the Palestinian Cultural Organisation Malaysia has often been described as a representative office for Hamas. After Oct 7, there were demonstrations in support of Hamas and to celebrate its so-called "victory". A Malaysian school even encouraged children to brandish toy guns to celebrate solidarity with Palestine. 
 Fortunately, even Singaporeans who feel strongly about Palestine have not gone as far as celebrating violence and I hope they never will. Still, in the past three years, two Singaporeans have been dealt with under the Internal Security Act for wanting to travel to Gaza to fight alongside Hamas.
 As a thought experiment, imagine how we should respond if, some time in the future, terrorists operating from urban areas in Johor fire rockets at Housing Board flats in northern Singapore or try to shoot down aircraft taking off and landing at Changi Airport? Given the direction in which Malaysian politics is drifting, can we always rely on the Malaysian authorities to stop them? 
 Two-state solution In the long run, Israel's security must, as the ministerial speech made clear, rest on a comprehensive political settlement based on a two-state solution. This is obviously true. The problem is that there is no obvious viable pathway to such a solution.
 UN Security Council Resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) mentioned in the ministerial speech refer directly or indirectly to a just and lasting peace being based on Israel's withdrawal from occupied territories. But both resolutions are silent on how this is to be achieved.
 The Middle East is a region where there are seldom any good options; only bad options and worse options. The Palestinian issue is where the dilemmas are sharpest.
 The cruel paradox facing Israel and the Palestinians is that any political settlement must rest on a foundation of stability; stability rests on strong deterrence; but after Oct 7, what Israel needs to do to restore stability through deterrence will make any pathway to a settlement even more difficult, at least for the foreseeable future.
 It is not to be taken for granted that the Israeli hard right, Fatah on the West Bank, and Hamas in Gaza really want a two-state solution. Some level of conflict suits them best. All remain in power by manipulating the Palestinian issue in a tacit conspiracy in which ordinary Palestinians pay the cost.
 Is Fatah in deep mourning because the Hamas leadership is being targeted by Israel? In 2007, Hamas seized Gaza in a coup in which many Fatah officials were brutally murdered.
 Whether Fatah or Hamas, full sovereignty means full responsibility. A few years ago, I visited the West Bank to meet a Palestinian friend who had been a senior member of the Palestinian Authority (PA) but had just resigned. Why, I asked? We have failed in both the struggle and in governance, he replied.
 With full sovereignty, Palestine will cease to be an international cause celebre and become just another corrupt and badly governed Third World state. Without the excuse of Israeli pressure, international sympathy and aid will soon dry up.
 Even if Fatah replaces Hamas in Gaza after the war, this hard reality will not change. Fatah will have to quickly learn to govern honestly and competently. I do not say that this is impossible, but it certainly goes against the grain of Fatah's dismal record on the West Bank since the PA was established in 1994.
 I doubt that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-right government will survive Oct 7. But even if it is replaced by a more centrist government, we should not assume Israeli support for a two-state solution. I have been struck by how Oct 7 has tilted political attitudes among my Israeli friends, particularly those who had been left-inclined and supportive of a two-state solution. We can only hope that this is not a permanent condition.
 Palestinian pawn in regional politics Finally, Singaporeans should understand the broader geopolitical context of the Palestinian issue. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq and the destruction of Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime were a strategic blunder that destroyed the only regional balance to Iran. This created a fundamental geopolitical instability in the heart of the Middle East. Ever since, dealing with this imbalance and not Palestine has been the primary strategic concern of most Sunni Arab governments, particularly the Gulf monarchies, with the partial exceptions of Qatar and Oman.
 After three failed wars against Israel, and with Egypt and Jordan recognising Israel, enthusiasm for the Palestinian cause among most Arab governments had, in any case, waned as they increasingly looked to their own national interests. The 2011 Arab Spring protests turned the attention of the Gulf monarchies even further inwards towards the far more crucial issue of regime survival. The 2020 Abraham Accords marked the formal marginalisation of the Palestinian issue.
 For Iran, Palestine is mainly a means to pressure Israel and embarrass Sunni Arab governments.
 The Palestinians know all this. The Oct 7 terrorist attack and earlier smaller-scale attacks on Israel were attempts by Hamas and similar groups to check this process of marginalisation. The Oct 7 attack -- triggered by faster-than-expected progress in the talks on Saudi normalisation of ties with Israel -- did succeed in putting the Palestinian cause back in centre stage -- for now. Its effect is likely to be only temporary.
 The Abraham Accords are, in effect, a US-sponsored anti-Iran coalition in which Israel provides military heft and the US overall deterrence against Iran as an offshore balancer, seen most recently in the deployment of two US aircraft carriers and a nuclear submarine to the region. Since the geopolitical conditions that led to the Abraham Accords have not changed, sooner or later, the process of Saudi-Israel normalisation will resume, delayed but not diverted by Oct 7.
 Hamas is an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, which is anathema to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and most Gulf monarchies and the Egyptian military. I doubt anyone in Riyadh, Abu Dhabi or Cairo is losing much sleep over the eradication of the Hamas leadership. No country has left the Abraham Accords over Gaza. The civilian casualties are mainly a domestic political problem that these governments must manage and their statements and positions in the UN should be seen in this light.
 At the time of writing -- Nov 8, 2023 -- it does not seem likely that the current conflict in Gaza will escalate into a wider regional war. Exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel on the northern front have caused relatively few casualties on both sides and Hezbollah seems more interested in showing solidarity with Hamas than providing real support. Iran has enough internal troubles to want to add to them by provoking a major war in which it cannot remain uninvolved. I am convinced that sooner or later, there will be a major war in the Middle East. But that big war will be fought over Iran's nuclear capability and not Palestine, which is simply not important enough to any of the major players.

Support for pro-Israel Biden nosedives among Arab Americans

Byline: Nirmal Ghosh US, Support for pro-Israel Biden nosedives among Arab Americans
Body


WASHINGTON  The image of his emotional hug with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Oct 18 will not only haunt, but probably also outlive United States President Joe Biden as a defining moment of his presidency. 
 The president's seemingly unqualified support for Israel has collapsed his backing among a section of the electorate that has for decades reliably voted Democrat -- Arab Americans. With margins as thin as a few thousand votes in just a few crucial swing states, that may well crash his 2024 bid for another term in office.
 "We feel betrayed," a former Barack Obama administration official, an Arab American who declined to be named, told The Straits Times.
 "There's no other word for it; it's a betrayal." 
 A poll of 500 Arab Americans between Oct 23 and 27 found that the community's support for Mr Biden has plummeted from 59 per cent to 17 per cent -- a precipitous 42 percentage point decrease from 2020. 
 There are an estimated 3.7 million Americans of Arab descent.
 The survey by political polling firm John Zogby Strategies asked respondents whom they would vote for if the election for president of the US were held today.
 Of those surveyed, 17 per cent said they would vote for Mr Biden, and 40 per cent said they would vote for Donald Trump -- the beleaguered former president and still presumptive Republican nominee for 2024. 
 The poll was commissioned by the Arab American Institute (AAI), a civic engagement organisation that conducts political and policy research. 
 "Outcomes in very hotly contested delegate-rich swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Virginia can be determined by margins of only a few hundred or thousands of votes, where the Arab-American vote can be the difference," Mr John Zogby, senior partner at John Zogby Strategies, told The Straits Times. 
 The Arab-American community is not a homogenous bloc, but the prevailing opinion of Mr Biden cut across the population, said Mr James Zogby, president and founder of the AAI. 
 Mr John Zogby is his brother. 
 "It didn't matter which component group, whether the country of origin was Lebanon or Egypt or Palestine or whatever," Mr James Zogby said in a Zoom discussion on the poll.
 "The entire community was dramatically impacted and the drop in attitudes was... precipitous."
 In 2008 and 2016, Democrat-identifying Arab Americans outnumbered those identifying as Republican by two to one, AAI said. 
 But in this recent poll, 32 per cent of Arab Americans identified as Republican, as opposed to just 23 per cent who identified as Democrats. 
 "It's not so much that they are not going to be Democrats any more, but that they, at this point, just don't want to identify with the party of the president, and the party that's handling this (the war)," Mr James Zogby said.
 Arab immigrants began arriving in the US in sizeable numbers more than 100 years ago and live across the country, with more than two-thirds residing in just 10 states: California, Michigan, New York, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.
 A third of Arab Americans live in Los Angeles, New York and Detroit; more than 300,000 live in the latter, which is Michigan's largest city. 
 In 2020, Mr Biden won Michigan with a margin of just 154,188 votes. His winning margin in Pennsylvania was 81,660. 
 A separate poll of 513 registered voters in Michigan, conducted by one of Mr Biden's former pollsters, Lake Research Partners, over Oct 30 to Nov 2, found that only 16 per cent of Arab and Muslim Democrats surveyed said they would vote for Mr Biden if the election were held today. 
 The AAI-commissioned poll showed a strong majority of Arab Americans -- 68 per cent -- believe that the US should use its influence to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
 Sixty-seven per cent disapprove of the president's handling of the crisis, and 68 per cent believe the US should not send weapons and military supplies to Israel.
 The poll showed high levels of concern for personal safety as well -- for their own Arab-American communities and also for Jewish people.  
 The high levels of support for Palestinian rights, and high negatives for the president's policies, are shared by every demographic subgroup covered in the poll -- by age, gender, education level, religion, or whether immigrant or native born, the AAI said.
 The former Obama administration official who spoke to ST on condition of anonymity said: "I think the betrayal comes at two levels." 
 The person added: "One is the very visceral level -- that people who look like us, who speak the language we speak, who share our religion or our last names or our first names are not valued as much as Israeli lives or even Jewish lives." 
 That the president had mentioned the threat of anti-Semitism but not Islamophobia in the first few days of the conflict, and his casting doubt on the numbers of people reportedly killed in Gaza, was seen as "utterly disrespectful and inhumane and very dehumanising", the former official said.
 The White House on Nov 1 announced that it would work on a plan to combat Islamophobia, but the reception to that has been lukewarm at best. 
 No details have emerged, and the announcement itself was delayed, the Associated Press reported, citing concerns from Muslim Americans that the administration lacked credibility on the issue given its robust backing of Israel's military, whose strikes have killed more than 10,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians and many of them children.
 Former State Department Middle East policy expert Wa'el Alzayat, now chief executive of Emgage Foundation, a civic education and engagement organisation for Muslim Americans, told CNN on Nov 3: "What we're seeing right now is not just greatly disappointing, but outright horrifying; that the administration that we helped turn out the vote for is refusing to call for a ceasefire." 
 The former Obama administration official said that from a policy perspective as well, there is pain and anger among Arab Americans.
 "Arab Americans are Americans. So we care about America. We care about American standing in the world, and we care about America's moral compass in the world; and to see all of that just being destroyed is a betrayal on a very different level than just personally," the person added. 
 "Watching the destruction of an entire people, which you are sort of complicit in, is making sure that peace is becoming harder and harder and harder to achieve in the long term," the former official said.

First Filipinos to be evacuated from Gaza worry about kin

Byline: Mara Cepeda, First Filipinos to be evacuated from Gaza worry about kin
Body


MANILA  The first batch of 34 Filipinos evacuated from Gaza arrived in the Philippines on Friday evening, relieved but also heartbroken at having to leave their Palestinian kin behind.
 President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said there were 137 Filipinos in the Gaza Strip before Oct 7, when Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its attack on Israel.
 By Saturday, at least 78 Filipino nationals in Gaza had crossed the Rafah border into Egypt, where the Philippine government has been working to secure their flights back to Manila from Cairo.
 The remainder, 59 of them, have decided to stay in Gaza as their Palestinian relatives have not been allowed to leave. 
 One Palestinian spouse of a Filipino evacuee, however, was able to obtain clearance to join those repatriated to Manila. It is unclear what criteria have to be met for both the Israeli and Egyptian governments to allow the Filipinos' Palestinian relatives to travel with them out of Gaza.
 Most of the Filipino nationals in Gaza first worked in different parts of the Middle East before meeting their Palestinian spouses and eventually settling in the coastal strip.
 Since 2012, Filipino nurse Lucina Al-Qadiri, 57, has been living in Gaza, where her five adult children have completed their studies. Her Palestinian husband is also a nurse, but is based in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. 
 Mrs Al-Qadiri and all her children except her eldest son were evacuated from Gaza. She could not fight back tears as she told reporters how he had decided to stay behind for now as his Palestinian wife, who had given birth just a day before Oct 7, was not given the green light to travel to Manila.
 Mrs Al-Qadiri's eldest son and grandchild would otherwise have been among the first batch of repatriates. "It's very unfair because she's a breastfeeding mother. She's depressed. Can you really leave her alone there? It was so inhumane that she couldn't go with us".
 Mrs Al-Qadiri said she and her daughter-in-law could not bear the thought of their loved ones being killed by an Israeli missile strike. So Mrs Al-Qadiri reached out to Philippine embassy officials in Jordan for help.
 "I told them to take us out of Gaza. I would have been okay, but I was worried about my children. If I see their dead bodies, I wouldn't be able to take it," she said. 
 Mrs Minerva Sabah, 58, also cried when she told reporters that her Palestinian husband, an assistant professor in Gaza, could not flee with her and their two adult children to the Philippines. Mrs Sabah said she was not sure when they would see him again. 
 "I have been through six wars. I was repatriated in 2008, again in 2014, but this is the worst one yet. Right now, our house in Gaza is still standing, but I don't know if it will still be there when we return," she said as tears streamed down her face. 
 The Philippine government has given each repatriated family from Gaza about 76,000 pesos (S$1,800) in cash as well as transport and accommodation assistance.
 A second batch of 42 repatriated Filipinos from Gaza was still in Cairo and expected to travel to Manila soon. Two Filipino members of Doctors Without Borders were among the first foreigners to leave Gaza on Nov 2. The Philippines has also been repatriating Filipino migrant workers stuck in Israel. 
 By Tuesday, Manila had evacuated 184 Filipino migrant workers who mostly worked as caregivers, along with seven infants. There are still about 30,000 Filipinos in Israel, according to the Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs. 
 The future remains uncertain for the Filipinos repatriated from Gaza, who have seen how Israeli air and artillery strikes have flattened large swathes of the place they used to call home. 
 "Whenever Israel started bombing, it was really intense. Gaza is gone. They pulverised it," said Mrs Isabelita Balala, a 62-year-old caregiver who has worked in Gaza for the past two decades. "Whenever the bombing got closer to us, we didn't know if we would survive."
 Palestinian officials said on Friday that more than 11,000 Gaza residents have been killed since Israel began its daily bombardment. Israel said on the same day that the Israeli death toll is 1,200, revised down from the previous estimate of 1,400.
 Referring to the Israeli Defence Forces, Mrs Al-Qadiri said: "They are turning the city and its people to ashes. Everything you've seen on TV is true." She added: "I'll stay in the Philippines for now to give a chance for myself to heal."

Macron urges Israel to stop bombing Gaza and killing civilians

Byline: , Macron urges Israel to stop bombing Gaza and killing civilians
Body


GAZA  Israel must stop bombing Gaza and killing civilians, French President Emmanuel Macron told the BBC in an interview published late on Friday.
 He said there was no justification for the bombing, adding that a ceasefire would benefit Israel.
 Mr Macron said France "clearly condemns" the "terrorist" actions of Hamas. But while recognising Israel's right to protect itself, he said "we do urge them to stop this bombing" in Gaza.
 He is the first leader of a major Western nation to call for a ceasefire, and when asked if he wanted other leaders -- including in the United States and Britain -- to join his calls, Mr Macron said: "I hope they will."
 World leaders have said Israel needs to do more to protect Palestinian civilians as it attempts to flush out Hamas from the Gaza Strip.
 Fighting has intensified between Israeli forces and the group's fighters near and around hospitals in the enclave.
 More than 11,000 people have been killed in Gaza in five weeks of fighting, according to the enclave's health officials.
 The war is in response to an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on Oct 7. Israel says around 1,200 people were killed, a revision of an earlier death toll of some 1,400. More than 240 people were also taken hostage.
 Israel says Hamas would exploit a truce to regroup. In his response to Mr Macron's call for a ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said world leaders should be condemning Hamas, not Israel. 
 "These crimes that Hamas (is) committing today in Gaza will be committed tomorrow in Paris, New York and anywhere in the world," Mr Netanyahu said.
 In Riyadh, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said on Saturday that Palestinians are facing an "unmatched genocidal war". 
 He called on the US to pressure Israel into halting its offensive on Gaza.
 Speaking during an extraordinary joint Islamic-Arab summit in the Saudi capital, Mr Abbas also said Palestinians needed international protection in the face of Israeli attacks. 
 At the same summit, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Israel bears responsibility for what he called "crimes committed against Palestinian people". He also called for an end to the siege of the Gaza Strip. In addition, the Crown Prince called for the immediate end of military operations and the release of hostages.
 Dozens of leaders, including Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, attended the summit.
 As he headed to Riyadh on Saturday, he said the time had come for action over the conflict rather than talk.
 "Gaza is not an arena for words. It should be for action," Mr Raisi said at Teheran airport before departing. "Today, the unity of the Islamic countries is very important," he added.
 But divisions remain among the nations in the Middle East and North Africa.
 Foreign ministers from the region held an emergency meeting on Thursday to prepare for the summit. Some countries, led by Algeria, called to cut all diplomatic ties with Israel, two delegates said.
 But a bloc of Arab countries, which have established diplomatic relations with Israel, pushed back, the delegates said. These countries stressed the need to keep channels open with the Israeli government. 
 In Gaza, a baby died in an incubator at the Al Shifa hospital, the largest such facility in the enclave, after it lost power on Saturday. 
 A person in intensive care was also killed by an Israeli shell, a spokesman for the Palestinian Health Ministry said.
 "The situation is worse than anyone can imagine. We are besieged inside the Al Shifa Medical Complex, and the occupation has targeted most of the buildings inside," said Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra.
 Residents said Israeli forces had been fighting Hamas gunmen all night in and around Gaza City, where the hospital is located.
 The Israeli military says Hamas militants have placed command centres under Al Shifa hospital and other such facilities in Gaza, making them vulnerable to being considered military targets.
 "The hospitals need to be evacuated in order to deal with Hamas. We intend on dealing with Hamas who have turned hospitals into fortified positions," the military said, in response to the question of whether it planned to enter Gaza hospitals at some point.
 Hamas has denied using civilians as human shields. 
 Health officials say the growing number of Israeli strikes on or near hospitals put patients, medical staff and thousands of evacuees who have taken shelter in and near their buildings at risk.
 Mr Qidra said Israeli army snipers commandeering rooftops of buildings near the hospital fired into the medical complex from time to time, limiting the ability of medics and people to move.
 The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
 The hospital suspended operations after fuel ran out, Mr Al-Qidra said, adding: "As a result, one newborn baby died inside the incubator."
 The Palestinian Health Ministry, which is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank -- separated from Gaza by Israel and run by a rival administration to Hamas -- said separately that 39 babies were at risk at the hospital.
 Minister Mai Al-Kaila had initially said they had died because they could not be given oxygen or medicine, and electricity was cut off. 
 But the ministry later corrected the information to say that one had died and 39 were at risk. REUTERS

As the Gaza war rages, Israel faces a critical question about its future

Byline: Jonathan Eyal Global, As the Gaza war rages, Israel faces a critical question about its future
Body


As Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza enters its sixth week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep up his military offensive regardless of international pressure to stop the bloodshed. Israel, he told a press conference at the start of the week, will be standing "firm against the world, if necessary". 
 True to form, Mr Netanyahu also used his latest meetings with the media to defend himself against accusations of responsibility for Israel's failure to prevent the Oct 7 attack, in which Hamas slaughtered more than 1,000 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians, and abducted some 240.
 The Israeli leader compared himself to former US president Franklin Roosevelt, who failed to anticipate the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. "Did people ask Franklin Roosevelt, after Pearl Harbor, that question (of responsibility)'" Mr Netanyahu snapped at a CNN reporter.
 Mr Netanyahu's readiness to mix his country's war aims with personal justifications is hardly surprising: He has spent his entire political life believing that his interests are indistinguishable from those of the Jewish state.
 Still, the fact remains that the current war is not only a mighty confrontation between Israel and its deadliest Palestinian enemy, but also a battle for Israel's future political destiny.
 A critical choice Despite all his excuses and explanations, chances are high that Mr Netanyahu's career will soon end. The real question is whether he would be replaced by a government more determined to reach political accommodation with the Palestinians or whether Israel will be ruled by people condemning the Jewish state to further decades of bloodshed. 
 The psychological shock Hamas inflicted on Israeli society is often compared to that suffered by the United States after the Sept 11, 2001, terror attacks. Yet, the comparison fails to account for history.
 The whole justification for the creation of the state of Israel just a few years after the Holocaust was to provide a home for the Jews, a place where they'd feel safe. The Hamas attack does not directly threaten Israel's existence. However, by murdering in one single blow the most significant number of Jews since World War II, Hamas has challenged Israel's founding principle. As a senior Israeli official told me a few days ago: "If Jews cannot be safe in Israel, then why not continue living in Paris or Brooklyn'"
 Hamas has undertaken its murderous actions precisely because it hopes for the destruction of the Jewish state. And most Israelis share the perception that Hamas is their mortal foe. Thus, Israel's entire political class shares Prime Minister Netanyahu's objective of "destroying" Hamas.
 Yet this is very different from arguing -- as some of Mr Netanyahu's supporters now do -- that the Prime Minister remains the unchallenged war leader and is likely to emerge as Israel's war hero. Neither proposition is true.
 Whether Israel's supposedly legendary intelligence services failed to pick up warning signs about Hamas' preparations for the October attack remains a matter for a future committee of inquiry, which will be established in Israel when the fighting stops. Yet there is already a strong strand of opinion that the chief culprit remains the Prime Minister, partly because, as US politicians like to say, "the buck stops with him", but also because his culpability is pretty evident.
 Since he returned to office last December, Mr Netanyahu has spent most of his time trying to curtail the powers of his country's judges in a vain effort to escape conviction on corruption charges. That paralysed the nation in a series of unprecedented mass demonstrations.
 It would be surprising if Hamas did not interpret this as a sign of Israeli weakness and as an invitation to strike. Israel's intelligence services explicitly warned the government; Mr Netanyahu will struggle to explain why he ignored such warnings.
 The Israeli Premier also did nothing while his ministers provoked Palestinians in the West Bank, by violating Islam's holiest places and by paying no heed to the violence meted out against Palestinians by illegal Jewish settlers on occupied Palestinian land. Mr Netanyahu also encouraged the rivalry between Hamas, which rules Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority, the internationally recognised government of the Palestinians.
 Mr Netanyahu is a master survivor, but this time, opinion polls show his legendary political manoeuvring skills may not be enough. 
 The latest nationwide Israel opinion survey released last week suggests that 44 per cent of respondents blame Mr Netanyahu for failing to avert the Hamas attack, followed by 33 per cent who blame top military officials for the failure. More significantly, 47 per cent of the Israeli public want Mr Netanyahu to resign at the end of the war, and a further third want him to leave immediately. Over two-thirds of respondents expect early elections soon after the war is over.
 Golda Meir, the leader of the centre-left Labour Party, was forced to resign soon after the Yom Kippur war of 1973, in similar circumstances: she presided over an intelligence failure. Menachem Begin, the leader of the centre-right Likud (Mr Netanyahu's party), was driven out of office in the early 1980s after he got bogged down in an endless war with Lebanon.
 Both former Israeli prime ministers enjoyed large parliamentary majorities; Mr Netanyahu, whose party currently has only a quarter of the parliamentary seats, can hardly expect a better fate.
 Hard-right ministersThe fear among foreign diplomats and political observers in Israel is that Mr Netanyahu would either prolong or expand the Gaza war in his desperation to cling to power. The worst offenders in this regard are ministers from the governing coalition's two far-right parties, Mr Bezalel Smotrich, the Finance Minister who runs the Religious Zionist Party, and Mr Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is Mr Netanyahu's security minister and leads Otzma Yehudit, an even more extreme right-wing movement.
 Earlier in 2023, Mr Smotrich claimed that there is "no such thing" as the Palestinian people and predicted long before the Hamas attack that "the time will probably come" for Israel "to reconquer Gaza". Mr Netanyahu now seems to be adopting this approach by claiming that Israel would maintain "security responsibility" over Gaza for an indefinite period.
 And if this was not bad enough, a minister from the Otzma Yehudit party recently suggested that dropping a nuclear bomb in Gaza was "one way" to bring an end to the war. So, there is no shortage of extremists in the current government keen to expand the cycle of violence.
 Still, it's essential to recall that, uniquely in Israel's history, the Netanyahu government is facing street demonstrations in the middle of a war and knows that its reputation is in tatters.
 The only reason the protests remain relatively muted is that former defence minister Benny Gantz and members of his centrist opposition party have joined his coalition for the duration of the war, on condition that many of Mr Netanyahu's extremist Cabinet ministers are kept out of the much smaller "war Cabinet" that makes operational decisions.
 What if Mr Netanyahu starts diverting the war for his own personal political reasons? In that case, chances are high that Mr Gantz will resign from government, and this would be a mortal blow to the Prime Minister's political survival chances because it will immediately face the return of substantial street demonstrations it won't be able to quell or ignore.
 It is also fanciful to suggest that Israel will remain in occupation of Gaza for years, as Mr Netanyahu currently appears to contemplate. The Israelis gave up control of the territory in 2005 precisely because running it became untenable; the task is even worse now, with half of the population internally displaced and about a quarter of all housing destroyed.
 And it is equally far-fetched to suggest that Israel would start a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon without at least an indirect nod from Washington. Despite his characteristic bluster, Mr Netanyahu's room for manoeuvre is limited. It's difficult to see how he can avoid early polls in 2024 and get re-elected: current opinion polls indicate that his present coalition may get not more than 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the votes.
 The electorateWhat will follow Mr Netanyahu's departure? Pessimists suggest that the far-right nationalist and extremist nationalist parties won't go away, and that the alternative could be even worse. Perhaps, but that is far from being a foregone conclusion.
 The Israeli electorate is evenly divided between left and right, and much depends on circumstances: in 2022's elections, for instance, if 20,000 votes out of a population of 9.3 million voted differently, Mr Netanyahu would not have been in power.
 And if, at the next election, voter turnout returns to the more normal 80 per cent instead of just under 70 per cent, the outcome could be entirely different. It should not be forgotten that the current Israeli government is a historic aberration; one of its Cabinet members was once considered so extreme he was prevented from even doing national service in the military. Another was kept to a shortened, non-combat role. It's not apparent that such characters represent Israel's destiny.
 Would a future Israeli government be more amenable to a political settlement with the Arabs? Given the current bloodshed and emotions, chances don't look great. And given the paralysis inside the discredited Palestinian Authority, it's difficult to see who can represent the Palestinians even if the Israelis were prepared to talk.
 The optionsNonetheless, the requirement to restart political dialogue is evident and urgent. For although Mr Netanyahu refuses to admit it, Israel needs someone to take over Gaza when the fighting stops. Without this, any claim that Israel makes for the destruction of Hamas will be negated if, the moment the Israeli troops withdraw, the Hamas flag flies again over the ruins of Gaza City.
 And unless the Israelis start talking to the Palestinian Authority and rein in their slow-motion annexation of occupied Palestinian land, they will discover that the Israeli military will spend most of its time and resources seeking to protect Jewish settlers in the West Bank while the residents of Israel proper suffer from the fury of the Palestinians and other Arab neighbours.
 The only alternative to a two-state solution is the emergence of one state, which won't ultimately be either Jewish or peaceful.

Trade, Gaza on the cards as PM Lee leaves for Apec summit

SAN FRANCISCO Amid stalling global growth, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will join fellow leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum this week to discuss ways to revive trade, shore up supply chains and boost prospects for a sustainable and equitable future. 
 The annual meeting of the grouping's 21 member economies will also feature several highly anticipated meetings on the sidelines, including one between United States President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, as they try to find common ground amid heightening geopolitical rivalry between their countries.
 In the course of his six-day working visit from Monday, PM Lee will hold bilateral meetings with other leaders converging on San Francisco for the summit, said a statement from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).
 The prime ministers of Australia, Japan and Malaysia as well as the presidents of Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea are among the leaders attending the event. 
 In addition, PM Lee will meet California Governor Gavin Newsom, Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook and other prominent corporate chieftains.
 PM Lee will also launch Enterprise Singapore's San Francisco Overseas Centre, meant to support a growing number of Singapore companies seeking a footing in the world's largest economy, which is exhibiting surprisingly strong growth. 
 Another highlight of PM Lee's trip will be a meeting with Singaporeans residing in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
 He will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, and senior officials from the PMO, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Trade and Industry. 
 During his absence, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong will be Acting Prime Minister, the PMO statement said. 
 Apec members make up around 40 per cent of the world's population, 50 per cent of global trade and 60 per cent of the world's gross domestic product.
 The Nov 11 to 17 event kicked off with preparatory meetings between officials and ministers, before the finale -- the Apec Economic Leaders' Meeting on Thursday and Friday -- during which a joint declaration is expected. 
 Here is a look at what to expect from the summit.
 Will Biden and Xi  break the ice'Only modest progress is expected at what will be the most carefully choreographed encounter between the leaders of the world's two most powerful economies on Wednesday. 
 It will be Mr Xi's first visit to the US since 2017, and only the leaders' second meeting during the Biden presidency. If they agree to restore military ties, inactive since Beijing suspended communication in 2022 to protest against then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, it will count as an achievement. Other possibilities are beefing up travel and people-to-people ties.
 The US is keen to get China's help in resolving an opioid crisis that is a leading cause of death among young Americans. It says large quantities of fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid with a potency 50 times that of heroin, are being produced in China and brought illegally to the US. 
 China, for its part, may seek some assurances from the US on Taiwan, given its anxieties surrounding the self-governed island's presidential election in January.
 US restrictions on technology transfer to China and tensions over Beijing's territorial claims in the South China and East China seas will also be discussed.
 Repairing the fractured ties is critical for the two superpowers, said Professor Yuen Yuen Ang, a Singaporean scholar of US-China relations.
 "For Xi, easing tensions with the US is critical for China's economic recovery," said Prof Ang, the Alfred Chandler Chair of Political Economy at Johns Hopkins University.
 "Biden also feels the need to recalibrate US policy towards China. His administration doesn't want to be 'bundled' with loud, irrationally hawkish voices in Washington, and inadvertently let them set the official tone. 
 "It wants to articulate a vigilant and practical position on China," she said.
 Will there be a joint statement on Gaza? Although not on the official agenda, the month-long Gaza conflict and the 20-month-old war in Ukraine are certain to be discussed among the Apec leaders. 
 Dr Victor Cha, senior vice-president for Asia at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said: "Whether there'll be a statement on these issues remains to be seen. I'm sure it's being worked on, but there are disagreements. What we might see is smaller groupings of like-minded countries that may make statements on this." 
 Among others, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Indonesian President Joko Widodo might make clear their disagreement with Washington on its policy of backing Israel in the conflict and holding back from calling for a ceasefire.
 China's role may be critical, but it is yet to significantly exert its substantial influence on Iran, a key backer of Hamas. The Palestinian militant organisation, which runs Gaza, on Oct 7 launched an attack which took 1,200 Israeli lives. Palestinian officials say more than 11,000 Gaza residents have been killed in air and artillery strikes since Oct 7. 
 The US is likely to seek Chinese help in preventing the conflict from spiralling; their interests in the Middle East are not at cross purposes. As a large oil and gas buyer, China would prefer stability in the zone.
 Will there be a major  trade announcement'The US shift away from championing trade liberalisation has caused a reaction in South-east Asia's export-led economies, which look for better access to the US market. The question is whether a key Biden initiative under way can make up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the ambitious free trade deal spiked by the Trump administration. 
 Mr Biden's two-year-old project, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), is intended to anchor US economic engagement in the region, and it includes India, a non-Apec member.
 Working on the sidelines of Apec, negotiators are rushing to announce progress on IPEF's four pillars -- trade (connected economy); supply chains (resilient economy); clean energy, decarbonisation and infrastructure (clean economy); as well as tax and anti-corruption (fair economy). 
 Announcements are expected on clean and fair economy, while agreement on the resilient component was reached in September. Trade is the major sticking point. 
 "We can expect an 'early harvest' agreement, with some areas substantially concluded, some registering substantial progress, and others requiring more work," said veteran US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler. 
 "It has become more complicated for the US to achieve its goals in areas like labour and the environment without offering market access," she added, referring to the resistance from many nations to US demands for labour and environmental standards in trade.
 "As a result, the IPEF outcomes announced are likely to be more limited than initially expected when the talks were launched." 
 Ms Cutler, vice-president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, also said the evolution of Apec was consistent with the changing environment. 
 "The economic challenges facing Apec economies today go way beyond the need for further trade and investment liberalisation, so it's only natural that Apec's focus has evolved over the years."
 The US emphasis in 2023 on connectivity, sustainability and resiliency go right to the heart of the challenges Apec economies are grappling with today, she noted. The deliverables are expected to be announced in each of these areas, she added.
 The Apec leaders' joint declaration, still under negotiation, will underscore the progress made on strategic and economic goals.

Gaza war: Hard truths and humanitarian law

Bloodshed upon bloodshed. It has been six weeks since the brutal attacks by Hamas left over 1,200 people dead in Israel. The fate of more than 200 hostages remains unknown. Since then, around two-thirds of the population of Gaza Strip have been rendered homeless by the Israeli response to the Oct 7 terrorist attack. More than 11,000 people have died in the intense bombardment and ground offensive. 
 I am a good friend and admirer of Mr Bilahari Kausikan, who wrote an op-ed on the hard truths about the Gaza war's cruel and complex dilemmas. I agree with many points in his article.
 However, I do not agree with his statement that in view of the existential imperatives of Israel's response in Gaza, "humanitarian law and the laws of war take on a somewhat abstract quality as counsels of perfection". The same goes for the argument that Israel "will respect humanitarian law and the laws of war to the extent that it is practical". 
 This is how I look at the situation:
 There is no doubt that the attacks by Hamas on Israel are acts of terrorism and should be condemned. I am disappointed that some of my Arab and Muslim friends have refused to do so. I would respectfully point out to them that international law and international humanitarian law apply to Hamas as well as to Israel. No one is above the law, and Hamas must be held accountable for the atrocities it committed on Oct 7.
 Hamas is also to be condemned for its seizing of hostages, children included, on Oct 7. The taking of hostages is prohibited by international law and international humanitarian law. Hamas should release the hostages promptly and unconditionally.
 As for Israel, it has a right to defend itself against Hamas. However, Israel's right of self-defence must be proportionate and must not violate international law and international humanitarian law, which seeks to limit the effects of armed conflict. 
 Israel's obligation to comply with both is not "abstract" or "counsels of perfection". It is also incorrect to say that Israel will respect international law and international humanitarian law "to the extent that it is practical". The obligation by Israel to comply with both sets of laws is absolute, and not only when it is practical to do so. 
 Acts forbidden by international humanitarian lawThere are certain acts that are forbidden by international humanitarian law. These include collective punishment; attack on civilians; the destruction of civilian infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and ambulances as well as residential buildings; and the denial of human necessities to the civilian population, such as water, food, medicine and fuel.
 Israel's war against Hamas is a just war. However, it would seem that the war against Hamas has been transformed into a war against Palestinians in Gaza.
 Israel argues that Hamas uses civilians as human shields and that when civilian facilities are used to hide their fighters and arsenals, they become legitimate targets. But the massive scale of the devastation in Gaza as a result of Israeli military operations is disproportionate to its goal of destroying Hamas and cannot be justified. 
 Consider the appalling statistics that have turned Gaza into a "graveyard for children", in the words of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres: Of the 11,000 Palestinians killed, nearly half of them are children. On average, a child is killed every 10 minutes. 
 All but one of the hospitals in the north of Gaza have stopped functioning as Israel forces push deeper into Gaza and supplies of fuel, water, food and medicine to the besieged enclave become dangerously scarce.
 In short, it is not possible to justify the Israeli blockade or the bombing of schools, hospitals and ambulances in pursuit of its military goals.
 The hard truth is that both Hamas and Israel have committed war crimes.
 Peace between Israel and the PalestiniansWhen this war ends, we must launch new initiatives to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The end goals are clear: First, Israel must have the right to exist within secure and internationally recognised borders. 
 What are the "internationally recognised borders"? They are the borders prevailing in 1967, before the so-called Six Day War. Israel must return to the Palestinians all the territories it has occupied after that war, namely, Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. It is also necessary for the half-million Israelis to leave the settlements built illegally on Palestinian land.
 The second goal is for the Palestinians to have a state of their own. Only when the Palestinians are freed from Israeli occupation and are able to govern themselves will there be peace for Israel.
 In his op-ed, Mr Kausikan predicted that an independent Palestine will become "just another corrupt and badly governed Third World state". It is a presumptuous remark. I would also point out that there are some corrupt and badly governed states in the First World. 
 The Palestinians have waited since 1947 to have a state of their own. It is time for the world and for Israel to fulfil their aspiration. We should wish the Palestinians well and not discourage them. I remember that Mr Yasser Arafat, the late leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, once expressed his dream for Palestine to be the Singapore of the Middle East. I hope that one day, Mr Arafat's dream will come true.
 The Jewish people have suffered discrimination and persecution for thousands of years. After the horrors of the Holocaust, in which millions of Jews were killed, I understand and empathise with their aspirations to have a homeland of their own. I support the wish of the Israelis to live in peace and security. The problem is that in establishing the new state of Israel in Palestine, many Arab Palestinians had to flee or were driven from their homes and their lands.
 The governments of the Arab countries have committed several blunders at the expense of the Palestinian people. In 1947, they rejected the UN plan to divide the land of Palestine into two states, one for the Arabs and one for the Jewish people. They fought against Israel, in 1948, 1967 and 1973. The Palestinian people have suffered from those wars.
 More recently, under the Abraham Accords, several Arab countries such as Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco established diplomatic relations with Israel. But in normalising ties with Israel under the right-wing Netanyahu government, which has run roughshod over the two-state solution as envisaged in the 1993 Oslo Accords, they have also effectively abandoned the Palestinian cause.
 The Israel-Hamas war has reminded the world that the Israel-Palestine conflict has not been resolved.
 Since 1967, the Palestinians have lived under the oppressive rule of Israel. Like all of us, the Palestinians wish to be free; they wish to have a state of their own and to govern themselves.
 It is no contradiction that I support both Israel and the Palestinians. I support the aspiration of Israelis to live in peace and security. And I support the aspirations of the Palestinians to have their own state and to be free of Israeli rule. My dream for them is that, one day, Israel and the new state of Palestine will be good neighbours and will live in peace with each other. This dream will come true when there are strong leaders on both sides who have the will and courage to make peace. I hope that day will come soon.

The hospital that is a battleground between Hamas and Israel

Body


LONDON  Israeli soldiers have withdrawn from the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza after what they described as a "precise and targeted operation" against Hamas militants allegedly hiding inside the Palestinian territory's biggest medical facility. 
 But while the Israeli army ended Wednesday's politically sensitive operation without much bloodshed, Israel failed to provide significant incriminating evidence to back up its claim that Hamas misused the hospital.
 Chances are high, therefore, that the raid will be just one of many on Gaza's largest hospital to come as Israel and Hamas battle over the narrative of the current war.
 The iconic Al-Shifa hospital -- whose name translates as the "House of Healing" -- has often been described as Gaza's "beating heart".
 Dating back to the days of British colonial rule, its sprawling compound of former British army barrack buildings operated as a hospital even before Israel's creation.
 To the Israelis, Al-Shifa hospital is a prime example of Hamas' allegedly cynical strategy of hiding behind human shields in civilian facilities.
 For the Palestinians and their supporters, however, Israel's determination to control the hospital is seen as evidence that the Jewish state does not spare even the most helpless civilians in its war.
 The fact that Hamas, which has controlled Gaza for almost two decades, has used the hospital for its political purposes is not in much doubt.
 Amnesty International -- a human rights non-governmental organisation often highly critical of Israel -- has claimed as far back as 2014 that Hamas "interrogated and tortured or otherwise ill-treated" its political opponents "in a disused outpatient clinic" within the grounds of Al-Shifa.
 And during the current war, Al-Shifa kept its Internet connectivity at times when the rest of Gaza was cut off by Israel, so it has often been the venue for international media briefings by Hamas-affiliated officials.
 But Israel's claims about the hospital's alleged misuse by Hamas went much further.
 In late October, Israel released a video animation that supposedly showed an elaborate tunnel system constructed by Hamas under the hospital.
 Israel subsequently provided what it claimed to be further evidence for the existence of a Hamas "command and control complex".
 The United States backed up these assertions.
 "We have information that confirms that Hamas is using that particular hospital for a command and control node," US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Nov 14.
 The fact that some of the most intense fighting between the Israeli army and the Qassam Brigades -- Hamas' top combat units -- took place near the hospital was also interpreted as evidence that Al-Shifa was a vital stronghold that the Palestinian militants were keen to protect.
 But after more than 12 hours of searches by Israeli soldiers who questioned doctors and nursing staff, as well as set up electronic checkpoints at several entrances to the hospital, evidence of Hamas' presence remained meagre.
 Colonel Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli military, released on social media a video pointing out caches of weapons and related ammunition, which he alleged were found hidden behind disused medical equipment.
 But there was no mention of the extensive network of tunnels and, as the Israelis must have known, pictures of a handful of machine guns, which could have easily been placed there by anybody, are hardly likely to prove convincing.
 Israel's case was also not helped by the decision of the country's military spokesmen to delete shortly after publication some of the allegations they made on social media about the supposed military presence of Hamas inside the hospital.
 So, at least for now, the Israelis are not winning the propaganda war.
 However, this is hardly the end of the story.
 The tunnels could yet turn out to exist, but Israel may have decided to keep them out of the public eye for now, perhaps because this is where some of the Israeli hostages seized by Hamas are currently being held.
 There is also the possibility that the Israelis are refraining from storming tunnels that may exist under the hospital due to the delicate negotiations currently being brokered by the Gulf state of Qatar over a mutual exchange of prisoners between Hamas and Israel.
 And it remains, of course, perfectly possible that Israel's claim is false and that the hospital contains "only doctors, patients and displaced people", as the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry asserts.
 However, it is noticeable that social activists sympathetic to Hamas are now beginning to claim that the Israelis themselves built tunnels under the hospital during the 1980s, when Israel ruled the entire Gaza region.
 No evidence for this has been produced, and the assertion contradicts previous Hamas denials about the existence of any tunnels. Still, it may indicate that Hamas remains nervous about what the Israelis may yet reveal.
 Either way, Gaza's hospitals are destined to remain a critical battleground between Hamas and Israel.

Body


I write this letter in support of Professor Tommy Koh's op-ed "Gaza war: Hard truths and humanitarian law" (Nov 17). I thank him for his kind views on the Palestinians, which means even more since he considers himself to be a friend of Israel. I would like to add a few points.
 First, condemnation of the killings of innocent lives and violations of international law must be unequivocal. Just as the pro-Palestinian side must not attempt to justify what Hamas did, there must be condemnation, and not merely expressions of disappointment or sadness, when Palestinians are the victims.
 Second, there has been a downplaying of dehumanisation attempts that have been made by prominent individuals. Over the years Israeli politicians have denigrated Palestinians, with some even comparing them to "animals". This dehumanisation needs to stop for there to truly be peace, and the media should do far more to call it out.
 Third, understanding the historical roots of the crisis is vital for us to comprehend the current situation. If we know the history of the conflict, we are better able to recognise the contemporary realities, grievances, frustrations and aspirations of the populations involved. 
 To paraphrase Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, it is crucial for Palestinians to know that there is a future for them, in order for peace to genuinely be pursued.
 For the humanitarian crisis to end, a ceasefire must be implemented immediately, all sides must go to the negotiating table, and most importantly, occupation must end and Palestinian statehood under a two-state solution -- which Singapore officially supports -- must become a reality and not just rhetoric.

Israel's actions in Gaza have been disproportionate

Byline: Ahmad Firdaus Daud, Israel's actions in Gaza have been disproportionate
Body


During the 10th Emergency Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Oct 27, Singapore voted in favour of a resolution calling for an "immediate humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities" and condemning the violence against both Palestinian and Israeli civilians.
 Israel ignored that resolution. It has dropped more than 25,000 tonnes of explosives on Gaza Strip and deployed thousands of soldiers and tanks in a ground invasion, striking hospitals, places of worship, refugee camps and UN shelters. 
 More than 11,000 civilians have been killed, many of whom were children, and 1.6 million have been displaced. The death count has been verified by UN humanitarian teams.
 These actions have been disproportionate. They likely violate international humanitarian law. Singapore ministers have raised this in Parliament and have counselled Israel to exercise restraint and comply with the rules governing the conduct of war.
 No departure from international lawI recently read Bilahari Kausikan's opinion piece in The Straits Times on the matter ("Hard truths about Gaza war's cruel and complex dilemma", Nov 11). While most of what he said in the article was factual, his characterisation of Israel's actions in Gaza omits key considerations under international law and do not reflect the principled approach taken in Singapore's national position on this issue.
 It is disconcerting that Mr Kausikan would suggest that the rules of war could be less than binding on Israel or, in his words, take on an "abstract quality as counsels of perfection". 
 His opinion piece invites us to accept that Israel would, in its exercise of the right of self-defence, need to comply with international humanitarian law only to the extent that it is practical. Mr Kausikan implicitly argues that Israel has no choice but to react disproportionately in Gaza and against its civilians to re-establish deterrence. 
 Justifying departures from international humanitarian law for practical reasons is a perilous proposition. Upholding the core principles of distinction, proportionality, and humanity, even in complex situations, is paramount and should not be compromised for the sake of expediency.
 Israel has agency. Israel chose not to pursue a more restrained or covert approach for whatever reasons. We know that disproportionate action is politically expedient for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who holds tenuous leadership over a right-wing coalition racked with domestic instability prior to Oct 7.
 Recent history in this part of the world also throws up examples suggesting another way. In 2008, following a terrorist attack in Mumbai that killed at least 166 people, the Indian government opted not to undertake an overt military strike on terrorist camps in Pakistan. 
 Instead, it responded with restraint and precision through diplomatic and covert channels. These actions brought international support, minimised casualties, and arguably prevented more terrorism.
 Confronting historyA useful assessment of history requires us to consider all relevant facts and not take a piecemeal approach that suits our perspective. Unfortunately, Mr Kausikan omitted mention of the longstanding illegality of Israel's occupation and control over the West Bank and Gaza, as declared by various UN organs, and Israel's treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
 Nothing justifies any killing of innocent Israeli civilians by Hamas fighters on Oct 7. Such acts are breaches of international humanitarian law and must be condemned.
 But we also should not deny the questions raised over Israel's legal justification for its longstanding actions in Gaza, and in the West Bank where Hamas is not present.
 The International Court of Justice's (ICJ) advisory opinion in 2004 rejected Israel's right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter with regard to threats and attacks originating from the occupied Palestinian territories. The court held that Israel, therefore, cannot rely on that right to justify the wall Israel built within those territories.
 While the ICJ has not yet expressed its opinion on matters beyond the legality of the wall, the rejection of the right to self-defence within the context of an occupation or annexation is not novel or controversial. It is well-enforced by the core principle that no state may implement coercive measures to disenfranchise other peoples of their right to self-determination.
 All this does not mean that Israel cannot take steps to defend itself within its legal borders from attacks by an insurgent militant force. Israel can take defensive steps within its borders to protect its citizens. 
 But there is legitimate doubt over whether Israel has sufficient legal justifications for its ongoing military action outside its borders and in Gaza, given the destruction there and harm caused to Palestinian civilians.
 Johor is not GazaMr Kausikan's "thought experiment" regarding rockets fired from Johor is misplaced and does not parallel the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories. Johor is not under Singapore's illegal occupation, allowing Singapore the right under Article 51 of the UN Charter to act in self-defence against aggression from a state or a terrorist non-state actor. 
 Singapore also does not have the same protracted history with its neighbours that Israel has with the occupied Palestinian territories that involve documented breaches of international law, or the pursuit of divide-and-conquer strategies of funding one non-state actor to isolate another.
 In any case, I am confident the Singapore Government would turn to a military response only as a last resort, and we would abide by international norms.
 In lieu of Mr Kausikan's characterisation of the Israel-Hamas conflict, consider a different thought experiment where we put ourselves in the shoes of Palestinians in Gaza.
 Imagine Singapore being annexed and coming under the occupation of a foreign power, having been unable to maintain our sovereignty.
 Wouldn't we be seeking the full extent of our rights under international humanitarian law to be treated with dignity, to be granted our right of self-determination? As powerless people, wouldn't we rely on and expect the intervention of the international community to expel the occupying force'
 Trust and supportLast, even if all these considerations were laid aside and we were to consider Israel's military campaign purely from an effectiveness standpoint, the verdict is fuzzy. There is significant doubt that this military campaign to eradicate Hamas would even succeed. History has shown that to successfully remove an insurgency, one must first gain the trust and support of the ground population. 
 To dismantle Hamas in the present manner, Israel has opted to incur a staggering cost to civilian lives and the international community would be compelled to hold it to account. Israel is hurtling towards a lose-lose outcome.
 The only acceptable conclusion to this crisis is a two-state solution in line with past UN resolutions and a return to pre-1967 borders. This would also delegitimise attempts by regional parties to antagonise Israel through the Palestinian cause.
 As a friend to Israel as well as the Palestinian people, and as a proponent of the rules-based international order, Singapore should be consistent in advocating for restraint and adherence to international consensus, and an immediate truce leading to a cessation of hostilities as outlined in the UNGA resolution on Oct 27. 
 To maintain our credibility on the international stage and to ensure social cohesion, we should refrain from rhetoric that encourages violence or rationalises breaches of international law and make clear our commitment to fairness and the principles of international norms.
 Ahmad Firdaus Daud is a lawyer and community leader, and works with Roses of Peace to advocate for peace and social harmony.

S'pore 'deeply regrets' impact of Israeli military ops on Gaza hospital

Singapore "deeply regrets" the impact of Israel's military operations on Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on Nov 17.
 "We strongly urge Israel to do its utmost to protect all civilians and medical facilities in Gaza. We urge all parties to comply fully with international humanitarian law," it said in a statement.
 "Civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, should be protected." 
 MFA also said that Hamas should not use these premises for military purposes or civilians as human shields, and reiterated its call for the immediate and safe release of civilian hostages in Gaza.
 On Nov 15, Israeli troops entered Al-Shifa, Gaza's biggest hospital, following a days-long siege that has caused global alarm over the fate of civilians trapped inside. 
 Reuters quoted a Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson as saying that there was no water, food or baby milk in the hospital, which was packed with 650 patients and about 7,000 people displaced by weeks of Israeli air strikes and artillery bombardments. 
 MFA also said that Singapore remains deeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. 
 Palestinian civilians have borne the brunt of Israel's weeks-long military campaign in retaliation for an Oct 7 attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel also says that Hamas took more than 240 hostages. 
 Singapore welcomed the adoption of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2712, which calls for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors in Gaza. 
 The resolution was adopted by the Security Council on Nov 15, with 12 members voting in favour, none against and three abstentions (Russia, Britain and the United States). 
 "Every effort must be made for the immediate, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian aid to affected civilians throughout Gaza," MFA added. 
 The Al-Shifa Hospital has become the main target of Israel's ground operation.
 The Israeli military has claimed that Hamas has its headquarters in tunnels beneath the facility, which the Palestinian militant group denies. 
 MFA said that Singapore will continue to work closely with its humanitarian partners to offer additional assistance and support to the Palestinian people. 
 Reuters reported that Gaza health authorities deemed reliable by the UN had said that at least 11,500 people have been confirmed killed, more than 4,700 of them children, in the Israeli bombardment and ground invasion.
 Since the war began, more than two-thirds of Gaza's population of 2.3 million have fled their homes. 
 There have been limited deliveries of humanitarian relief crossing from Egypt into Gaza since Oct 21.

When many of us were feeling depressed to see the violence raging between Russia and Ukraine, the war between Hamas and Israel erupted. 
 Professor Tommy Koh has pointed out both sides have committed war crimes (Gaza war: Hard truths and humanitarian law, Nov 17). Although he is acknowledged internationally as an expert on the Law of the Sea, he has always been concerned with the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbours. 
 He wrote that he was disappointed with some of his Arab and Muslim friends for defending the Hamas attack on Israel. I think many Arab and Muslims hold the opposite views. Many who are pro-Palestinian hold Hamas to have done wrong. 
 The fact that occupied Palestine is an open prison cannot mitigate the wrong actions of Hamas, which are not only against global ethics but also international law.

When TikTok and X become news sources on the Israel-Hamas conflict

Body


Over the past 40-plus days, I have spent more time on TikTok, Telegram and X, formerly Twitter, than I have in the prior nine months of this year.
 Call it a job hazard.
 Hamas militants' assault on Israel on Oct 7 and the acts of terror committed against civilians, and the resulting response by the Israeli military and the steep toll exacted on civilians, have upended the news cycle.
 Global news agencies scramble to piece together information and keep viewers updated on developments on the ground in a timely and fairly comprehensive manner, guided by principles journalists and many mainstream media outlets try to abide by -- balance, objectivity, giving the various sides of a story.
 But at a time when new digital tools and platforms are able to bring the conflict directly to my screen -- and those of millions of others anywhere in the world -- I thought, why not try to get a better sense of its intensity by following raw footage, and the occasional livestream? 
 OverwhelmedFollowing was difficult, with the flood of content. I was deluged with material.
 In the initial weeks, the barrage of posts, photos and videos on these platforms highlighted the severity of the ongoing conflict, and painted a picture of a humanitarian catastrophe unfolding before our eyes: Israeli Defence Forces armour and artillery  outside Gaza, buildings being taken out and civilian Palestinians rushed to the hospitals -- when many were still operating.
 The visuals were -- and still are -- graphic, and tug at the heartstrings.
 Some of the videos provide a useful education on the complicated history of the region and the complexity of the issues involved, dating back more than a century and spanning seven major wars, not to mention several skirmishes and violent exchanges. Little wonder that sentiments around this conflict in the Middle East have become deep-seated and intractable.
 But the more I read and watched, the more concerns I had about whether what I was viewing was true, or even from the current conflict. 
 The facts, as underlined by the United Nations and World Health Organisation, are not in doubt. As at Nov 18, Hamas' Oct 7 attacks have killed 1,200 people and seen the taking of over 200 hostages. Israel's response has seen at least 11,500 Gazans killed, 70 per cent of them women and children, and some 1.7 million people have been displaced. Two-thirds of Gaza's hospitals are out of action, and fuel, electricity, water and food are in short supply.
 But some visual posts seemed a little too incredulous to be true, yet they had gone viral and stoked a wave of angry comments. Many have since been debunked by journalists and fact checkers, but continue to be propagated.
 This misinformation includes material put out by Hamas and its leaders, as well as by Israeli politicians and military. 
 BBC senior journalist Shayan Sardarizadeh, who covers disinformation, extremism and conspiracy theories, said in an interview published last week by Oxford University's Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism: "You can find good information on social media.
 "But I can excuse anybody for feeling confused if they've been looking online in the last few days because it's been really difficult to sift through what is actually genuine footage from what's been going on in Israel and Gaza, and what is either clickbait or unrelated footage or something that is being shared for clicks, engagement or any sort of nefarious intent." 
 Social media has opened up the information space considerably, but the space is also in disarray. It is divided and has polarised views. When fiction becomes indistinguishable from fact, even reaching common points of understanding on the conflict can be a challenging exercise, let alone finding areas of agreement.
 Into the rabbit holeI have two TikTok accounts, and I began following users who reposted videos from Palestinian outfits and others more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause on one, and videos from Israeli outfits and other pro-Israel accounts on the other.
 One could, of course, follow various users on the same account, but what I found helped me understand why views on this conflict and its causes appear more divided than a decade ago.
 On the Palestinian channel, posts include rallies in Europe and on American campuses as well as from Israelis opposed to their government. Footage of Gazan victims of Israeli bombardment carrying dead and injured family members, including children, and those displaced struggling to cope amid the tragedy inundated my feeds.
 On the Israeli channel, posts comprise visuals of the victims of Hamas' Oct 7 attack on southern Israel, including Arab citizens of Israel, as well as rallies in Europe and Israel in support of the Israeli military response, and videos highlighting statements from Hamas declaring opposition to any form of peace settlement. 
 Staying abreast of global developments and having access to first-person accounts should technically make us more informed. But relying on social media for  news can trap us in echo chambers and rabbit holes.
 A medium that has become, for many, an alternative to traditional media broadcasting has become a prime example of narrowcasting.
 Narrowcasting in some media channels in America and Europe is actually strategy. For resonance and stickiness, many have evolved to cater to narrower audiences, to echo and reinforce a certain view of the world.
 But the ease of access and widespread availability of social media has, I fear, made this trend more pronounced, aided by algorithms that push content aligned to individual viewers' preferences. 
 The nature of TikTok means the clips could create a tunnel vision, serving up content that readers are more likely to access based on what they previously viewed, and who they follow and like.
 For its part, TikTok says it does not "promote" one side of an issue over another, but notes that the videos people view, like and share inform the recommendation algorithm about content they might find relevant.
 It also makes clear its position against posts that cross the line, adding that numerous posts have been removed for violating its policies on violence, hate speech, misinformation and terrorism.
 Its community guidelines page states, in bold: "We do not allow the presence of violent and hateful organisations or individuals on our platform."
 Such individuals will be placed under review, and could get their accounts banned, it says.
 "We do not allow anyone to promote or materially support violent or hateful actors," TikTok adds. This goes some way towards addressing some concerns, but does not stop such content from resurfacing or being amplified by others.
 Still, developments over the past month have deepened this polarisation globally, translating into divides on the ground that will not be easily bridged.
 Closer to home, in a country where about 2.4 million users have TikTok accounts, individuals who express support for one side or the other on social media have been criticised and doxxed. Some of this is a reflection of how societies globally are becoming polarised on various issues.
 But for there to be a meaningful resolution to the current conflict, there must be an awareness of how the other side feels, and a realisation that views need to be moderated, and differences talked through.
 BreakthroughsOne of my earliest exposures to the Middle East conflict was in September 1993, when the first peace treaty between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) was signed on the White House lawn.
 My Secondary 1 form teacher held up a copy of The Straits Times on Sept 14, 1993. The front page article showed then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO chief Yasser Arafat in a historic handshake signifying a landmark breakthrough.
 That act of leadership and courage saw staunch opposition by hardliners on both sides, but the two leaders pressed on to seal a deal that raised hopes for peace in the Middle East.
 Alas, developments since then, including domestic political pressures, would stymie hopes that the deal, known as the first Oslo Accord, would eventually pave the way for an independent Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel.
 Mr Rabin was subsequently assassinated by an Israeli extremist opposed to the peace agreement.
 Thirty years later, international calls for a two-state solution have gained new traction, even though the conditions on the ground today are much less ideal. Today, the conditions are tougher, radicals much louder, and the extremes much more intractable.
 The deepening polarisation between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and the international communities which support them, is also worrying.
 Observers note a sharp spike in incidents of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia globally, and have raised fears that opportunistic extremist groups could capitalise on these tensions to gain support.
 One hopes for a political solution to the present conflict, uphill as it may be. 
 But realistically, it is unlikely to be resolved any time soon.
 And the more tensions linger, the greater the risk that the  wave of misinformation and polarisation will grow, with repercussions for societies worldwide that are navigating differences in opinions, creating fissures and fractures.
 Hopefully, more people will grow aware of the dangers of relying solely on social media for news, and become more conscious of the need to take a break from their digital feeds. We need to consider the impact of what we watch and spread might have on ourselves, the people who hold different views and society as a whole.

Israel's right to self-defence does not extend to indiscriminate killing of civilians: Shanmugam

Body


 Israel has a right to self-defence, but this does not extend to indiscriminate killing of civilians or mass displacement of entire populations, said Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam. 
 Collective punishment is also illegal, he said, in the context of what is now happening in Gaza.  Mr Shanmugam said in a Facebook post on Nov 18: "The scale of the tragedy in Gaza is immense. Thousands being killed. Devastation (on) this scale is very difficult to accept."
 The Israel-Hamas war started on Oct 7, when Hamas militants attacked Israel and killed 1,200 people, who were mostly civilians, and took 240 hostages.
 The Israeli strikes that followed have hit those living in Gaza hard, with more than 12,000 people killed, of which 5,000 were children.
 Mr Shanmugam's comments were in response to a Nov 11 opinion piece by retired senior diplomat Bilahari Kausikan that was published by The Straits Times.
 In "Hard truths about Gaza war's cruel and complex dilemmas", Mr Kausikan said that Singaporeans should not dismiss the depth of the trauma inflicted by the barbarism of the Oct 7 attack. 
 "This cannot be justified by any reason," he said.
 The resulting response from Israel was "certainly not a war of revenge", and that it was exercising its inherent right to self-defence to restore deterrence.
 "Restoring deterrence is an existential issue for Israel. Deterrence based on military superiority is one of the pillars on which Israel's right to exist has rested from its very foundation," said Mr Kausikan. 
 Mr Shanmugam noted that while Mr Kausikan had condemned Hamas' actions, the opinion piece does not emphasise the illegal actions by the Israeli government, over many years.
 This included establishing settlements in the West Bank and, in essence, preventing a two-state solution. It also does not deal with the severe restrictions that had been imposed on the population of Gaza, in effect denying any hope to the Palestinians, added Mr Shanmugam.
 "The truth is that Israeli government actions have been contrary to international law, and oppressive to the Palestinians. One can say this while also accepting that parts of the Palestinian leadership has acted very badly, seeking the complete wipe-out of Israel."
 Both the Israeli and Palestinian leadership are responsible for the current situation and the peace process not progressing, said Mr Shanmugam. 
 He also highlighted the Nov 18 opinion piece in The Straits Times by lawyer and community leader Ahmad Firdaus Daud, "Israel's actions in Gaza have been disproportionate".
 Mr Firdaus noted that most of what Mr Kausikan wrote was factual, but took issue with his characterisation of Israel's actions in Gaza.
 It omitted key considerations under international law and does not reflect the principled approach taken in Singapore's national position on this issue, said Mr Firdaus, who works with interfaith initiative Roses of Peace to advocate for peace and social harmony in Singapore.
 "To maintain our credibility on the international stage and to ensure social cohesion, we should refrain from rhetoric that encourages violence or rationalises breaches of international law, and make clear our commitment to fairness and the principles of international norms," he said.
 Mr Shanmugam said that Mr Firdaus helps him on-and-off at his Meet-the-People Sessions.
 As the war continues, meanwhile in Singapore, the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery has donated $50,000 to Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation for people in Gaza. 
 Mr Shanmugam said: "Very heartening. This is Singapore."

Despite record temperatures, COP28 climate agenda risks being overshadowed

Byline: Vinod Thomas, Despite record temperatures, COP28 climate agenda risks being overshadowed
Body


The world is currently in a state of delirium, as the pain that atmospheric emissions are inflicting on the planet is numbed by the financial gains of fossil fuels producers. Meanwhile, some 70,000 delegates from 196 nations will begin gathering in Dubai at the end of November for the two week-long United Nations' Conference of Parties, or COP28, the latest instalment of the biggest climate change summit on the planet. 
 With 2023 on track to be the hottest year on record and threatened with the collapse of ecosystems on multiple fronts, the stakes could not be higher to move the needle on cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. But the climate emergency is in danger of being overshadowed as attention is diverted by geopolitical tensions, major conflicts and economic crises around the world. 
 Climate of crisesTo be sure, COP events have taken place against the backdrop of other global priorities, with the 2008 global financial crisis and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 being two compelling examples. The difficulty of negotiating among nearly 200 countries, as well as the intractability and "super wickedness" of the climate agenda, already make for lacklustre outcomes, but competing priorities make the task even more daunting.
 Even as global warming reaches a boiling point, other worries appear even more urgent to decision-makers. 
 Russia's war with Ukraine that started on Feb 24, 2022, shows no sign of ending, aggravating security risks, adding to energy insecurity, and creating food shortages around the world. The Covid-19 pandemic that broke out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 continues to take a toll, causing an increase in the number of people living in extreme poverty for the first time in more than two decades.
 The Palestinian militant group Hamas' unprecedented attack on Israel on Oct 7, Israel's retaliatory, brutal air and ground offensive in Gaza, and the rising tensions in the Middle East have sent shockwaves around the world. The big concern is the possibility of an escalation of the war that could bring Israel in direct confrontation with Iran. In a scenario of widening conflict, energy prices would soar with global economic growth dipping.
 The risk facing COP28 is that these emergencies would crowd out the attention accorded to the climate crisis. Yet, slowing runaway climate change determines whether progress on all other fronts means anything. Indeed, the world can far less afford a disastrous summit in 2023, as this will dim any hope of averting a full-blown climate catastrophe.
 In fact, the COP28 agenda calls for unprecedented action, including a doubling of energy efficiency and a tripling of renewable energy capacity by 2030 while, as a minimum, vastly exceeding the 2009 initial commitment of rich nations for US$100 billion (S$134 billion) a year to poorer countries for climate action. But all this would be the relatively easy part.
 Since the atmosphere is impacted only by the amount of carbon emitted, of greatest importance is the phasing out of oil and gas and the imposition of a moratorium on coal, the biggest polluter. But a breakthrough on decarbonisation will be tougher, especially at this summit in the Middle East, amid the concerns over energy security.
 Past events speak to the elusiveness of the climate agenda in the face of other exigencies.
 Last year's COP27 in Egypt, coming on the heels of the Ukraine war, found energy security worries dwarfing climate concerns. The summit eventually featured no agreement on phasing out coal, oil and gas, and only a weak reference to keeping the global temperature staying below 1.5 deg C.
 As concerns over the economy and energy mounted, numerous policy reversals followed the conference. The UK made a U-turn on abandoning new oil drilling in the North Sea. In New York state, the governor vetoed offshore wind projects from connecting to the power grid on Long Island. Approvals of energy plants burning fossil fuels continued in China, India and South-east Asia. 
 Going further back in time, we see a similar pattern.
 COP14 in 2008 in Poznan and COP15 in 2009 in Copenhagen were obscured by the precedence of the 2008 global financial crisis. The uninspired COP26 in 2021 in Glasgow took place against the backdrop of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic.
 Absence of leadershipThe commitment of the host nation and the level of participation also matter. 
 The disorganised COP25 in 2019 in Madrid failed, with hundreds of high-octane fossil fuel representatives lobbying for their cause. The signal from 2023's COP28 chair, the United Arab Emirates, in just approving a massive gas pipeline, does not help. 
 Indeed, the UAE has appointed Dr Sultan Al Jaber, head of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, which is driving a vast expansion of GHGs from its oil and gas products, as COP28 president. 
 The most successful conference, COP21 in 2015 in Paris, on the other hand, was driven by the engagement of the host nation, and the participation of President Barack Obama and the US administration. 
 But the US role under Mr Obama's predecessor, President George W. Bush, was to undermine a revival of the Kyoto Protocol in 2005 that could have helped in climate negotiations. Subsequently, Mr Obama's successor, President Donald Trump, in 2016 reneged on the Paris commitment and was hardly present, or promoted fossil fuels, at COP events. 
 On Aug 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the sweeping Inflation Reduction Act into law, which includes US$370 billion for decarbonising the economy. While the United States and China (together comprising 38 per cent of global carbon effluents) just agreed to accelerate the substitution of fossil fuels, the impression is that Mr Biden might skip the Dubai conference in view of the other pressing priorities. 
 The physical presence of the leaders of the major emitting nations is key to progress in Dubai, so the absence of Mr Biden could put a major dent on the summit even before it begins.
 Minimum targetsTo achieve even moderate success against these odds, COP28 would need a sharp focus on a smart agenda. 
 To this end, it would help to put the top 10 to 20 emitting countries, starting with China, the US and India, that make up two-thirds to four-fifths, respectively, of global emissions front and centre. Past meetings have featured endless wrangling among all the participating nations.
 Furthermore, COP28 should make decarbonisation the top priority, setting its eyes on halving emissions by 2030. It should not kick the can down the road by focusing mostly on net-zero in 2050 and beyond. 
 A firm position is needed to end exploration of oil and gas, redirecting around US$1 trillion of planned annual fossil fuel investment by 2030 towards energy transition. Multilateral development banks should stop all fossil fuel-based financing, including trade finance enabling fossil fuel transactions.
 Another area for immediate measures is tackling the subsidies to fossil fuels.
 Global fossil fuel subsidies were estimated at US$7 trillion in 2022, equivalent to nearly 7.1 per cent of global gross domestic product. They are a sum of explicit financial subsidies to the producers of fossil fuels and implicit subsidies enabling environmental and health damage. When the world faces an existential crisis, encouraging more fossil fuel use makes no sense.
 The geopolitical turmoil and economic hardships make the climate focus harder, but there are some vital steps that cannot wait for life on the planet.

Arab nations play China card to give US a Gaza nudge

Byline: Jonathan Eyal Global, Arab nations play China card to give US a Gaza nudge
Body


For the past seven weeks, the Arab governments of the Middle East have watched helplessly as Israeli forces pounded Gaza. Except for Qatar, which has worked tirelessly to broker a deal under which Israeli hostages held by the Hamas militant organisation are to be exchanged for Hamas fighters held by Israel, the rest of the Arab world was reduced to issuing ineffectual protests while the number of civilian Palestinian casualties continued to mount.
 No longer, however. A delegation comprising foreign ministers from Middle Eastern and other Islamic states has now embarked on a tour of key world capitals, in a first example of a serious diplomatic effort to stop the fighting.
 The delegation enjoys broad political support and legitimacy: It includes not only the foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Qatar and Saudi Arabia -- all of whom belong to the Arab League -- but also the chief diplomats of Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey, who are members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
 Even more importantly, the delegation is launching its efforts not at the United Nations nor in the United States, where most of the diplomacy related to the war is currently conducted, but by travelling to Beijing to talk to the Chinese government about measures to stop the Gaza bloodshed.
 The fact that the foreign ministers of the Arab and Islamic worlds are turning to China first in their quest for a cessation of hostilities indicates both their acute anger with the US and the more subtle strategic change taking place in the Middle East.
 Most Arab governments, as well as a majority of security analysts worldwide, believe that the US either does not care about what is currently happening in Gaza, or is powerless to force Israel to stop its current military offensive.
 The intense level of frustration that this generates among Arab nations was on full display at the weekend at a security meeting in Manama, the capital of the Gulf kingdom of Bahrain, where Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi got into a sharp public verbal confrontation with Mr Brett McGurk, US President Joe Biden's special envoy to the Middle East.
 "If any other country in the world did a fragment of what Israel did, it would have sanctions imposed on it from every corner of the world," Mr Safadi told Mr McGurk. "Even those who accept Israel's actions as self-defence keep telling Israel to act within international law. It is not, so where do we go from here? Keep telling them to do it'" the visibly exasperated Jordanian diplomat asked.
 Still, arguments that Washington either does not care or is powerless to act to stop the bloodshed are mistaken. US diplomats are fully aware of the damage their support for Israel is causing to America's reputation in the Muslim world. And President Biden does not need many reminders to realise that his unswerving support for Israel is costing him votes at home, especially among younger members of his Democratic Party.
 Nor is the US powerless in its dealings with Israel. When Washington puts its foot down and tells Israel to stop doing something, the Jewish state usually listens. In the current war, for instance, it was President Biden who single-handedly wrote the rules of engagement between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iranian-funded militia based in Lebanon, by offering Israel a security guarantee against Hezbollah in return for an Israeli promise not to be provoked into expanding the current war into Lebanon. And -- to use another example -- when Israel cut off all Internet connection in Gaza, a quick message from Washington had all these Internet connections swiftly restored.
 The problem is not that the US is powerless to act but, instead, that the US still supports some of Israel's strategic objectives in this war. Washington wants Hamas to be destroyed, or at least degraded to a level that it will no longer be a force to be reckoned with in the Middle East for years to come.
 The Americans also believe that by offering support to Israel, the US will be able to influence Israeli military actions and reduce the toll of civilian casualties while also ensuring that, when the fighting is over, a future Israeli government will be ready to make political concessions to the Palestinians. President Biden's policy is, therefore, to embrace Israel in a very tight bear hug, which, while reassuring for the leaders of the Jewish state, also limits their options.
 In private, the overwhelming majority of Arab governments also want to see Hamas defeated or at least cut down to size. The organisation is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that most Arab governments dread. If Hamas can plausibly claim to have emerged victorious from its current confrontation with Israel, this could endanger the future stability of almost every existing Arab government.
 But at the same time, the current US position, which is to support Israel's strategy of pounding Gaza, is also undermining the stability of Arab states. Outraged Arab people now dismiss their national leaders as just impotent bystanders to a wholesale Palestinian massacre. Unless this anger is addressed, it could translate into a wave of revolts similar to the so-called Arab Spring in 2011, which threatened to overthrow existing regimes. 
 Meanwhile, even those Arab states that regard themselves as America's closest regional allies -- countries such as Jordan or the Gulf states, for instance -- have zero influence on a Biden policy which seems obsessed with just micro-managing Israeli sensitivities. That is why China is now the first port of call for Arab and Muslim foreign ministers.
 Why China'Beijing has adopted a very low profile in the current conflict. It has refused to blame Hamas for the murder of around 1,200 Israelis in October and has called for a ceasefire in the Gaza war. It has sent veteran diplomat Zhai Jun -- who served in the past as China's deputy foreign minister -- to the region.
 But Mr Zhai's trip yielded nothing and was not taken seriously by Israel.
 "His job is to broadcast China's narrative to the world. His job is not to try to put an end to this war or to make some kind of mediation between the parties," Ms Galia Lavi, the deputy director of an Israel-China policy centre at Tel Aviv's Institute for National Security Studies, explained in comments to the media at the time of the Chinese envoy's visit.
 And unlike President Biden, who visited Israel soon after the crisis started, or US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who remains engaged in constant shuttle diplomacy in the region, no senior Chinese politician toured the area since the start of the war or expressed any intention of doing so.
 So why are Arab and Muslim foreign ministers launching their latest diplomatic initiative in Beijing'
 One explanation is purely presentational: It's easier for the ministers to go to China, where they can present themselves as pioneers in a new political process, rather than fly to Washington, where they risk being seen as mere supplicants. 
 The fact that China currently holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council also helped persuade the foreign ministers that Beijing should be their first port of call.
 China's official position on the current conflict -- which is to derive maximum comfort from America's discomfort -- also suits the visiting Arab and Muslim foreign ministers. 
 In a variety of editorials over the past few weeks, the government-controlled China Daily newspaper charged the US with "adding fuel to the fire by blindly backing Israel". At the same time, the state-run Global Times claimed that the US was "stained with the blood of innocent civilians" after the Americans vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for the cessation of hostilities in Gaza.
 But beyond the presentational aspects, Arab governments genuinely hope to persuade Beijing to become more engaged in the Middle East. 
 That's not because China can act as a regional power broker -- it cannot yet hope to match either the influence or military presence of the US -- but because a higher Chinese profile in the Middle East acts as a sharp reminder to America of just how much it stands to lose by ignoring or by taking for granted US allies throughout the Arab world.
 That happened in March 2023 when China brokered a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, under which the region's traditional enemies restored diplomatic relations. In reality, the Saudis and the Iranians secretly negotiated their accommodation many months previously, so all the Chinese did was come in at the last moment and help them hold hands together in public. However, the fact that Iran and Saudi Arabia wanted China to play the mediator, coupled with China's readiness to use this opportunity, shocked the Americans, forcing them to pay more attention to the region.
 The Arab and Muslim foreign ministers hope to repeat this experience now.
 Taking the U.S. by surpriseWill it work? Will the foreign ministers' delegation persuade China to introduce a new draft resolution in the UN Security Council demanding a Gaza ceasefire during the last remaining week of China's presidency of the council in November? Will China use the foreign ministers' visit to voice criticism of the US? And can China reach out to Israel to engage in a more active mediation effort'
 The answers to all these questions lie ahead of us. What remains clear, however, is that the US did not expect this Arab and Muslim initiative.
 On Nov 18, President Biden published an extended essay in The Washington Post, in which he defended his country's record and outlined his administration's vision of the future Middle East.
 The Americans want to end this vicious war with the introduction of a peacekeeping force in Gaza to ensure that neither Israel nor Hamas remain in control of the territory. Mr Biden also wants the moderate but hitherto marginalised Palestinian Authority to take over both Gaza and the West Bank.
 Interestingly, however, President Biden did not mention China even once in his Washington Post article. Instead, he touted the US as "the essential nation"; "The world looks to us to solve the problems of our time," Mr Biden claimed.
 Well, yes and no. Undoubtedly, it's only the US that can force Israel to stop its current offensive; left to its own devices, Israel plans to go on bombing Gaza for months to come. 
 Yet, what is equally apparent is that the vast reconstruction effort that has to follow any cessation of hostilities requires the money of oil-rich Arab countries. 
 And Arab cooperation is even more needed for any future political process.
 The man in the White House believes that, after a period of ignoring Arab governments, he can turn to them to pick up the costs for the reconstruction of everything Israel destroyed in Gaza. By travelling to Beijing rather than Washington at the start of their mission to stop the fighting, the foreign ministers of Arab and Muslim nations are hoping to remind Washington that the days when the US decided everything and passed on the bills to others may be numbered.

Full-scale counter-terrorism drill back after pandemic hiatus

A joint counter-terrorism exercise by the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) was held on Nov 20, amid heightened security concerns over the conflict in the Middle East. 
 Exercise Heartbeat, which involved more than 100 participants and included units such as SPF's Emergency Response Team (ERT) as well as ground response officers, was held at the Millenia Singapore integrated development.
 Ms Sun Xueling, Minister of State for Home Affairs, and Social and Family Development, who observed the exercise, said: "As we all know, we are living in a time of global strife and uncertainty."
 A number of countries have enhanced security around potential Jewish targets and at pro-Palestinian demonstrations, after an attack on Oct 7 by Hamas, which led to a massive military operation by Israeli forces in Gaza.
 In Singapore, possible targets for attack have had their security reassessed, with patrols stepped up at events and places in the light of the Gaza situation.
 Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam said on Oct 12 that terrorist groups could try to exploit global conflicts such as the Israel-Hamas war. 
 He added that some extremist groups have already issued calls for followers to join a wider jihad against Israel, while reports of anti-Semitic attacks have increased globally. 
 The full-scale exercise on Nov 20 was the first after a hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A smaller-scale Exercise Heartbeat was held at Singapore Management University in 2022, without the presence of external partners.
 SPF said officers and volunteers acted out scenarios that allowed both agencies to simulate emergency responses at the Millenia Singapore integrated development, which houses office buildings, hotels and shops. 
 The development is located next to Suntec City. 
 The exercise involved a simulation of a suicide bombing, as well as a hostage situation and a vehicular attack on civilians.
 At about 10am, an actor, playing a terrorist, delivered a suspicious package to the concierge of Millenia Tower, which sparked an evacuation. Minutes later, he detonated a device he was wearing on a vest. 
 As injured civilians scrambled to safety, two gunmen appeared and fired rounds indiscriminately. An SPF In-Situ Reaction Team was at the scene within minutes.
 The officers, who were armed with HK-MP5 sub-machine guns, are trained to respond to any public security threats at pre-identified high-risk locations with high footfall.
 Ground response forces and ERT officers were also activated to subdue the gunmen. 
 ERT officers, who are handpicked from police land divisions based on fitness levels and marksmanship skills, serve as the first wave of responders to safety and security-related incidents in Singapore, including terrorist attacks. 
 During the vehicular assault, SCDF paramedics and firefighters were also brought in to help rescue the injured civilians and contain the fire after the vehicle exploded. 
 Assistant Commissioner of Police Jeremy Ang said strong deployment exercises are important for the officers to train hard, as well as to achieve terrain familiarity and improve coordination.
 Staff of Pontiac Land Group, which owns Millenia Singapore and co-organised the exercise, were roped in as actors. 
 Past iterations of the exercise were held at a shopping mall, university campus and in Sentosa.
 Speaking to the media after the exercise, Ms Sun said: "We have recreated the scenario which is most likely and able to happen in Singapore. We must remember that terrorist attacks in Singapore could be a situation of not 'if', but 'when'."
 "We have to make sure that all stakeholders and members of the public are ever-ready for such situations," she added.

How war-resilient will Israel's economy be this time'

Body


LONDON  The war in Gaza could cost Israel about 10 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), one of the country's senior economic experts has revealed.
 In an interview on Nov 20 with Globes, Israel's leading financial daily newspaper, National Economic Council chairman Avi Simhon said that although Israeli decision-makers do not know how long the war will last, he accepted "the assessment that if negative but possible scenarios materialise", the Gaza war could cost the Israeli economy 200 billion shekels, the equivalent of S$72 billion.
 The chief of the National Economic Council, which provides economic analyses to the Jewish state's government, admitted that the Israeli economy "has been hit", but said the world's rating agencies -- whose assessments ultimately decide the price countries pay for borrowing on international markets -- would remain bullish about Israel.
 "I know that the rating agencies know that the economy is very strong. I talk to them regularly," he added. 
 The rating agencies are nowhere near as optimistic. 
 S&P -- regarded as the largest in the sector -- cut Israel's credit outlook from stable to negative. Both Moody's and Fitch have done the same.
 Still, Israel appears to have had no trouble in borrowing an estimated US$6 billion (S$8 billion) on world markets since Oct 7, when Palestinian militant organisation Hamas mounted a deadly attack in which more than 1,200 Israelis perished.
 Although the Israeli Treasury had to pay higher interest rates to international lenders, the country's credit rating remains similar to that of South Korea, indicating that -- at least for the moment -- investors are not too troubled about Israel's economic prospects.
 The Israeli economy is famously resilient to wars. Despite seven major military confrontations since 2000, the economy has grown by an annual average of 4.2 per cent in real terms.
 Much of this is due to the country's small manufacturing base -- Israel's prosperity depends on its high-tech industry, which provides half the export revenue. Eighty per cent of the country's workforce is employed in the services sector.
 As a result, the bounce-back from wars tended to be fast, mainly since Israel's domestic economic infrastructure remained untouched during previous conflicts.
 However, matters could be different this time.
 The current call-up of reservists to military service is unprecedented in scale: More than 360,000 reservists are now on active duty, representing roughly 9 per cent of Israel's active labour force.
 The real impact on the economy is even bigger, since most reservists now called to duty are young males, precisely the cohort more likely to be employed in the high-tech sector.
 And, given Israel's high birth rate, it's now primarily women who are left to care for children, creating further disruptions to the economy.
 Israel's agriculture has also been gravely affected. The Israeli farms around Gaza destroyed by Hamas in October were responsible for more than 15 per cent of the country's milk production, and fears of a war with the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon have prompted the wholesale evacuation of Israel's north, another source of agricultural produce.
 There are widespread labour shortages. About half of the 9,000 Thai workers employed in Israeli farming and industry have asked to be repatriated after some of the foreign labourers were murdered in the Hamas attack.
 An estimated 140,000 Palestinian Arabs who were employed in various Israeli economic sectors have also been sent home, allegedly for security reasons.
 And then, there are the costs of reconstructing cities and villages hit by Hamas, as well as a far higher defence expenditure.
 At the same time, Israel can count on significant foreign exchange reserves and a relatively low public debt compared with developed countries. Its current debt is around 60 per cent of GDP, compared with 65 per cent for Germany, 100 per cent for Britain and 111 per cent for France. 
 It also can count on massive United States support. President Joe Biden has asked the US Congress to approve an aid package worth US$14.3 billion for Israel, including US$10.6 billion intended for armaments -- more than enough to cover Israel's immediate defence spending.
 The experience Israel gained from managing the Covid-19 pandemic also proved helpful. 
 The country's government rolled out a massive economic assistance programme soon after the Gaza war began, based largely on previous economic stimulus plans during the pandemic.
 Much will ultimately depend on how long the Gaza war lasts. If fighting spreads to Hezbollah in Lebanon, all bets will be off, both about the scope of the fighting and its economic impact.
 Tragically, however, the ultimate economic casualties of this war are still likely to be the Palestinians, who could lose any employment rights in Israel.
 The Israeli government is now looking to replace them with imported labour from India.

Deal remains fragile and carries many strategic risks

LONDON  The Israeli government has accepted a temporary ceasefire agreement with Hamas in Gaza as part of a deal that involves the exchange of hostages held by the armed Islamist movement in return for Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons. 
 After a long overnight meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an agreement on the exchange of 50 Israeli women and children kidnapped by Hamas during a raid on Israel on Oct 7, as well as "a lull in the fighting" for four days.
 According to a senior Israeli official cited by Haaretz, one of the country's leading daily newspapers, all branches of Israel's security services -- the armed forces and the Shin Bet and Mossad intelligence services -- supported the arrangement.
 But one of the Israeli government's most extreme senior ministers voted against the deal with Hamas and, as Israel's military made clear minutes after the agreement was announced, the arrangement promises merely a lull in the war.
 "After the hostage deal is implemented, we will continue dismantling Hamas while respecting humanitarian law on the ground. We will remain vigilant during the pause and use the time to prepare for future operations," Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, the Israel Defence Forces' spokesman, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
 Hamas is estimated to have kidnapped 240 Israeli residents, although the militant group claims it knows of only 210. Many are women, children and older people, and a high number hold dual nationality or are nationals of other countries.
 There is considerable uncertainty over how many are still alive; at least four of those known to have been kidnapped were subsequently confirmed dead by teams of Israeli forensic investigators who came with Israeli troops pushing into Gaza.
 Nor is it obvious how many are held by Hamas. The organisation claims that at least 30 of the Israeli hostages are in the hands of Islamic Jihad -- another Palestinian militant faction -- and a further handful could be in the hands of individual Gaza gunmen who penetrated Israel in October.
 Intense negotiations for their release started soon after the Hamas attack on Oct 7 and were led by the Gulf state of Qatar, which often serves as an intermediary between Israel, the United States, and Hamas.
 The outlines of a deal have been known for at least a week. Still, the Israeli Cabinet hesitated to approve it, partly because the number of hostages Hamas initially offered to release was deemed too low, and also because Hamas' demand for a ceasefire was regarded as too lengthy by Israeli security officials.
 The Israelis say Hamas' promise to free 50 hostages is an improvement on previous offers.
 Israeli officials also claim that the price the Jewish state has to pay -- the release of 150 Palestinians detained in Israeli jails, or three Palestinians for every Israeli hostage -- is acceptable since all the freed Palestinian detainees will be women and minors currently under arrest in Israel. None of those convicted of murder by Israeli courts will be let out.
 The prisoner exchange is not due to start until Nov 23 to allow ordinary Israelis to file petitions with the country's Supreme Court, objecting to the release of any specific Palestinian detainee.
 These safeguards are supposed to protect Mr Netanyahu from accusations that he has given in to the men of violence.
 Still, the deal remains fragile and carries many strategic risks for Israel.
 The first and most apparent risk is that regardless of what it says now, it would be difficult for Israel to resume hostilities next week, with all the bloodshed of ordinary Palestinians that such a military offensive entails.
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is already scheduled to arrive in the region early next week to discuss a more prolonged ceasefire, which Israel objects to since it wants to continue in what it claims is its objective of "destroying" Hamas.
 Hamas will also use this lull to regroup and is sure to try every opportunity to extend the ceasefire since its top leadership remains untouched, and the organisation can, therefore, still plausibly claim to have won this latest round of confrontation with Israel, should the fighting stop now.
 Hamas may taunt Israel by using a provision in the current deal, under which the ceasefire can be automatically extended by one day for each additional 10 Israeli hostages it frees after the first 50 are released.
 The Palestinian organisation is sure to use this mechanism to force the Israeli government either to abandon its current military offensive or, if Israel resumes hostilities, to blame Israel for the potential death of any remaining hostages.
 A psychological war between Hamas and Israel is, therefore, guaranteed to unfold.
 And while the guns may temporarily fall silent in Gaza, tensions are rising fast on Israel's border with Lebanon, where the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia is now trading daily firefights with Israeli forces.
 But the most significant danger to Mr Netanyahu remains a domestic one: He is being criticised by the more extreme members of his Cabinet for allegedly betraying Israeli interests.
 National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, a far-right extremist who has often called for the wholesale expulsion of Palestinians, has slammed the prisoner exchange deal as one doomed to end in "disaster" for the Jewish state.
