Ceasefire between Israel and Hamas comes into effect ahead of expected Gaza hostage release;"group of Israeli hostages held by the militant Islamist organisation in return for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
Underlining the fragility of the four day pause in hostilities, an alert sounded in Israel at 7.15am local time warning of a possible incoming rocket from Gaza targeting a village in southern Israel.
The diplomatic breakthrough , delayed by 24 hours, marks the first pause in seven weeks of war in Gaza and offers some relief both for the 2.3 million Palestinians in the territory who have endured intensive Israeli bombardment, and for families in Israel fearful for the fate of their loved ones taken captive during the bloody attack launched last month by Hamas that triggered the conflict.
Officials in Qatar, which has played a key role as an intermediary, said an operations room there will monitor the truce and the release of hostages from Gaza. They have direct and real-time lines of communication with Israel, the Hamas political office in Doha and the ICRC, Majed al-Ansari, the spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry, Ansari said.
The truce, initially lasting four or five days, was announced early on Wednesday  after days of speculation and has raised hopes for a more durable pause in the violence.
Ansari said the two sides had exchanged lists of those to be released, and the first group of hostages held by Hamas – 13 women and children – would be freed on Friday afternoon. Ansari did not specify how many Palestinian women and children will be released on Friday or when this would take place.
Increased aid for Palestinians would start to enter “as soon as possible”, Ansari said.
Under the agreement, Hamas will free at least 50 of the more than 240 mostly Israeli hostages  it has held since launching bloody attacks into southern Israel on 7 October. In turn, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza which has endured heavy fighting and a crippling blockade of fuel, food, medicine and other essentials.
The exchange of female and child hostages and prisoners was due to take place on Thursday but was postponed as last-minute logistical issues were worked out during 24 hours of frantic diplomacy.
Sources close to the negotiations said Israel  had presented a series of late requests for clarification of practical issues, and demanded the full identification of the hostages Hamas intended to release. Communication between the parties has to pass from Israeli officials to Qatar, then to Hamas  leaders outside Gaza and finally those inside the territory, a process that slowed any resolution of outstanding issues, the sources said.
The senior Israeli official in charge of arrangements for the hostage release, Brig Gen Gal Hirsch, confirmed Israel had received a list of the names of the hostages to be freed. “Liaison officers have informed all of those families whose loved ones appear on the list, as well as all of the hostages’ families,” Hirsch said.
Reports in Israel  suggest the hostages will be released across the Rafah border crossing into Egypt and then be brought to Israel by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent (ICRC).
The agreement includes a halt to Israeli military flights over southern Gaza , with air activity over northern Gaza restricted to six hours a day. Israel has agreed not to arrest anyone in Gaza for the duration of the truce, according to a Hamas statement.
Hamas is understood to be particularly concerned by the prospect of surveillance by drones during the release of hostages, a process that would expose their militants and potentially some of their infrastructure or even whereabouts of key leaders.
The hostages to be freed are women and children, and the Palestinian prisoners are also women and children, both sides have confirmed.
If the first exchanges go well, and Hamas can locate more female hostages or children, there will be further releases on both sides, reports suggest. Some sources have suggested the ceasefire could run for up to 10 days.
The deal, struck after lengthy and complex talks mediated by Qatar , the US and Egypt, comes more than six weeks after the conflict began last month. At least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October, and more than 240 people taken hostage.
The Israeli offensive has killed between 13,000 and 14,000 people, thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials. More are thought to be under rubble. Swaths of northern Gaza have been destroyed in the fighting, and up to a million people displaced.
Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas fighters, without presenting evidence for its count.
Fighting on Thursday had continued at even greater than normal intensity, with Israeli jets hitting more than 300 targets and troops engaged in heavy clashes around Jabalia refugee camp north of Gaza City.
NGOs working with Palestinian prisoners said the arrangements for their release from Israeli jails was unclear even as late as Thursday evening, with continuing discussions about where they would be freed by Israeli authorities.
The prisoners to be freed are understood to come from across the occupied West Bank.
Though the deal has raised hopes of a more durable cessation of hostilities, Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed it will be temporary and will not end the campaign to destroy Hamas. 
The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said during a visit to a naval base on Thursday: “This will be a short respite, at the end of which the fighting will continue intensely, and we will create pressure to bring back more hostages. At least another two months of fighting is expected.”";964 words

The UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has thanked Qatar and Egypt for their “intensive diplomacy” in helping to secure the pause in the fighting in Gaza.
The temporary truce came into effect early on Friday, setting the stage for the exchange of dozens of hostages held by militants in Gaza for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. 
Sunak tweeted: “This humanitarian pause is critical to end the terrible ordeal of hostages held by Hamas and get life-saving aid into Gaza.
“I want to thank Qatar, Egypt and others for the intensive diplomacy that has got us here. We will not stop until all hostages are safely returned.”

Advanced plans by Saudi Arabia  to strike a peace deal with the Houthi rebels in Yemen are being jeopardised by Houthi attacks on Israel and this week’s seizure of an Israeli-linked commercial vessel in the Red Sea.
Saudi Arabia hopes it can maintain a firewall between the Yemen peace talks and the Houthis’ attacks on Israel , but in London and Washington there is pressure to redesignate the Houthis as a terrorist organisation, which would threaten any deal.
There are also reports that the US is willing to launch an attack on Houthi military sites in and around Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, as well as its port operations room, unless the ship seized on Sunday , the Galaxy Leader, is released.
Last week the Saudis summoned the official UN-recognised Yemen  government for further talks in Riyadh to present a revised roadmap that would lead to foreign forces, including those from Saudi Arabia, leaving in six months. It includes a budget deal under which large sums would be transferred from the oil-rich south to the impoverished north, which is dominated by the Iranian-backed Houthis.
Critics of the deal claim it empowers the Houthis, but Saudi Arabia, eager to exit what has proved to be an ill-judged military intervention in Yemen’s civil war, wants to end its engagement as quickly as possible.

Britain will provide a further £30m ($37.38m) of humanitarian aid to Gaza, the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, has said as he travels to the occupied Palestinian territories on the second day of his visit to the region.
Cameron will meet Palestinian leaders and aid agencies.
On Thursday, he met the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , during which he expressed hope that the truce with Hamas would be an “opportunity to crucially get hostages out and get aid into Gaza”.
In a statement  on Friday, Cameron said:
We are hopeful that today will see the release of hostages, and I am urging all parties to continue to work towards the release of every hostage. A pause will also allow access for life-saving aid to the people of Gaza.
I am proud that a fourth UK flight carrying critical supplies landed in Egypt today, and I can announce new £30m of funding which will be spent on vital aid such as shelter and medical provisions.
It is vital to protect civilians from harm, and we are urgently looking at all avenues to get aid into Gaza, including land, maritime and air routes. The new pledge will double the amount of additional aid Britain has committed to Gaza since the conflict began in October.

The hostage release is due to start at 4pm, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz has reported , without citing a source.
It’s not clear who will be in the first batch to be released but there have been lots of reports about the possibility of Avigail Idan, an American child who turns four on Friday, being among them.
When asked about the possibility of her being among those released, the US president, Joe Biden, said: “I’m keeping my fingers crossed.”
Avigail was kidnapped from kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October during the Hamas attack on southern Israel , according to the Jerusalem Post.  Her parents, Roee and Smadar Idan, were killed while her two older sibilings survived by hiding in closets.
No soldiers are expected to be among the women released.

 Truce officially in place but sirens sound in southern Israel  
Around 40 minutes into the truce it’s difficult to say whether it’s holding. The Israeli military (IDF) said sirens warning of potential incoming rockets had sounded in two Israeli communities near Gaza but there was no immediate confirmation that attacks had occurred or of any damage or casualties.
A CNN team in the southern Israel city of Sderot meanwhile reported “loud booms” that sounded like Israeli artillery fire landing in Gaza, up to 15 minutes after the ceasefire was meant to be in place. Smoke was also continuing to rise from Gaza, the source of which was unknown, the team said.
Hostilities appeared to have continued up until the last moment, with Israeli forces reportedly attacking the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza overnight, as well as striking a residential building in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza.
A BBC reporter also in Sderot noted an Israeli airstrike as well the sound of small arms fires, drones and mortars with less than an hour to go before the truce.

Our correspondent Jason Burke has interviewed Dr Paul Ley, a French orthopaedic surgeon at the European hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, where conditions are dire. Here’s an excerpt from his story:
Ley said the hardest thing for doctors was to make triage decisions. “We do our triage … [asking] are we going to take this patient because they will have a good chance of surviving rather than doing desperate measures on a patient who will die in two or three days? That sounds nice on paper, but when you have to make the decision it is different. There’s a 12-year-old with 90% burns so we won’t treat him except for pain control that is not enough,” he said.
“We try to keep our heads cool and steady, but for local staff this is their families, friends, their people. They never want to amputate. They say: ‘I can’t do it any more’ and so I say: ‘OK I will do it, don’t worry,’ and you can feel the relief”.
Ley said he had been shocked at how passive many patients were, such as one 35-year-old woman whose husband and children had been killed when the family’s home was destroyed, and who appeared unmoved when told both her legs would need to be amputated. “So many just don’t care any more,” he said.

 Israeli forces raid Indonesian hospital, Al Jazeera reports  
One woman has been killed and three others wounded after Israeli forces raided the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza, Al Jazeera is reporting, citing Dr Munir al-Bursh, the director general of the Hamas-run ministry of health in Gaza.
Another three people were arrested at the hospital, which has been forced to cease operations. As of Thursday, there were an estimated 550 patients remaining at the hospital, as well as 200 medical workers and at least 1,500 displaced Palestinians sheltering at the hospital, according to Al Jazeera.
Dr Sarbini Abdul Murad, head of the Indonesian charity Medical Emergency Rescue Committee (MER-C), which helped fund the hospital’s construction told Al Jazeera the attack on the medical facility overnight had caused extensive damage. Speaking from Jakarta, he said:
Last night, Israeli forces attacked the hospital with tanks and destroyed all of the first floor. The damage was very bad.
Previously, they had attacked the third floor. They arrested at least three people. This is their way of taking over the hospitals before the ceasefire today.
Israeli forces surrounded the Indonesian hospital with tanks earlier this week, with doctors reporting that staff and patients were terrified. Here’s an explainer written earlier this week on the situation at the hospital:

More Palestinian people, including women, were detained by Israeli forces as they tried to move south on Thursday compared to previous days, a monitoring team belonging to the UN’s humanitarian agency (OCHA) has reported. 
In its latest update  on the conflict, OCHA said that the team had documented family accounts of women being detained for hours or even days before being released. There were also cases of unaccompanied children and separated families moving south.
Israeli forces have been arresting some people as they move down the main traffic artery between north and south, Salah Ad Deen road, which has been designated a “corridor” by Israel, which has been urging people to leave the north, OCHA reported. It added:
IDPs [internally displaced persons] interviewed by OCHA reported that Israeli forces had established an unstaffed checkpoint where people are directed from a distance to pass through two structures, where a surveillance system is thought to be installed. 
IDPs are ordered to show their IDs and undergo what appears to be a facial recognition scan.

 Whole world 'shocked' at images coming from Gaza, Spanish PM tells Netanyahu  
Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez , has urged Israel to rethink its offensive in Gaza, telling its president and prime minister the number of dead Palestinians is “truly unbearable”, and that the response to Hamas’s terrorist attacks last month cannot include “the deaths of innocent civilians, including thousands of children”.
Sánchez’s blunt pleas came during a visit to the Middle East with the Belgian prime minister, Alexander de Croo, during which he called for a peace conference and reiterated that the creation of a Palestinian state remained the best way to bring peace and security to the region.
Speaking as he met Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday afternoon, Sánchez said Spain  had repeatedly condemned Hamas’s “shocking acts of terrorism” and acknowledged Israel’s right to defend itself.
But he added: “Let me also be clear: Israel must abide by international law, including international humanitarian law, in its response … The whole world is shocked at the images that we see coming from Gaza  every day. The number of Palestinians killed is truly unbearable. I believe that all civilians must be protected at all costs.”
Sánchez said “a serious and credible prospect for peace” was more necessary than ever. “Without a political settlement, we are bound to run again into a never-ending cycle of violence.”

Ziad, a 35-year-old Palestinian in Gaza, has been keeping a diary for the Guardian. In case you missed the latest instalment, here’s an excerpt:
I am walking with Ahmad when we pass a bombed house. The house has collapsed and looks like a pile of giant Lego pieces. The surprising part is that there is one part of the house that is still perfectly fine – the kitchen and the room next to it on the second floor fell in one piece over the rubble. Even the kitchen sink is perfectly fine.
I stop for a while to look at the scene and think of the owners and how they would feel every time they pass by. I bet there have been a lot of happy moments in that kitchen, cooking meals for family gatherings, and maybe gossiping about what’s happening. The next room could be a playroom for the children or maybe a teenager lying on their bed thinking of their crush. 
Then it hits me: did the residents of the house make it out alive? Or were they sleeping when it happened?

‘Praying to hear good news’: hopes rise that Thai hostages in Gaza could be freed;"Hopes have risen that 23 Thai nationals being held hostage in Gaza could return home after it was reported they are set to be released by Hamas without conditions.
Thai officials are yet to confirm the development, which was reported by Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news site on Friday.
At least 26 Thai nationals are being held by Hamas, while 39 Thai nationals have been killed, according to Thai officials. Three people remain in hospital.
Thousands of Thais worked in Israel’s agricultural sector prior to 7 October, and the Israeli government has said they make up the biggest group of foreign people killed or missing in the Hamas attacks. 
The purported release is not related to the recent deal reached by Israel and Hamas  to hand over dozens of Israeli hostages as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, the report by Al-Araby Al-Jadeed said.
Over recent weeks, Thai government representatives have met officials in Qatar and Egypt, and last month travelled to Tehran to hold talks with Hamas in an effort to secure hostages’ release.
Areepen Uttarasin, a lead negotiator, said at the time that he had stressed the innocence of Thai nationals, and had been assured that they were being looked after.
Neighbouring Malaysia, which is a vocal supporter of Palestine and does not have diplomatic relations with Israel, has also taken part in the effort to get the Thai hostages released. 
Sunan Chombua, whose son Komkrit Chombua, 29, was among those abducted, said he felt hopeful, but that no update had been given by Thai officials.
“Me and my wife are praying to hear good news,” he said. He had not received any communication from the Thai government, even after it was reported earlier this week that a deal had been reached by Israel and Hamas to release 50 hostages during a 4-day ceasefire, he said. “It’s quiet, no update. I haven’t had any update about my son, even from his friends or anywhere else.”
Komkrit, from Surin province, moved from his home in rural Thailand four years ago to work in Israel, and was initially employed in agriculture and later construction. He would send money back home to his family, and his wages helped his parents to build a new home.
On 7 October, a photograph shared online showed Komkri sitting on the floor, head bowed, among a group of hostages taken by Hamas.
Sunan said he was waiting for more information. “I wish they could release all Thai hostages,” he said.
Prior to the war, 30,000 Thai workers were employed in Israel, with about 5,000 working in areas close to the Gaza Strip. Many Thais move from poorer, rural areas of Thailand to work Israel, where the wages are several times higher.
Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it welcomed deal that was agreed between Israel and Hamas earlier this week that will allow for the release of 50 women and children hostages held in Gaza in return for 150 Palestinian women and children who would be freed from Israeli jails during a four-day ceasefire.
“Thailand fervently hopes that this momentum can be maintained so that the remaining hostages, which include Thai nationals, are released at the earliest opportunity. Thailand reiterates our strong call toward that end,” the ministry said.
Kanchana Patarachoke, spokesperson for Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs, said on Thursday that Thailand had not receive any information regarding whether Thais would be released as part of the deal struck between Israel and Hamas, the Bangkok Post reported.
There is only one woman among the Thai hostages, Kanchana said.";585 words
