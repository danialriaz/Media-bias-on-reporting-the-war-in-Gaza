'I've lost contact': Surviving Israeli bombs amid communications blackout

October 30th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Maghazi, Gaza Strip — It was about six o'clock in the evening last Friday when all of   with the outside world and with each other within the besieged enclave.
My family, along with my uncle's family, were gathered in a single room at his house in the Maghazi camp. We had evacuated our home in the western part and moved to southern Gaza as per Israeli orders. Israel, of course, claims its orders for us to leave are for our safety, but as a survivor of its barbaric aggression on Gaza, I can tell you that the pretence of relative safety in south Gaza is a myth.
The reason we gather in a single room is simple: if we are subjected to bombings and, God forbid, we lose our lives, we do so together. None of us wishes for the other to endure the pain of sorrow alone.
As is my routine, I reached for my laptop that evening to make sure its battery was charged to the fullest extent possible, enabling me to carry on with my work as a journalist. Just moments before, I was engaged in a conversation with a Canadian journalist, discussing the dire circumstances in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, my father was on the phone with my brother Adham, who resides in the United States, trying to reassure him about our safety.
In the same room, my cousin Reem diligently reads the news she follows on Telegram, providing us with updates on the locations that have come under attack in and around the Gaza Strip, so we reach out to our loved ones residing in those areas.
In another corner, my younger brother, who is just 13 years old, is playing with my cousin's son, Hammoud, who will be turning two next month.
Then, abruptly, my internet connection dropped, and I asked in a shaky voice, "Is there an issue with the internet?" At the very same moment, my father said, "I've lost contact with Adham," and my uncle added, "I have no phone signal whatsoever!"
We were left with only the radio as our means of communication. When we switched on the radio and heard the announcer from Al Jazeera radio reporting that Israel had severed communications and internet access throughout the Gaza Strip, we were all left in shock and silence. We began to contemplate Israel's motives behind isolating us from the rest of the world.
Among us, there were those who believed that they aimed to isolate us in order to   away from the scrutiny of the international community. Some even wondered if it might be our final night alive.
We exchanged glances with one another, saying silent farewells.
My thoughts were consumed by concern for my friends outside of Gaza, imagining the anguish they must be feeling with no means to receive updates about my safety. My worry extended to my relatives who had opted to remain in Gaza's more precarious regions, refusing to relocate to the south. The weight of my responsibilities as a journalist weighed heavily on my mind, knowing that I was powerless to convey the truth to the rest of the world due to the blackout and loss of internet connectivity. I couldn't fathom a more agonising feeling than the overwhelming combination of helplessness and fear that engulfed me.
We turned to the Quran, seeking solace for our souls, and we recited prayers, beseeching God to protect us, our homes, and our cherished ones.
Sleeping that night was an impossibility as the artillery shelling continued relentlessly, without a moment of respite. Fragments from the explosions even reached our house's garden. The sounds of the missiles were nothing short of terrifying, but what was even more chilling was our complete lack of knowledge regarding who the targets were and who had fallen victim to this senseless violence.
From the very first day of the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, we depended on an LED light. As time passed, the darkness grew more oppressive, and our light grew dimmer as we struggled to recharge the battery that powered our LED.
Try and fathom this: Complete darkness, ceaseless artillery and ground bombardment, isolation from our relatives and friends, and disconnection from the entire world.
That night was the longest in my life, marked by our abrupt isolation from the world. It followed heavy bombings in the Maghazi area, an area far from the parts of Gaza that Israel has warned us to vacate.
The day before this tragedy, before communications and internet access were severed, occupation planes bombed my relatives' house in the Maghazi refugee camp, resulting in the loss of nine lives, including seven children.
Those fleeing in fear through the streets were my own relatives. Among them was an elderly mother, who had lost her son, daughter-in-law, and her grandchildren. She is a kind woman whom I hold dear. I used to see her laughing and would listen to her stories from my childhood.
My brother Karam, who had just enrolled in a doctoral programme in accounting in Gazaa few days before the Israeli aggression on Gaza, was the one who transported the injured in his private car. Today, both universities have been reduced to rubble on the ground.
On the night of Thursday, October 26, the Israeli occupation targeted the sole bakery in the Maghazi camp, adding to the grim tally of more than 11 bakeries bombed across the Gaza Strip during this aggression. It is evident that Israel's strategy in this war is one of extermination and starvation.
During this particular attack, I hastily grabbed my evacuation bag, which contained only my passport and identity card, preparing to flee once again. However, this time, I was uncertain of where I could seek refuge.
Tragically, the bombing of the bakery resulted in the loss of approximately 10 innocent civilians. Furthermore, the debris from the attack reached an UNRWA school housing about 6,000 displaced Palestinians from northern Gaza, causing the killing of one person at the school who was injured by stones propelled by the bakery's blast.
This is just a small glimpse into the illusion of "safety" that Israel claims to offer in the southern Gaza Strip.
When Gaza finally regained internet connectivity, I didn't experience the  . Instead, I was overwhelmed by a sense of dread. I immediately reached for my mobile phone to check on my friends and relatives, fearing that they might have been injured or worse. I had reason to fear: On October 22, in a horrifying Israeli air raid targeting his home, my colleague, the aspiring translator, Mahmoud, had tragically lost his life. His entire family were mercilessly killed – his father, his brother, his sisters, and their children.
I turned to my X account, formerly Twitter, to catch up on the events in Gaza during the two days that I was  , reading tweets from friends describing the horrors they endured during the relentless bombings.
I was desperate to learn about the political developments and the extent of the devastation in Gaza, hoping to hear any news of a ceasefire and an end to the relentless massacres against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, all while Israel continued its aggression without being held accountable. It was disheartening to hear that the brutality of the bombing persisted, and there was no indication of a resolution in sight.
The world may never grasp the heart-wrenching reality of queueing for nearly four arduous hours, just to obtain a $2 worth of bread, only to have the bakery reduced to rubble by a bombing. In the face of such adversity, you are compelled to resort to primitive methods, like using wood to ignite a fire, just to provide bread for more than 50 individuals huddled together in a modest, two-storey building.
The desperate struggle to secure even a minimal quantity of drinking water, just for the sake of survival, is a hardship few can understand.
And the agony of isolation from the rest of the world, amidst the relentless onslaught of Israeli artillery, naval, and aerial bombardments, is an experience beyond imagination.

'We are minutes away from death': Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital under attack

November 11th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel's military has brought the war to the front gates of  , Gaza's biggest hospital complex, where thousands of injured and displaced people are trapped amid ferocious bombardment.
"We are minutes away from imminent death," Muhammad Abu Salmiya, al-Shifa Hospital's director told Al Jazeera from inside the besieged facility on Saturday, where operations had to be suspended after it ran out of power and fuel.
Abu Salmiya said al-Shifa's buildings are being targeted and any person moving within the hospital compound is being attacked by Israeli forces.
"One member of a medical crew who tried to reach the incubator to lend a helping hand to the babies born inside was shot and killed," he said. "We lost a baby in the incubator, we also lost a young man in the intensive care unit."
Gaza Deputy Health Minister Dr Youssef Abu al-Reesh, who is currently inside al-Shifa Hospital told Al Jazeera that all generators are off and all power sources are now out in the hospital.
"We have 39 newborns in the incubators, those babies are fighting against death."
He also said snipers were stationed around the compound and people inside were unable to move around freely.
"Ferocious gunfire can be heard within the vicinity of the hospital, the intensive care unit received a mortar shell a few minutes ago … Blood is everywhere, on the floor, we cannot even clean it," he added.
'War crime'
Located in the northern Rimal neighbourhood, close to the port, al-Shifa became a hospital in 1946, undergoing successive expansions. The facility has become a lifeline for people seeking urgent medical intervention.
Thousands of people who have lost their homes in Israel's continuing bombardment are also living in the hospital corridors and courtyard.
Israel claims al-Shifa provides cover for a Hamas command centre, an accusation the hospital's director has rejected as 'utter lies'. Hamas also rejects the claims, saying the facility is sheltering more than  .
Al Jazeera's diplomatic correspondent James Bays said that none of the doctors or staff have reported seeing Hamas members in the hospital for years.
Bays added that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, who is visiting the region, has said that even if there was such conduct by the Palestinian armed group below the hospital, Israel has an obligation to ensure that civilians are spared and the principles of human rights are respected. Failure to do so would be a contravention of the laws of war.
"So that's the top human rights official saying that targeting a hospital is a war crime," Bays noted.
(Al Jazeera)
'We cannot bury our dead'
Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French name Medecins Sans Frontieres or MSF, supplied al-Shifa with the medicines and equipment that it still has in its stock. Early on Saturday, the NGO posted on X  that it was unable to contact its staff inside the hospital and was "extremely concerned" about the patients and medics.
Fabrizio Carboni, the Red Cross's Regional Director for Near and Middle East, said  the information coming out of al-Shifa was "distressing", adding that the thousands of people in the compound "need to be protected in line with the laws of war".
Speaking from inside the hospital on Saturday, deputy health minister in Gaza, Monir al-Bashr, said that people were being forced to dig with their hands in order to bury bodies within the hospital compound.
"We are surrounded, we cannot bury our dead. We are going to create a mass grave within the hospital compound," he told Al Jazeera,
'We do not have any equipment or machinery to dig the grave. We have to bury these bodies otherwise epidemics will break out. These bodies have been lying on the street for days."
As the fighting intensifies just by the front gate of the hospital, for Abu Salmiya, the hospital's director, the outlook is bleak.
"We are totally cut off from the whole world … We are stranded, we sent many SOS to the whole world - there has been no response, no response," he said.

What to know about the deadly Hamas attack on an Israeli music festival

On Saturday, thousands witnessed a massacre at an Israeli   where Hamas fighters killed at least 260 people and took captives back into Gaza.
Here is what to know:
What happened and when?
About 3,500 young people attended the Supernova music festival, which became one of the first targets of Palestinian gunmen who breached Gaza's border fence early on Saturday from Gaza.
Video footage circulating on social media showed the gunmen descending in paragliders on the gathering. Others came by road.
Dozens of Hamas fighters opened fire on the young Israelis who had come together for a night of electronic music to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.
Videos compiled by Israeli first responders and posted to the social media site Telegram show armed men plunging into the panicked crowd, mowing down fleeing revellers with bursts of automatic fire.
Many victims were shot in the back as they ran.
While rockets rained down, revellers said, fighters converged on the festival site while others waited near bomb shelters, gunning down people who were seeking refuge.
Saturday's attack is believed to be the worst civilian massacre in Israeli history.

Where did it happen?
The party was held in a dusty field outside the Re'im kibbutz, about 3.3 miles (5.3 kilometres) from the wall that separates Gaza from southern Israel.
How many casualties?
Israeli emergency services said 260 bodies had been recovered from the site of the festival.
But festival organisers said they were helping Israeli security forces locate attendees who were still missing. The death toll could rise as teams continue to clear the area.

What else do we know about the Hamas fighters behind it?
Many of the fighters, who also arrived in trucks and on motorcycles, were wearing body armour and brandishing AK-47 assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.

What are victims saying?
'We were hiding and running, hiding and running, in an open field – the worst place you could possibly be in that situation,' said Arik Nani from Tel Aviv, who had gone to the party to celebrate his 26th birthday.
'For a country where everyone in these circles knows everyone, this is a trauma like I could never imagine,' Maya Alper, 25, told the Associated Press.
'I can't even explain the energy they (the militants) had. It was so clear they didn't see us as human beings,' she said. 'They looked at us with pure, pure hate.'
Elad Hakim, who escaped in a speeding car with companions, said he "was certain that we were being kidnapped".
"I wrote to my parents, I sent my friend a recording for him to tell my parents that I didn't suffer and that it was… that it will be OK."
Zohar Maariv, 23, who lives on the Gaza border said she felt "this was the end" during the attack.
"I live on the Gaza border and I've seen things in my life, but I've never felt it this close," Maariv said, who had to jump out of the car she was escaping in when it came under fire from two sides.
"I have never felt so close to death," she added.

Israeli army says it found a 55-metre tunnel under Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital

The Israeli army claims it has uncovered a tunnel shaft under the beleaguered al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza.
In a statement on Sunday, the army said it found a 55-metre-long (180 ft), 10-metre-deep (32 ft) tunnel under Gaza's  , which has been under siege by Israeli troops for several days.
The army published a video on its official Telegram channel showing a soldier lowering himself into the tunnel. The footage was shot with two separate cameras on November 17, it said.
The videos show a staircase leading to an arched concrete passage that ends in what appears to be a door. The army says it is the entrance of the tunnel shaft with 'a blast-proof door and a firing hole'.
According to the statement, the tunnel was found 'in the area of the hospital underneath a shed alongside a vehicle containing numerous weapons including RPGs, explosives, and Kalashnikov rifles'.

Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters the entrance was uncovered when a military bulldozer knocked down the outside wall of the hospital complex and found a fortified shaft with a spiral staircase descending 10 metres.
"It's a huge one which has metal [spiral] stairs, then it goes along for 55 metres… and reaches a blast door," said Hagari, indicating that troops had not yet tried to open the door for fear it would be booby-trapped.
Beyond the door, intelligence suggested either the tunnel would split or there would be "a big room for command and control", he added, saying troops would continue searching the area as there could be access shafts from nearby houses.
Israel has made al-Shifa Hospital a focal point of its operations since the army entered it on Wednesday, claiming it harbours a Hamas command centre – a claim Hamas as well as staff working at the hospital have denied.
"It's probably one out of dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of tunnels. We all know there are tunnels in Gaza," Al Jazeera's senior political analyst Marwan Bishara said.
"The problem is not finding a tunnel. The problem is the Israeli excuse – and their supporters in London and Washington too – that there was 'a city under a city'."

The Israeli army on Sunday also said that a captive soldier was executed and two foreign captives held at al-Shifa Hospital. The army is searching for some 240 people Hamas kidnapped to Gaza after the October 7 cross-border assault.
One of the hostages was a 19-year-old Israeli army conscript, Noa Marciano, whose body was recovered near al-Shifa last week. Hamas said she died in an Israeli air strike and issued a video that appeared to show her corpse, unmarked except for a head wound.
The Israeli military said a forensic examination found she had sustained non-life-threatening injuries from such a strike.
"According to intelligence information – solid intelligence information – Noa was taken by Hamas terrorists inside the walls of Shifa hospital. There, she was murdered by a Hamas terrorist," Hagari said without elaborating.

In his televised briefing, Hagari said Hamas attackers had also brought a Nepalese and a Thai captive, among foreign workers seized in the October 7 raid, to al-Shifa. He did not name the two hostages.
Hamas did not immediately comment on Hagari's statements. It previously said it took some hostages to hospitals for treatment.
At least 13,000 Palestinians, 5,500 of them children, have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its air and ground assault, the Gaza health ministry said.
The siege of al-Shifa Hospital, the focal point of the six-week "genocide", has sparked international outcry, with the World Health Organization describing it as a "death zone" when its team visited the facility on Saturday.
More than 7,000 people, including patients in critical condition and newborn babies fighting for their lives, were sheltered inside al-Shifa before those who were able to move were forced out this weekend.
Thirty-one premature babies were evacuated on Sunday and taken to the European and Nasser hospitals in the south of the Gaza Strip.
According to reports from medical staff inside al-Shifa, some patients remain at the hospital and were interrogated earlier on Sunday.

Families of Israeli captives arrive in Jerusalem, rally at PM's office

November 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Tens of thousands of protesters have arrived in Jerusalem after a five-day march from Tel Aviv to put pressure on the Israeli government for the immediate release of captives held by Hamas in Gaza.
An estimated 20,000 demonstrators, including family and friends of about 240 captives, held a rally in front of Prime Minister  's office on Saturday. They say the government   their pleas to prioritise bringing their loved ones home.
The marchers walked for hours along the highway connecting the two cities, holding posters of the captives with the slogan 'Bring them home now.'
They want to put   on the government "to do everything they can to bring the hostages back," said Noam Alon, 25, clutching a photograph of his abducted girlfriend, Inbar.
"We are expecting them to meet with us, we are expecting them to tell us how they are going to do it," he told the Reuters news agency. "We cannot wait any longer, so we are demand [ing] them to do that now, to pay any price to bring the hostages back."
The captives were taken during the October 7 attack by the Palestinian group on southern Israel, which also left 1,200 people dead, mostly civilians. Since then, Israel launched a massive aerial and ground offensive on the Gaza Strip, which is under Hamas's control, killing more than 12,000 people, also mostly civilians.
A spokesperson for the Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing, said on Saturday that it has lost contact with some of the groups responsible for the safety of the captives in the Gaza Strip.
"The fate of the captives and those holding them is still unknown after we lost communication with them," he said.
Many relatives and friends of the missing   in Israeli attacks on Gaza designed to destroy Hamas. The government says the offensive improves the chances of recovering hostages by putting pressure on Hamas.
Among those who marched to Jerusalem was centrist opposition leader  , who has been mostly supportive of the war but has demanded Netanyahu's resignation.
Miki Zohar, a member of Netanyahu's cabinet and party, was heckled on Friday when he visited the marchers at a rest stop.

Government 'isn't talking'
Hamas on Monday released a video of the first hostage confirmed to have died in captivity, and earlier said others have been killed.
That has stoked the anxiety of campaigners and relatives calling on the Israeli government to speed up any prisoner swap, and frustration with Netanyahu's insistence that discretion is required around the Qatari- and Egyptian-mediated negotiations.
"It's impossible that there are 240 kidnapped people and the government – our government – isn't talking to [the relatives], isn't telling them what's going on, what's on the table, what's on offer, what are the reasons for and against. Nothing," campaigner Stevie Kerem told Reuters.
Oliver McTernan, who has worked on hostage negation for 20 years, said the families were right to be concerned. The only way to achieve the return of the captives, he said, is a ceasefire of enough duration to move them safely across the battlefield. Israel has said such a move would simply allow Hamas to rearm.
'I think every day that goes on there is a risk — risk with bombings, risk with incursions and whatever — of the civilians, Israeli civilians, dying in Gaza,' McTernan told The Associated Press news agency, adding that that "should be a priority of any government: to ensure their safety and their return to their families'.

The impossibility of a stolen moment as Israeli bombs rain on Gaza

Gaza City – Last night, things were quiet for a few hours.
The constant air attacks seemed to pause and we felt a cautious relief.
We thought perhaps a short ceasefire had been reached, but we didn't have any internet, so we couldn't confirm.
A little later, a cousin managed to catch an internet signal and shouted happily: 'Al-Qassam has released a mother and her children!'
That raised our hopes, too. If Hamas's armed wing had released a hostage and her children to the Israelis, maybe this goodwill gesture would bring about at least a pause in the relentless attacks.
We all rushed to him, huddling around his mobile to see the news ourselves.
Connectivity was still bad, so someone dusted off an old radio and fiddled with its dials until we got some reception, but even the radio station didn't seem to have much news beyond the hostage release.
The mothers uttered sighs of relief and sent up quick prayers that the war might end soon or that a ceasefire would be reached.
With a little more hope and energy in us after this news, we, the mothers, started getting the kids ready for bed.
We set up the mattresses on the floor, making sure to drag them well away from the windows so shattering glass wouldn't hurt our babies if a bomb landed close enough to blow them out. Better safe than sorry.
After the kids fell asleep, we sat a little way away from them, chatting. I think in the back of our minds we were wondering if this calm was a ceasefire or the calm before the storm.
'I don't like it,' said my sister-in-law about the "tense calm" around us.
I didn't say anything, still trying I tried to connect to the internet to see what was going on out there.
'Let's have a coffee,' my sister-in-law said suddenly, probably trying to break the tension, and got up to go into the kitchen.
I followed her in and stood with her as the coffee bubbled. As she poured it into two cups, I rummaged in my bag for some biscuits to share.
We had only had a sip or two when a massive explosion hit, then a second, then the third.
'It's back,' my sister-in-law said, practically tossing her coffee cup on the table next to mine as werushed to check on our kids.
She seemed resigned, frustrated, scared.

The house was shaking so hard, it was actually difficult to keep walking towards where the kids were sleeping.
The thought of all of them being blown out and filling the house with shards of glass was too much, soI told my husband to take all the windows down.
We spent the next few hours in complete darkness as the booming seemed to grow louder by the second. With no internet, we didn't know where the bombs were landing.
I think the internet and power outages were fairly widespread because, even when we caught a bit of internet, there were no updates to be had on messaging groups, no news, no updates.
Eventually, we found out that the bombing was on three civilian neighbourhoods in northwest Gaza: al-Karama, al-Maqosi and al-Mukhabarat.
But for the rest of the night and well into the morning today, the bombing was nonstop.
It was so violent and intense, that I often thought it was on our house. I jumped up more than once to run towards where my infant son was sleeping, ready to grab him and run.
They say no news is good news, but for the people of Gaza under war, no news can spell the end.

Gaza 'hospitals risk turning into morgues': Rights groups call for action

October 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A   in the Gaza Strip caused by Israel's "total blockade" of the besieged enclave has prompted condemnation and calls from international rights groups for urgent action as "hospitals risk turning into morgues" amid heavy Israeli bombardment.
On Wednesday, Gaza's sole power plant ran out of fuel and shut down after Israel's decision to cut off supplies following a multi-pronged attack by Hamas, the group running the enclave, inside Israel.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a medical charity, on Thursday called the escalation "abhorrent", imploring Israel and Hamas "to reduce the suffering of civilians".
"As Gaza loses power, hospitals lose power, putting newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen at risk. Kidney dialysis stops, and X-rays can't be taken. Without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues," Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC's regional director for the Near and Middle East, said in a statement.
"Families in Gaza are already having trouble accessing clean water. No parent wants to be forced to give a thirsty child dirty water," he added.
Israel's bombardment of Gaza following Hamas's attacks on southern Israel has killed  four ICRC staff in the enclave, according to the charity's spokesman.
A representative from al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City on Wednesday said that Israeli authorities have targeted first responders assisting civilians, and appealed to the global community for assistance.
"We are suffering … and the world is not moving a finger. This is an SOS to the whole world … you must help us," he told reporters after it was announced that Gaza's sole power plant has run out of fuel.
Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch, a global rights organisation, said Israeli authorities, the occupying power over Gaza, under international law must ensure that the basic needs of the population are met.
"Instead, they have since 2007 run Gaza as an 'open-air prison', imposing sweeping restrictions on the movement of people and goods. In the wake of the weekend attacks [by Hamas], authorities are now closing those prison walls in further," it said.
It also said Hamas should be brought to justice for the killings of civilians in Israel, "but depriving the entire population of Gaza of electricity and fuel for the actions of individuals is a formof collective punishment".
"Israel's Minister of Energy and Infrastructure has made it clear  the recent Hamas attacks are 'why we decided to stop the flow of water, electricity and fuel'. These tactics are war crimes, as is using starvation as a weapon of war," the HRW said.
But on Thursday, Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz pledged his country would not allow basic resources or humanitarian aid into Gaza until Hamas released the people it seized during its surprise weekend attack.
"Humanitarian aid to Gaza? No electric switch will be turned on, no water tap will be opened and no fuel truck will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home," he said in a statement.
Some 150 Israelis, foreigners and dual nationals were take to the Gaza Strip by Hamas fighters as part of the Saturday attack that killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has in turn launched a relentless air campaign on Gaza, killing more than 1,200 people so far, Palestinian health officials say.

Israel agrees to allow 'minimal' two trucks of fuel a day into Gaza

Israel is allowing two trucks of fuel into Gaza every day to keep the besieged enclave's water and sewage system operational, as its forces continue their air and ground siege of the territory.
Israel's war cabinet said 140,000 litres (37,000 gallons) of fuel could enter every two days after it received a "special request" from the United States.
Israel banned fuel supplies into Gaza when it launched a military campaign in the Strip on October 7. Acute shortages have threatened aid deliveries and communications.
Tzachi Hanegbi, national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the fuel would be used to "operate the sewage and water systems run by UNRWA", the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.
"We took that decision to prevent the spread of epidemics. We don't need epidemics that will harm civilians or our fighters. If there are epidemics, the fighting will stop," he said. Hanegbi described the quantity as 
A US State Department official, offering more details, said Israel had committed to allowing in 120,000 litres (31,700 gallons) of fuel every 48 hours for UNRWA's trucks and other needs like desalinisation of water, sewage pumping and for bakeries and hospitals in the south of Gaza.
An additional 20,000 litres (5,300 gallons) every two days would be allowed in to power generators of telecoms company Paltel, which had warned of an imminent blackout of its cellphone network due to a lack of fuel.
But aid groups have said the fuel ration is far from enough.
Why allow fuel supplies now?
Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera's Rory Challands said: "Tzachi Hanegbi is basically justifying allowing this trickle of fuel in, for a domestic audience, as a way of keeping the military operation going on in Gaza.
"He is saying pandemics, if they break out, would not just affect the population of Gaza but also affect Israeli troops and hurt their fighting ability. And he is also saying that this decision basically gives diplomatic space to Israel to carry on pushing that military offensive."
US officials have been pushing Israel to allow fuel in for some time. After not complying for weeks, "now, Netanyahu's government believes that granting this wish from the US basically means that that criticism is going to start dying down," Challands said.
On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made calls to members of Israel's war cabinet and warned that the fuel shortage risked a humanitarian catastrophe among Gaza's 2.3 million residents, a State Department official said.
But Israeli officials argue that Hamas should release hostages before it eased the pressure on Gaza.
Challands said allowing fuel into Gaza is "incredibly unpopular among the far right" in Israel.
"They feel while the fuel is being given, the captives are not being returned,' he said, noting how Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has said that "there is no sense in giving the enemy humanitarian gifts'.
Andreas Krieg, senior lecturer of security studies at King's College London told Al Jazeera that for Israel, this decision about allowing limited supplies of fuel into Gaza is not really "an act of empathy".
"This is more about them knowing that the clock is ticking," he said.
"They know the international community, especially Western allies of Israel, are increasingly nervous about what Israel is doing. Especially the Biden administration wants to see this is coming to an end somehow."

Biden and Xi expected to meet next month after high-level US-China meetings

US President Joe Biden is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next month following a visit by China's top diplomat to the White House on Friday.
The two leaders will probably meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco in November, an event that brings together world and business leaders.
While the White House would not confirm the Biden-Xi meeting, a readout of a meeting between China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Friday said the two sides were 'working together towards a meeting'.
Xi and Biden have not met since attending the G20 summit in Bali last year.
The Wang and Sullivan talks formed part of a three-day visit to Washington, DC, that saw the foreign minister meet Biden as well as top US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
The two sides had much to discuss including the  , the  and the presidential election in Taiwan early next year.
China has said it is neutral in the Ukraine war but has been accused of propping up Russia's economy in the face of heavy Western sanctions.
In the Middle East, meanwhile, observers hope it could play a more conciliatory role due to its strong ties with Israel and Arab states.
The US is arming both Israel and Ukraine, but it has also historically tried to broker peace deals between Palestine and Israel.
Both countries now find themselves in a position to possibly work together to help de-escalate the situation in Gaza, where Israel has threatened to launch a  .
The point was raised during Biden and Wang's meeting, where the president 'underscored that the United States and China must work together to address global challenges', according to a White House statement.
The two superpowers also discussed how to improve their often-acrimonious relationship, with Wang saying Beijing wants to 'stabilise US-China relations' to 'reduce misunderstanding'.
US officials have also said in the past that both sides need 'guardrails' to ensure disagreements do not escalate into a military skirmish.
The US has accused Beijing's air force of engaging in   while flying over the South China Sea, as seen in a near collision between a US B-52 bomber and a Chinese J-11 jet earlier this week.
During his meeting with Wang Yi, Biden said China must deescalate similar behaviour towards the  , a US treaty ally whose fishing fleet and coast guard vessels are regularly harassed by China in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
As Washington and Beijing potentially work together in the Middle East, they remain at odds over Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy claimed by China's Communist Party as part of its own territory.
The island of 23 million people will hold elections in early January, an event that typically draws an angry response from Beijing.
Beijing has historically tried to influence the results through a range of tactics from online misinformation campaigns to staging military exercises in the Taiwan Strait, an overt reminder that it has not ruled out trying to take the island by force.
Beijing also staged two rounds of exercises over the past 14 months following a visit by then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022 and an unofficial trip by Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen to the US in April.
A military conflict between China and Taiwan could draw in the US, which has pledged to help the democracy defend itself, although it has stopped short of promising boots on the ground.

'Beacon of hope': Amid Gaza war, Indian Muslims take care of synagogues

November 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Kolkata, India – The afternoon sun streams through tall stained-glass windows into the Maghen David Synagogue in the city of Kolkata, the capital of the eastern Indian state of West Bengal.
Anwar Khan, in his starched white uniform, with the name of the synagogue embroidered on his breast pocket, is at work. He puts the ornately polished teakwood chairs with well-kept rattan seats in symmetrical lines. Visitors to the synagogue are rare these days as there are very few Jewish people left in the sprawling city.
But that doesn't dim Khan's diligence or pride in his job. The 44-year-old is the synagogue's chief caretaker. He dusts, sweeps and swabs to keep the temple clean.
Some 4,000km (2,485 miles) away, Israel has been bombing Gaza relentlessly for a month now, killing  . The assault began on October 7 after Hamas fighters entered Israeli territory, killed more than 1,400 people and took more than 200 people captive.
But in the tranquil halls of the Maghen David Synagogue, the Palestine-Israel conflict finds no echo.
'They stand and do their namaz [prayer]. We sit and do our namaz. That is the only difference between us,' says Khan, who since the age of 20 has been a caretaker at the 140-year-old Renaissance-style synagogue on Brabourne Road in Kolkata's busiest business and wholesale market district.
Until about 75 years ago, the synagogues in Kolkata throbbed with life. The first Jews arrived in the city towards the end of the 18th century. Today, the number of synagogues in the bustling city – once the capital of the British empire in the Indian subcontinent – has shrunk from five to three, while the size of the Jewish community is down from more than 5,000 at its peak to just 20.
But there has been one constant for more than two centuries: the caretakers of the synagogues. For generations now, they have come from a village called Kakatpur in Puri district, about 500km (310 miles) south of Kolkata in the neighbouring Odisha state.
And they are  .
Between the three synagogues in the city, there are six Muslim caretakers, all of whom stay on the premises in quarters provided for them and go home occasionally to visit their families. They start work early in the day, cleaning, dusting, polishing and making sure the lights and other electrical devices are in order. They also escort guests and visitors around, something that happens seldom these days.
'Sad that Muslims and Jews are fighting'
It is not as if the Jews of Kolkata or the Muslim caretakers of the synagogues are oblivious to the horrors of the Israel-Hamas war or Israel's bombing of Gaza.
Like many other cities around the world, Kolkata, too, has witnessed pro-Palestinian protests by left-leaning activists and some Muslim groups. Muslims comprise about   of West Bengal, where a political party opposed to the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in power.
But the Muslim caretakers say they have come under no pressure from their families or the community for working at synagogues.
'For me, this [synagogue] is the house of 'Khuda' [God] just like our own 'Khuda ka ghar' [mosque]," says Khan. "It is very sad that Muslims and Jewish people are fighting today in Gaza and Israel. But their house of God is also our house of God. We will take care of it all our life.'

Masood Hussain, 43, is the sole caretaker of Neveh Shalome, Kolkata's oldest synagogue that sits next to Maghen David. He says he goes regularly to a local mosque for prayers, but no one has quizzed him about his Jewish connection.
'We go to our mosque for prayers but no one has said anything, neither the ordinary people nor the religious leaders,' he says.
A college dropout, Hussain came to Kolkata from Odisha 10 years ago, following in the footsteps of his father and father-in-law who also took care of the synagogue. A tall, lean man, who has two college-going daughters back home, Hussain points towards a small exhibition of photos of Kolkata's earliest Jews. He knows their names and their histories by heart.
'Nobody has asked: 'Why do you work for the Jewish people?' No one in my family or community has said: 'Quit your job,'' says Hussain.
'We go to offer namaz at our masjid [mosque]. No one says anything there either. The maulvi [imam] is very friendly. We have tea together. He has never said, 'Masood, why do you do this?' If he says something, I will respond. But I believe all problems should be solved peacefully.'
When asked about the anti-Israel protests in the city, Hussain says there has never been an attack on the synagogues. "And there never will be one, not in Kolkata. The people of Kolkata are very good. But if it happens, we will face it. At worst, what will happen? We will be killed. But this is God's house. For this house of God, we are ready to face anything.
"Till we Muslims are here, we will be the first to confront anyone from our community [who] comes here [to create trouble]. If that happens, we will do a muqabla [resistance]. Nothing will happen to synagogues while we are alive."

Centuries-old bond
The bond across faiths that's visible at the synagogues goes back to the early 1800s, when Neveh Shalome was built At that time, the Jewish community was about 300 strong, and came mostly from Iraq and Iran – the Baghdadi Jews – following the footsteps of wealthy Aleppo-born businessman Shalom Obadiah Cohen, believed to be the first Jew to have arrived in Kolkata, in 1798.
Kolkata, then known as Calcutta, was a coveted destination, where business was brisk for traders in jewels, textiles and, among other items, opium. The Jewish community flourished, along with the Parsis, the Armenians and the Chinese who flocked to the city that was the headquarters of the East India Company.
But with the creation of Israel in 1948, many in Kolkata's Jewish community left. Families moved to Israel, and also to the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, as a newly independent India was convulsing in the aftermath of a bloody partition and devastating communal riots.
Today, of the 20 Jews left in the city, most are more than 70 years old. In all, India today has only an estimated 5,000 Jews, from a high of 30,000.

David Ashkenazy, president of the board that runs Beth El Synagogue, the honorary secretary of Maghen David and a board member at Neveh Shalome, is not sure how Muslims from a village hundreds of kilometres away came to be synagogue caretakers. But he confirms that the job has been passed on from generation to generation.
Khan, the Maghen David caretaker, got the job because his father Khalil Khan and grandfather Ajju Khan were caretakers at Beth El Synagogue and argued his case when he was seeking work.
That Muslim caretakers from another state should form a connection with then-immigrant Jews isn't surprising, suggests Ashkenazy.
'We were both strangers in a new land – the Jews from Baghdad and these Muslims from a village 500km south," he says. "Some of our dietary laws are also similar.'

'I don't even think about it. It is normal. It is natural," says Jael Silliman, a celebrated Kolkata-based Jewish author, painter and women's rights activist, referring to the amity between the city's Muslims and Jews. "We, Baghdadi Jews, lived together with Muslims in the Ottoman Empire and across the Middle East for centuries. We are Arab Jews.'
Silliman cites another example of that Kolkata bond: the city's Jewish Girls' School, founded in 1881, where 90 percent of students are Muslim.
'That, too, is a beacon of hope, like the Muslim caretakers of our synagogues,' she says.
'Muslims natural choice for caretakers'
Initially, in Kolkata, rich Bagdadi Jews would hire Muslims as cooks in their homes, says Navras Jaat Aafreedi, assistant professor of history at Kolkata's Presidency University, where he offers a course in global Jewish history.
'The prominent factors behind Jewish and Muslim amity were no idol worship and similar dietary restrictions,' he says, 'the latter prompting the Baghdadi Jews to employ Muslims as cooks.
'Once the synagogues came up, Muslims were a natural choice for caretakers,' he adds. 'In India, the Arab-Israeli conflict has not dented the historic cordiality between the Jews and Muslims.'

Yet, the ongoing war in Gaza is on the minds of the caretakers.
'Our 'mazhab' [faith] doesn't teach us to hate,' says Sheikh Gufran, the oldest of Maghen David's three caretakers as he meticulously polishes the teak pews of the synagogue.
'Whenever I offer namaz, I pray for the people of all religions suffering in the war [in Gaza and Israel]. Muslims are in pain there. Jews are in pain. I hope their suffering ends soon,' says the 48-year-old.
Ashkenazy hands over some religious books to Gufran and asks him to dust them carefully. The books are old and precious, and need to be handled with care.
It is time for Gufran's prayers too. He steps out of the synagogue, faces west and begins to pray in the courtyard.

'I want to see his body': Nepali dreams turn into Israeli nightmare

Kathmandu, Nepal – Prabesh Bhandari's dream seemed within reach at the age of 24. He wanted to save money to build a house for his family in Salyan district, Nepal. And he had been invited to join a competitive cohort of aspiring agriculture professionals in Israel.
He had calculated that after room and board, he would save close to 1.1 million Nepalese rupees (around $8,275) after a year in Israel. But the unprecedented October 7 attack by the Palestinian armed group Hamas in southern Israel near the Gaza Strip meant that death came to him before his first salary.
'It had been less than a month since he had travelled to Israel and just over three weeks since he had started his work," his aunt Sobha Sejwal told Al Jazeera over the phone.
His relatives say Prabesh left for Israel on September 12 and four days later, was assigned his first task – to pluck and harvest pomelo. On the eve of his death, his parents were waiting in his aunt's house to talk to him, but he was unavailable and later messaged Sejwal: "I am too tired, I came home and did my chores and I dozed off."
On October 7, he and nine other Nepali trainees in the batch of 17 working in the same farm, were dead. Four others were injured and one is still missing. It wasn't until the day after that Prabesh's family heard the news of the attack on the radio. Then, a friend of Prabesh's from Israel called to tell them that he had been killed in the attack.
Sejwal remembers Prabesh as calm, disciplined, and determined.
'He was always the first in his class,' she told Al Jazeera. 'He said he would own a big farm someday and employ all of us.'
Around 4,500 Nepalis reside in Israel as caregivers under nursing duties and around 265 students are pursuing a range of education programmes.
The Nepal Embassy in Tel Aviv has confirmed that 55 Nepali students working on a farm along the Israel-Gaza border have been rescued. Another 72 Nepali students have also been relocated away from the border. Those injured in the attack are being treated even as search operations are ongoing for the missing student.
'His only bad decision was going to Israel'
Rajesh Kumar Swarnakar also didn't survive the Hamas attack. The 25-year-old from the country's southern Sunsari district that borders India was a student of agriculture with plans to join Nepal's civil service after completing his training in Israel.
His eldest sibling Mukesh Swarnakar had texted him on Friday, asking him for travel tips ahead of a trip to the country's west. "He was busy so we planned to call on Saturday," Mukesh told Al Jazeera. "I never heard from him again."
Mukesh describes his brother as smart.
'The only bad decision he made was going to Israel," he said. "He should have known it's not safe, there were bunkers and there was conflict.'
In the western Doti district, the devastated parents of Rajan Phulara, 24, who was also killed in the attack, wanted to jump into a nearby river to drown, Rajan's cousin Hemraj said. Rajan was their only son.
"The villagers spotted them and forcefully brought them back home,' said Hemraj. Rajan's father had amassed a heavy debt to educate his son, in the hopes that he would help lift the family from poverty and indebtedness.
'Before he left for Israel, he told me all their problemswould be over soon,' said Hemraj.
Rajan talked to his parents regularly and was scheduled to have a video call with them on Saturday. The call never happened.
'I want to see his body'
The deaths in Israel have sparked an outcry across Nepal. Many still in Israel are desperate to get back home.
On Thursday evening, Suraj Bhandari and 76 other Nepalese nationals who work at a farm in Kadesh Barnea in southern Israel were at Ben Gurion Airport, waiting to board an emergency flight to Kathmandu, organised by Nepal's government.
"We have now safely arrived at the airport and are now ready to depart home,' he told Al Jazeera.
Meanwhile, the victims' families have also been waiting for the bodies of the deceased to be brought back to Nepal.
'I have already lost my brother, at least I want to see his body,' said Mukesh.

Turkey quietly celebrates 100-year anniversary as a republic

October 29th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Turkey is commemorating its 100-year anniversary as a republic, but many of the festivities planned for Sunday have been called off against the backdrop of Israel's escalating attacks on the besieged Gaza Strip.
The low-profile affair shows the far-reaching impacts of the bloody Israel-Hamas war, but also brings up   within Turkish society over the state's secular legacy, elements of which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has  .
On Sunday, Erdogan laid a customary wreath at the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's revered founding father. 'Our country is in safe hands, you may rest in peace," he said.
Erdogan was scheduled to travel to Istanbul afterward to watch a procession of military ships on the Bosporus, followed by a drone and fireworks show. He was expected to deliver a speech marking the milestone, to play up his government's accomplishments.
However, Turkey cut down on much of the fanfare expected for the once-in-a-century event. It held no official state reception and cancelled special TV coverage of planned concerts and festivities, citing the 'alarming human tragedy in Gaza'.
Erdogan's appearance at a pro-Palestine rally in Istanbul the day before also partly eclipsed the centennial. There, he accused Israel of behaving like a 'war criminal' and said there was a 'vicious massacre happening in Gaza'.
Muted affair
Turkey's scaled-down centennial celebrations angered some citizens who believe Erdogan is glossing over the occasion to undermine Ataturk's secular legacy in pursuit of his own political vision — and that of his religious support base.
''The government did its best to make these celebrations forgotten and to trivialise them,' said Gul Erbil, a 66-year-old retired film director who will be toasting the centennial at a restaurant with friends. 'The sad thing is … it's [their] republic too. It's something that gave [them] freedom, too.'
Ahmet Hakan, columnist for the pro-government Hurriyet newspaper, argued that the subdued celebrations were 'inevitable' due to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.
Still, many Turks held their own private celebrations, while opposition-run municipalities organised concerts and parades. Music, including a song that was written to mark the republic's 10th anniversary, blared from cars adorned with Turkish flags. Many wore red and white — the colors of the flag.

Ataturk's legacy
Turkey's history is intimately tied to  , a nationalist leader who prioritised development reforms and separated  religion from public life. During his 15-year reign as president, he abolished the Ottoman Caliphate, replaced the Arabic script with the Latin alphabet, and enshrined women's right to vote.
Even today, Ataturk is deeply venerated throughout Turkey, where his poster is seen on the walls of schools, offices, and homes. On the anniversary of his death every year, traffic comes to a halt as thousands observe a minute of silence. His signature is tattooed on the arms of many citizens.
But not all Turks are equally inspired by Ataturk's legacy, including Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party, who look fondly upon Turkey's Ottoman and Islamic past. And while Erdogan pays homage to Ataturk's early military accolades, he rarely lauds his republican-era leadership.
'Erdogan's values'
'Erdogan wants to see Turkey become [a country] that embraces Erdogan's values, that is socially conservative, not necessarily part of the West and also, I would say, has a significant role for Islam from education to public policy,' said Soner Cagaptay, an expert on Turkey at the Washington Institute and author of books on Erdogan.
Critics say Turkey's president has already pushed the country away from its founding principles.
Official functions today often start with prayers. The Directorate of Religious Affairs enjoys a budget that dwarfs those of most other ministries. The number of religious schools has increased in line with Erdogan's stated goal of creating a 'pious generation'.
In 2020, Erdogan converted the former Byzantine-era church   — which was turned into a mosque with the Ottoman conquest of Istanbul — back into a functioning mosque. Ataturk had transformed the structure into a museum in a nod to its Christian and Muslim legacy.

Second aid convoy enters Gaza as Israel steps up bombardments

October 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A second humanitarian convoy has crossed from Egypt into the Gaza Strip as Israel continues its non-stop bombardment of the besieged enclave, killing 55 people overnight.
A total of 17 trucks entered Gaza on Sunday, a day after the first convoy comprising 20 trucks carried medical aid, food and water into the area. The strip has been under intense Israeli bombing since October 7 in the wake of deadly Hamas attack that claimed the lives of more than 1,400 Israelis.
Reporting from Khan Younis in Gaza, journalist Hani Abu Isheba told Al Jazeera that the trucks are said to contain mostly much-needed medical aid.
"Doctors are telling us that the aid is meant for hospitals in the Gaza Strip which are in dire need of medical supplies. No fuel has been reported on these trucks," he said, adding that hospitals are very concerned about the lack of fuel.
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Gaza, Thomas White of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said that the visuals of aid trucks on television which appear to look like fuel trucks do contain fuel that UNRWA is moving internally between depots.
"No fuel is coming into Gaza. Fuel is really critical now, we need it coming in to keep aid operations going," he said.
Aid agencies are also warning that the delivery of supplies should remain consistent since it is currently "only a drop in the ocean", and cannot cover the immense needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people.
The humanitarian situation in the densely populated enclave is dire. There is not only a shortage of medical supplies, but food and drinking water are also scarce as Israel has cut off electricity, fuel and water supplies in the wake of the deadliest attacks in decades.
According to the UN, sanitation facilities, water wells, reservoirs and pumping stations have suffered damage due to the incessant air strikes.
The international agency estimates that about 100 trucks per day are needed to meet the needs of Gaza.
Cindy McCain, the executive director of the World Food Programme, told Al Jazeera: 'We've got to get more trucks in." She added that it is also important to ensure aid reaches the hands of the right beneficiaries, in a safe and sustained manner.
Bombardments continue
Meanwhile, aid deliveries have come as the Israeli military continued bombing Gaza and Rafah overnight.
Israel's   have killed at least 55 people and destroyed 30 homes in Gaza, according to local authorities.
After Rafah was bombed by the Israeli army on Saturday, journalist Isheba told Al Jazeera that the scene near the crossing was one of "humanitarian aid delivery under mass bombardment".
The UN has stepped up its pressure on both Israel and Hamas and has begun calling for 'a humanitarian ceasefire' to determine where aid can safely be delivered.
'What that means is very simple: We need to have clarity about places which will not be bombed or attacked by anyone - by either side,' UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Martin Griffiths told Al Jazeera.
'Typically, civilian infrastructure, hospitals, schools, and so forth are actually exempt from any attack in war, by the rules of war by international humanitarian law,' said Griffiths, without directly referencing reported Israeli strikes on hospitals and schools hosting displaced residents of Gaza.
The UN aid chief added that he wanted negotiations to yield a formalised 'inspection regime' of aid delivered into Gaza - as has been established in other conflicts - as well as a mechanism for establishing an 'up-to-date' picture of the needs of Gaza residents to better raise funding and deliver relief.

What is the Israeli unity government and what does it want to achieve?

October 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel's parliament has approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's  , including a number of centrist opposition lawmakers, to display its determination to fight the war with Hamas in Gaza.
Here is what there is to know:
What is an Israeli unity government, and what does it want to achieve?
A national unity government, according to Israel , is a "government based on a broad coalition, the members of which also include representatives of rival parliamentary groups".
This is usually formed at times of national emergencies such as war , natural disasters or economic crises.
Before Hamas's  , Israeli politics had faced turbulence over a push by Netanyahu's government to overhaul the country's judiciary that sparked the largest protest movement in Israel's history.
'The most important action [now] is to establish the unity of the nation,' Netanyahu said in a speech, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. 'The division within us is over. We are all united. And when we are united – we win," he added.
The Israeli government established an emergency unity government and a war cabinet.
What can the unity government do?
In a statement, the unity government said it would not promote any unrelated policy or laws, except those related to the  with Hamas in Gaza.
Under the agreement, former Defence Minister Benny Gantz and members of his small centrist party will join Netanyahu's coalition, one of the most right-winggovernments inIsrael'shistory, which Gantz had previously bitterly opposed.
The leader of the largest opposition party in parliament, former Prime Minister Yair Lapid, refused to join the unity government.
What are the objectives of the Israeli war cabinet?
According to Al Jazeera's Hoda Abdel-Hamid, the main goal is to direct the offensive against Hamas.
"This war cabinet has full control over the operations of the military," Abdel-Hamid said from West Jerusalem.
"The stated goal of the military is to eliminate Hamas's military capability. There has been no talk of the civilian arm of Hamas.
"If the war cabinet wants to broaden the scope of this war, then it will have to consult the wider emergency unity government," she added.
Abdel-Hamid said the establishment of a war cabinet also eased some of the pressures Netanyahu might face during the conflict.
"This war cabinet will take away accusations against Netanyahu that he is going at it alone, that he's making his own decisions, and that he doesn't have people who have extensive military experience within his ruling coalition," Abdel-Hamid explained.
Who forms part of the war cabinet?
Israel's three-member war cabinet would include Netanyahu, Gantz and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.
The statement said that Gadi Eisenkot, also a former army chief  from Gantz's party, and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer will serve as observers, according to the statement.
A seat would be 'reserved' for Lapid in the war cabinet.
Who is Benny Gantz, the opposition member of the cabinet?
Gantz is an Israeli politician and retired army general with a 38-year career.
His career included overseeing a 1989 operation to airlift close to 15,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel.
He also served   during two military assaults on the besieged Gaza Strip in 2012 and 2014 for which he and the government faced international criticism.

A UN report in 2015 concluded  that both Israel and Palestinian groups had probably committed war crimes during the 51-day conflict.
When entering politics, Gantz managed to unite "an opposition that lacked leadership for years and seemed to offer a viable political substitute to Netanyahu", according to research conducted by the Brookings Institution.
Once praised by Netanyahu as an 'excellent officer' to whom Israelis owed gratitude, the prime minister also branded him  .
In response to the pandemic in 2020, Gantz and Netanyahu formed an emergency government, but it collapsed six months later.

First plane carrying US ammo lands in Israel as troops mass near Gaza

The first plane carrying American ammunition for Israel's offensive on Gaza has landed in the country, as hundreds of thousands of Israeli troops mass for a possible ground assault on the besieged enclave.
Wednesday's announcement comes after the United States said it would send new supplies of air defences, munitions and other security assistance to its ally to battle Hamas.
Aside from the ammunition, the US is also believed to be providing more interceptors to Israel to replenish its Iron Dome. In recent days, a barrage of rockets from Gaza has hit several targets in Israel, evading its much-vaunted aerial defence system.
Israel is a major long-term recipient of US military aid and enjoys a steady stream of American financial support.
Washington in 2016 agreed to provide  , in its largest-ever military assistance package given to a single country.
In the current phase of the conflict, Israel needs small arms for its infantry and air defence interceptors to protect its civilian infrastructure and military command and control centres.
Just hours before the latest announcement of military assistance, US President Joe Biden President reiterated his support for Israel, describing Hamas's attack on Saturday as "an act of sheer evil".
Biden also warned those who might seek to take advantage of the situation to stay away, saying US forces had "enhanced our military force posture in the region to strengthen our deterrence".
Earlier, Biden had ordered the deployment of the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, near Israel.
Biden also despatched Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel, where the top diplomat will deliver "a message of solidarity and support," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.
US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington was talking also with Israel and Egypt about the idea of creating a safe passage for civilians out of Gaza, including Palestinian Americans.
'We will come from the ground'
Washington's show of support comes as Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has pledged to escalate the war against Hamas with a ground offensive.
"We started the offensive from the air, later on, we will also come from the ground," Gallant told Israeli troops near the Gaza fence, the Reuters news agency reported.
"We've been controlling the area since day two and we are on the offensive. It will only intensify."
"Hamas wanted a change and it will get one," he added. "What was in Gaza will no longer be."
Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli military, also said in a social media post that hundreds of thousands of troops were massing near the Gaza Strip for the war with Hamas.
'What we are doing in these areas close to the Gaza Strip, is that we have deployed… our infantry, armoured soldiers, our artillery corps and many other soldiers from the reserves - 300,000 in numbers - in different brigades and divisions and they are now close to the Gaza Strip, getting ready to execute the mission that we have been given by the Israeli government,' Conricus said in a video posted on the social media platform X.
'And that is to make sure that Hamas, at this end of this war, won't have any military capabilities by which they can threaten or kill Israeli civilians," he said.

How bad is Gaza's disease outbreak amid the Israel war?

As thousands of Palestinians try to find space in Gaza's shelters or move south for safety from Israeli bombardment, infectious diseases are sweeping across the besieged enclave, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report.
Infectious maladies such as diarrhoea and chickenpox are soaring in Gaza, the WHO reported on Wednesday, while medical organisations have been warning of the   and epidemics.
Additionally, Gaza's water and sanitation crises have made residents unable to escape the ripple effects of Israeli strikes and sieges in their daily lives. A lack of clean drinking water and pollutants proliferating through waterways after infrastructure breakdowns have contributed to infections.
Faced with such limitations, hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are also cramped into shelters, potentially accelerating the spread of diseases. Thousands of others are also walking in   from north to south Gaza following Israeli orders to evacuate.
"Between the worryingly low levels of access to proper water and sanitation, the extreme density of the population and a large part of the population that has evacuated to the southern three governorates, you have a highly conducive environment for an outbreak and spread of infectious disease", said Michael Talhami, regional water and habitat adviser for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Here's what to know about the main infectious diseases that have been rampant across Gaza since mid-October, according to the WHO.
What diseases are affecting Gaza the most?
Upper respiratory infections: A total of 54,866 cases have been recorded so far. This primarily affects breathing with symptoms such as a runny nose, coughing and throat pain. Respiratory diseases were already the sixth-most common cause of death in the Gaza Strip prior to the outbreak of the war last month.
Diarrhoea: More than 33,551 cases of diarrhoea have been reported with at least half among children under the age of five, according to the WHO. By comparison, 2021 and 2022 witnessed an average of 2,000 cases per month in children under five. Drinking contaminated water is one of the key reasons behind diarrhoea.
Skin rashes: A total of 12,635 cases have occurred. Bacteria and viruses can make parts of the skin red, inflamed and itchy. Skin rashes and scabies are some of the first signs of inadequate water supply for proper hygiene, according to Talhami.
Scabies and lice: A total of 8,944 cases of these parasitic infections have been reported. While lice typically infest the hair, scabies occur on other parts of the body as they prefer to burrow into the skin. Both cause severe itching.
Chickenpox: At least 1,005 chickenpox cases have been reported. This viral disease causes itchy, blister-like rashes and fever. It primarily affects children but can infect adults too.
Statistics on deaths due to infectious diseases are typically reported by the Ministry of Health on an annual basis, although the WHO is working to get that data faster during the war, agency officials said.
What are some of the factors behind these diseases?
Contaminated or inadequate water supply, overcrowding and disrupted hygiene are some of the key factors contributing to infectious disease outbreaks.
While some families in Gaza are   in apartments, others are taking shelter in UN facilities, some of which have been labelled by the UN itself as unfit for providing 'safe and dignified living conditions'.
Meanwhile, solid waste has been collecting on the streets of Gaza, creating breeding grounds for insects and rodents that carry and transmit diseases, according to the WHO.
Harmful bacteria have also seeped through water supplies across Gaza from the sea to drinking water, becoming a major source of infections whether people are   or trying to  .
"Even if at the source, they still treat this water, as it's being delivered, there are so many ways that contaminants can get in. And it's very difficult to monitor under these circumstances," said Talhami, about the drinking water supply.
Additionally, damage to residential buildings can contaminate water supplies for domestic uses as well because they are typically connected to infrastructure that runs under main roads and side streets, he explained.
Amid a sanitation system breakdown, hundreds across Gaza are being forced to share a limited number of toilets. In shelters in the south, where people are evacuating to, at least 600 displaced people share one toilet, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
In the case of respiratory tract infections, while viruses are a common cause, a 2018 study on war-related injuries in the Gaza Strip also found that the inhalation of poisonous gas from military activity led to respiratory diseases.
Incomplete coverage of disease surveillance systems, insufficient internet and mobile phone connectivity and disrupted   have also made it difficult to monitor or respond to infectious diseases.
Even within hospitals, being forced to work with inadequate personal protective equipment or cleaning supplies means medical staff can also acquire and transmit diseases while providing care, said the WHO.
Medical sources have reported white flies and their larvae on wounds which can risk tissue damage and bacterial infection, according to OCHA.

Under Israeli bombs, Gaza's Palestinians worry they may die of hunger

October 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
In the mornings that we are lucky enough to wake up after another night of Israel's bombardment, we look at one another as if to make sure we are there.
Then, we start our grim tally: Who lost a friend? Who lost their family? Who lost their home?
We reminisce about the beautiful places we've been in the Gaza Strip, where the sand meets the foaming sea. We replay our memories, trying to hold on to them in hopes that one day we will live them again.
Is there enough for today?
In the middle of the terror and wondering if we will survive, a seemingly ridiculous question presents itself.
As we huddle in the dark, terrified of the death raining down around us, an intrusive gnawing asks us: Even if the bombs don't get us, how do we survive if we run out of food?
The thought of losing a family member because they went out for food is unbearable, Amer writes [File: Hatem Ali/AP Photo]
No one had planned to stock up before this started. I can't remember, maybe we had planned to go to the market later in the week.
In all cases, we thought we had enough before the war began.
Now, every morning, we check our food stores, the refrigerator.
Is there enough food for the day? For tomorrow?
When the meat is cooked, my mother said hopes it will not have spoiled during the 30-hour power outages.
Maybe she's used to the good old days when outages were only eight hours. In all cases, her wishful thinking doesn't make it so. After so long without power, everything has spoiled.
Our neighbourhood is a quiet one – there are no markets or bakeries near us where we can buy what we need day to day.
What food there is in the small grocery shops has soared in price because everyone is running out of everything.
Anyway, the thought of venturing out to get food, even if it's just 10 minutes, is terrifying.
The thought of losing a family member because they went out for something like that is unbearable.
It's not like we have much of an appetite; the pain all around us every day, the news of friends and colleagues killed, and the endless explosions don't allow us to have much of one.
But we have to keep ourselves alive. We don't want to die of hunger either.
No lights, no phones, no water
The nearby hospital has power, so far. So when we're desperate, we go there to charge our phones, which we use as little as possible to conserve their battery life.
But when the house shakes and an explosion sounds nearby, we need to know what is happening. Who was hurt? Did anyone die?
What happens if the health facilities can't operate any more? Asks Amer [File: Abed Zagout/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]
Yes, everything in our lives seems to depend on electricity, but more important than us are the hospitals themselves.
What worries me is what will happen to the hospital when Gaza's electricity is completely cut off. I worry about how long the critical patients, who rely on life support systems, will survive without electricity.
The worry my father voices every day, though, is more tied to the immediate survival of his family: Water.
He reminds us again and again to use water sparingly, only what we absolutely need when we absolutely need it.
See, the water doesn't run if there's no electricity, so we can go for days without getting any. The desalination plants seem to have run dry.
I almost don't know which shortage to worry about the most, when really all I care about is whether my family and I will make it out of this alive, if my friends and loved ones will be OK.
So the days when the mobile phone networks go down are the worst. For hours – heart-stoppingly panicked hours – we can't reach out to anyone to make sure they're alive, to see if that terrible boom was over their neighbourhoods.
Is that Israel's goal? To isolate Gaza from the world so no one can see the crimes being committed here?

'Israel' doesn't care about collateral damage': Bunker busters used in Gaza

October 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Plumes of smoke are springing up frequently as the Israeli   entered a third day after Hamas launched a  .
In theenclave – blockaded by land, air and sea – a labyrinth of tunnels is Gaza's lifeline, bringing in everything from food and weapons to fuel.
The tunnels are also Hamas's outposts, acting as storage and essential portals  for the Palestinian armed group.
At present, there are unverified reports that the Israeli military has targeted the tunnels in northwestern Gaza by deploying a powerful type of bomb known as bunker busters.
What are these weapons and just how powerful are they?
What are bunker busters and how do they work?
Bunker busters are 'quite powerful but horrible pieces of ammunition', Yossi Mekelberg, an expert on Israel at the London-based think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.
The bombs burrow deep into the ground before detonating and are capable of destroying buried, hardened targets.
The weapons, also known as ground penetration munitions, fall roughly into two broad categories.
The first kind has a reinforced nose so the bomb itself survives impact. The weight gives it the momentum to bury itself deep into a target, and a delayed fuse allows it to penetrate the ground or structure before detonating.
The second kind carries two charges, or bombs, on it. The first charge is small and used to open a hole in its target, allowing the rest of the bomb or missile to pass through intact. The main charge then detonates inside, destroying everything within it.
Bunker busters were first used in World War II to destroy German underground rocket factories.
Ever since there have been bunkers, there have been weapons made to "bust" or destroy them, especially from the air.
'Explosives have been used against tunnels for over a century, and the bunker busters have been used since [the] Vietnam [War],' Patrick Bury, a senior lecturer specialising in warfare and counterterrorism at Bath University, told Al Jazeera.
Where has Israel gotten these weapons?
Israel's air force has a focus on attacking and destroying underground tunnels and uranium enrichment facilities in Iran, and it has a wide range of increasingly sophisticated munitions at its disposal. They are made in the United States and domestically.
In 2021, Israel requested the newer GBU-72 model from the US, a deal that has yet to go through.
The GBU-72 is the most advanced bunker buster and is able to penetrate 30m (100ft) of earth or 6m (20ft) of concrete and obliterate anything nearby and causing a shockwave that is likely to trigger cave-ins of subterranean structures farther away than the intended target.
Why would Israel use these weapons?
Israel's reported use of these weapons in the latest fighting are an indication of its military targeting Hamas positions underground, Bury said.
According to Mekelberg, during the  , Israeli troops were trapped and killed in tunnels while trying to target Hamas.
The use of the bunker busters, therefore, allows the Israeli army to attack Hamas from a distance without risking their own forces, he explained.
Israel will likely continue to use the bombs because Hamas knows the network of tunnels best, better than Israeli forces could hope to ever navigate them themselves, Mekelberg added.
Ground penetration munitions are not only effective against tunnel complexes and underground factories but also in demolishing high buildings and towers. The bomb can enter the top of the building and penetrate all the way to the foundation, collapsing the entire building rather than blowing it up.
As the war intensifies, Israeli commanders 'will use whatever they can' to wage an assault against Hamas, Mekelberg said.
Eitan Shamir, the director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies and associate professor of political science at Bar Ilan University, also weighed in on Israel's possible use of the weapons.
'I can only hope they have it and that they are using it,' Shamir told Al Jazeera.
Do these weapons spell more civilian casualties?
All these weapons are only as good as the intelligence guiding them. When using them in urban, built-up areas, the potential for mass civilian casualties is extremely high.
According to the Geneva Conventions, the heavy-duty ammunition can only be used in "extreme circumstances of self-defence' and is prohibited for use in areas of high civilian populations.
However, Israel is likely unconcerned about collateral damage, according to Bury.
'Israel has them and will use them. I don't think they really care that much about collateral damage at the moment,' he said.

G7 foreign ministers set for talks in Japan, Israel-Gaza war to top agenda

November 7th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Foreign ministers of seven global powers along with the European Union are gathering in Japan for two days of talks that will centre on Israel's ongoing  .
Top diplomats of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the EU – which make up the Group of Seven (G7) bloc of democracies – are due to hold talks in Tokyo on Tuesday – as the death toll in Gaza mounts and concerns grow that the war could devolve into a regional crisis.
Israel, after a surprise attack on October 7 by Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, that killed more than 1,400 people in Israel, has waged a monthlong assault on the Gaza Strip, relentlessly bombarding the enclave and sending in ground forces for the first time since 2014.
Israeli attacks have   more than 10,000 Palestinians, more than a third of them children, according to Gaza's officials, while displacing 1.5 million people and decimating much of the territory's infrastructure.
The war will feature prominently in the G7 meeting, but reaching common ground may be challenging due to the countries' varying political and economic loyalties, analysts said.
"Europeans are divided and this division is also certainly visible within the G7," said Thomas Gomart, director of the French Institute of International Relations.
G7 members will also discuss the Ukraine war, relations with China, and deepening ties with Central Asia.
Host Japan has largely taken a cautious approach to the Middle East crisis, resisting pressure to fall in line with the pro-Israel stance of its closest ally, the US, officials and analysts say.
The US has provided firm backing to Israel, offering it a $14.5bn   amid the war and voting with it against a 'humanitarian truce' at the United Nations General Assembly last month.
France voted in favour of the 'humanitarian truce' while all other G7 member countries abstained.
For the bloc, agreeing on specific wording on Israel's right to defend itself, the civilian casualties in Gaza, and calls for a temporary halt in fighting will be difficult, officials say.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who touched down in Tokyo on Tuesday morning after holding three days of strained talks with the leaders throughout the Middle East, has said Washington is working "very aggressively" to expand aid for trapped civilians in Gaza.
"I think we will see in the days ahead that the assistance can expand in significant ways," Blinken said on Monday, without providing details.

Renewed support for Ukraine
Another focus of the G7 meet-up will be Russia's war in Ukraine, which has lost global attention due to the bloodshed in Gaza.
The G7 was expected to stick to firm language condemning Moscow and reaffirm its commitment to Ukraine.
"Our commitment to continue strict sanctions against Russia and strong support for Ukraine has not wavered at all, even as the situation in the Middle East intensifies," Japan's Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa told a news conference before the meeting.
The gathering will include a virtual meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.
G7 has been at the forefront of sanctions on Russia since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
In the latest move aimed at ramping up economic pressure on Russia, the group is considering proposals to impose sanctions on Russian diamonds.
Strengthening Japan-UK ties
UK's Foreign Secretary James Cleverly is set to meet Kamikawa on the sidelines of the gathering to discuss intensifying military cooperation with Japan under a new pact that allows their militaries to enter each other's territories for joint exercises.
These talks, also featuring British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps and Japan's Defence Minister Minoru Kihara, are likely to include expanding joint exercises and cooperation in new areas such as space and cybersecurity, based on the Japan-UK   reached in May.

Japan in December announced a new mid- to long-term security strategy to build up its security and defence – including counterstrike capability – in a significant shift from its self-defence-only principle adopted after the last world war.
Eyeing Central Asia
Foreign ministers of five Central Asian countries are also expected to participate online in the Tokyo gathering, as the grouping aims to deepen ties to the region amid the Ukraine war.
Ministers of former Soviet nations Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan will join for talks on Wednesday.
G7 leaders have recently increased outreach to these resource-rich countries, with French President Emmanuel Macron   in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan last week during his Central Asia tour, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida planning a similar trip in 2024.

News organisations reject allegations of complicity in October 7 attacks

Four international media outlets have denied accusations they had prior knowledge of the October 7 attacks by Hamas on southern Israel after an article by a pro-Israel media watchdog group HonestReporting questioned their work with Gaza-based freelance photojournalists.
After the publication of the article by HonestReporting, which describes itself as "a charitable organisation" with a mission to "expose anti-Israel media bias", the Israeli government also demanded explanations from Reuters, The Associated Press, The New York Times and CNN.
In an article published on Wednesday, the website pointed out that the presence on October 7 of Gaza-based photojournalists in the border area breached by Hamas raises 'serious ethical questions'. It went on to allege that their presence could have been 'coordinated with Hamas' and questioned whether the news outlets 'approved of their presence inside enemy territory'.
"Reuters categorically denies that it had prior knowledge of the attack or that we embedded journalists with Hamas on October 7," Reuters said, responding to the article and subsequent allegations by Israeli government officials.
Scoop: What were @AP , @Reuters , @CNN  & @nytimes  Gaza freelance photographers doing inside Israel on October 7? Coincidence or were they part of the plan? https://t.co/KcdXMd4DYF
- HonestReporting (@HonestReporting) November 8, 2023
"Reuters acquired photographs from two Gaza-based freelance photographers who were at the border on the morning of October 7, with whom it did not have a prior relationship," it said.
"The photographs published by Reuters were taken two hours after Hamas fired rockets across southern Israel and more than 45 minutes after Israel said gunmen had crossed the border. Reuters staff journalists were not on the ground at the locations referred to in the HonestReporting article," Reuters added.
More than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, were killed in the assault on military posts and border communities.
Since then, Israel has launched an air and ground assault on Gaza, which has so far killed at least 10,812 Palestinians, including more than 4,400 children.
Israeli government spokesperson Nitzan Chen said in a statement that Israel was demanding explanations from the four news outlets regarding the HonestReporting article, saying what the report had described "crosses every red line, professional and moral".
The AP also rejected allegations that its newsroom had prior knowledge of the attacks.
'The first pictures AP received from any freelancer show they were taken more than an hour after the attacks began. No AP staff were at the border at the time of the attacks, nor did any AP staffer cross the border at any time,' a statement said.
'The role of the AP is to gather information on breaking news events around the world, wherever they happen, even when those events are horrific and cause mass casualties.'
The news agency also said it was 'no longer working' with photographer Hassan Eslaiah, one of the four photographers who documented the attacks.
CNN has also cut ties with the photographer, who was pictured in a photograph alongside Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.
In a tweet on Thursday, HonestReporting said it was not accusing Reuters of collusion but had raised 'some serious ethical issues regarding news outlets' association with these freelancers and asked important and relevant questions that everyone deserves answers to".
Backlash from officials
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it viewed with "utmost gravity" the suggestion that journalists working with international media had joined in covering the Hamas attacks.
"These journalists were accomplices in crimes against humanity; their actions were contrary to professional ethics," it said.
Former Israeli ambassador to the UN Danny Danon went further and called on the four photojournalists to be added to the list 'of participants to the October 7 massacre' to be 'eliminated' by Israel's security services.
Israel's internal security agency announced that they will eliminate all participants of the October 7 massacre.
The photojournalists who took part in recording the assault will be added to that list.
- Danny Danon דני דנון (@dannydanon) November 9, 2023
The New York Times, which works with Yousef Masoud, another of the four photojournalists, called the accusations that its newsroom had advance knowledge of the attacks 'untrue and outrageous'.
'We also want to speak in defense of freelance photojournalists working in conflict areas, whose jobs often require them to rush into danger to provide first-hand witness accounts and to document important news. This is the essential role of a free press in wartime,' a statement by the newspaper said.
'We are gravely concerned that unsupported accusations and threats to freelancers endangers them and undermines work that serves the public interest,' it added.

Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip - When 27-year-old Bisan Dahdouh heard that an Israeli air strike had hit the central Gaza Strip area of Nuseirat where her family was sheltering, she rushed to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.
She wasn't prepared for what she would see: the body of her one-and-a-half-year-old nephew, Adam. "The first body I saw at the hospital was Adam, my sister Sondos's first and only son,' she told Al Jazeera.
It was only the beginning of a cascade of devastating news that would hit her and her family.Bisan is the daughter of  , the Al Jazeera bureau chief in Gaza.
  and Bisan her mother, 44-year-old Amna, in the Israeli bombing. Wael's 16-year-old son, Mahmoud; his seven-year-old daughter, Sham; and his grandchild, Adam, were also killed in the attack.
Eight other extended family members, including Wael's cousin's daughter and her four children, were also killed in the attack.
In the emergency department of  , Bisan sat anxiously, awaiting updates on her injured siblings — Sondos, Kholoud, Batoul and Yehya. They all sustained injuries but survived.
The Dahdouh family had recently evacuated from the Tal al-Hawa neighborhood in the northern Gaza Strip to the Nuseirat area on orders from the Israeli army instructing half of Gaza's residents to move south.
Amna was fasting when she was killed.
"They had prepared a meal, but she chose to pray before breaking her fast. The bomb then struck, and everything was gone,' Bisan said before breaking into tears, overwhelmed with grief and shock.
Sitting beside her was her cousin, Samah Dahdouh, who lost her 20-year-old brother, Ayman, as well as her 30-year-old sister, Hadeer, and Hadeer's four children: Mayar, Malak, Mayess and Maid.
With tears in her eyes, 37-year-old Samah explained how she had made the decision to return home to Tal al-Hawa just a day before her family was killed.
She witnessed air strikes throughout the area, prompting her to return to the north while her family remained in Nuseirat.
"They were all gathered at home, and now they're all gone, my sister and all her children," she said as she wept.
"I was on the verge of losing my mind. I couldn't make it to the hospital from Gaza to Deir el-Balah at night. I arrived this morning. I couldn't bid them farewell," Samah said.
She lamented the fact that Ayman, who was recently engaged and was preparing for marriage, was among the victims.
'My only sister'
Among the wounded was 81-year-old Hanan Dahdouh, Wael's mother-in-law, who suffered severe injuries to her hands and face.
Her 57-year-old son, Ali Dahdouh, spoke in a low voice as he expressed his devastation.
"Amna was my only and youngest sister. We are nine brothers and one sister," he told Al Jazeera.
'We live next to each other in Tal al-Hawa, southwest of Gaza City, and we all evacuated to Nurseirat after the Israeli orders," he explained.
'I used to have breakfast with Amna and her husband, Wael, every Friday," said Ali with tears in his eyes. "Our relationship was very strong."
Ali was not home when the shelling took place but rushed to the hospital when the news broke.
He explained that his mother remained unconscious and unaware of the tragedy that had befallen her family.
The killing of the Dahdouh family members is no different from the reality for all the residents of Gaza, Ali said. 'Everyone here is a target. No place is safe," he noted.
More than 7,000 Palestinians, including 3,000 children, have been killed since Israel launched a bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on October 7, the day Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in attacks on southern Israel.
Ali said he is worried about the moment when his mother wakes up to find that her only daughter was killed along with her children.
'My mother is very attached to her. It's a big catastrophe."

Blinken reaffirms US support for 'humanitarian pauses' in Gaza

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reaffirmed Washington's position calling for '  ' in Gaza to protect civilians and allow foreign nationals to leave, as the Israeli military   and hospital in the Gaza Strip.
Blinken held a news conference in Jordan's capital, Amman, on Saturday alongside Jordan's Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi and Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, during his third visit to the region since the war began.
While Jordan and Egypt reiterated the demand of Arab states calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, Blinken said humanitarian pauses 'can be a critical mechanism for protecting civilians,   and getting foreign nationals out of Gaza' while 'still enabling Israel to achieve its objective' to defeat Hamas.
"It's our view that a ceasefire now would leave Hamas in place to regroup and repeat attacks," Blinken said.
'We spoke about ways to accelerate and expand the sustained delivery of aid,' he told reporters, adding that 'as Israel conducts its campaign, how it does it matters.'
Countries across the Middle East have played an essential role in preventing the spread of conflict to the rest of the region, Blinken said, and that discussions were continuing with Qatar on   in Gaza.
He pointed out that while 100 trucks are now moving through Rafah every day, up from about 20 a week ago, that is still 'not nearly enough'.
'Region sinking in sea of hatred'
Safadi said Israel was 'committing  ' in Gaza and it should not be above international law.
He condemned the Hamas attack on October 7, but said the war on Gaza could not be permitted to continue.
'The whole region is sinking in a sea of hatred that will define generations to come,' Safadi said.
'We don't accept that this is  ,' Safadi said, calling for an immediate ceasefire. 'It cannot be justified under any pretext and it will not bring Israel security, it will not bring the region peace.'
Safadi also said Blinken has a leading role to play in efforts to end the war.
Shoukry said Egypt demands an international investigation into 'blatant' actions seen in the war on Gaza.
'It's clear there is unhappiness about how the United States is handling this,' Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher said from occupied East Jerusalem.
US 'ineffective' in the region
Blinken's talks in Amman came as the US has been facing criticism from regional leaders for failing to get Israel to sign on to the idea of humanitarian pauses to ease the suffering of civilians in Gaza.
Speaking during a policy conference in Abu Dhabi on Saturday, the diplomatic adviser of the president of the United Arab Emirates, Anwar Gargash, said the US needs to push for a quick end to the conflict and a new strategy or else be considered ineffective by the region.
'If this crisis continues, especially the humanitarian side, and if this crisis brings us back full circle to the old containment policy of pre-October 7, I think the American role here, forget right or wrong, but it will not be seen as effective,' Gargash said.
Earlier this week,   to Israel and told Israel's envoy not to return to Jordan until the Gaza crisis was over.
On Saturday,   and recalled its ambassador to Israel for consultations due to the humanitarian crisis and continuing Israeli attacks in Gaza. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said earlier that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was 'no longer someone we can talk to'.
Blinken will go to Turkey on Sunday for meetings with Erdogan and top officials on Monday, the US Department of State said.
On Saturday, at least 15 people were killed and dozens more wounded in an Israeli attack on   school in Jabalia refugee camp.
9,488 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began, mostly women and children, while 1,400 people died in Israel, mostly in the Hamas attack on October 7.

Analysis: Israel's ground war in Gaza could get much bloodier

November 5th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel's ground offensive in Gaza started last week as a slow, rolling, gradual advance of land forces along three main axes: from the north, armoured and mechanised units moved at Gaza City in two columns across the 6km (3.7-mile) front. The strongest force drove straight towards the central sections of the urban agglomeration and reached it without significant obstruction or losses.
The second column moved along the Mediterranean beaches. Although it seems to have advanced further south than the units pushing against the city, it looks as if this force has not yet completely cut off Gaza City's access to the sea.
The third group advanced from the east, across relatively easy ground that consists of desert and farmland, with a few tiny hamlets unsuitable to mount a determined defence. It reached the sea, cutting the northern section of the Strip, with Gaza City, from the south, as I predicted three weeks ago.
Establishing facts on the ground is not easy but information from both sides and non-combatants seems to confirm that the front lines have moved.
It is difficult to determine how ground battles are being fought and how the two militaries are performing. There is little reliable information and lots of unverified or unverifiable claims. There are very few observers on the ground with the ability to recognise the fine detail in both sides' tactics and operations who also have the integrity and impartiality to report on them.
Analysts like me must rely on our own wartime experience and skill in reading between the lines of the respective media releases and official announcements. Those almost inevitably contain facts spiked with propaganda and outright lies, planted to mislead the observers or obfuscate unpleasant issues.
The rise of social media means common citizens, rather than trained journalists, are often first on the scene of any significant event. While it is commendable that with the advent of civilians with media-capable mobile phones we have more material from warzones, we must be cautious in accepting for fact even what the videos and photographs purport to show.
The number of misleading and erroneous claims, many made honestly and in good faith, has increased manifold, as has the volume of intentionally false claims supposedly originating from witnesses. A reporter or analyst has to judge the plausibility and veracity of claims made. Thousand of examples prove how the same video can have two sides. To illustrate the complexities of basing a testimony and explanation on a single scene or side, I will use an example from another war I covered.
Some buildings in a hospital complex were hit by smart bombs, causing a significant number of casualties. Numerous camera teams, including respectable international agencies and TV networks, were soon on the scene and officials from the targeted side lamented how the aggressors had hit the hospital, protected by international laws of war.
A handful of experienced journalists tried to learn more, sneaking to the far side of the hospital despite the military ban and roadblocks. They found the attacked side's army hastily extracting its dead and wounded soldiers and radar and missile equipment from the purportedly medical-only facility.
When discovered, the journalists were attacked not just by the soldiers, but also by local civilians who very strongly believed that the international media should only portray them as victims, not as the side misusing the status of protected sites.
Versions of this play out in every war – and often from both sides.
Meanwhile, despite ceaseless bombing from the air, the urban war in Gaza seems to have not started in earnest. It is not yet house-to-house and down in the tunnels.
From videos available so far, it appears that both sides are limiting their engagement to small-unit probes and very brief hit-and-run attacks.
The Israelis appear to have opted for the slower approach, using a significant number of dismounted soldiers. Rather than staying in the safety of heavy armoured personnel carriers, the infantry must dismount, spread out and follow tanks on foot. They take higher risks, but the tanks are safer.
The necessity of such tactics is confirmed by a Palestinian video showing a daring ambush that destroyed a latest-generation Merkava. A Hamas fighter runs up to the tank from the side, a blind spot for the crew, and plants an explosive device. Then another fighter hit the explosive from a standoff distance with an antitank projectile, causing a blast much stronger than that of just a single weapon. Hamas claimed that it destroyed three Merkavas but the details of the other cases are not known.
Although the video does not show it, that surprise tank hit could have been made using one of the Hamas tunnels to approach the Israeli position. If so, it would be an illustration of how dangerous they can be.
One of the first Israeli army videos from the urban area of Gaza City depicts soldiers inspecting a manhole and the opening of a vertical entrance to one of those tunnels.
The attackers have probably identified hundreds or even thousands of access points to the tunnel network. Getting inside them to track down Hamas fighters, attempt to liberate at least some hostages, and ultimately destroy the tunnels, will probably constitute the next, bloodier and more protracted stage of war.
But with the United States increasingly vocal about the need for a 'significant pause' in fighting to give hostage release talks a chance, that stage might be postponed or even avoided altogether.

'One minute to say goodbye' to a father, son, husband: Hussein Abu Jamei

November 26th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Khan Younis, Gaza Strip – It was 1am when the group of first responders in Khan Younis received the call – there had been an Israeli air raid nearby.
Along with his colleagues, Sayyed Mohammed Abu Jamei rushed to the site and started digging through the rubble to find any survivors. In the middle of scrabbling frantically through the debris, Sayyed found himself looking at the body of his own brother, Hussein.
In the early hours of October 24, shocked and grief-stricken, he listened as a nearby wailing grew louder – before realising it was coming from himself.

Hussein's mother, his wife Hadeel Abu Abed and their children all rushed to the hospital. They arrived only a few moments before he was buried, managing only a rushed final farewell inside a dangerously overcrowded morgue.
'They had one minute to say goodbye,' said Sayyed, 46. 'The children were able to kiss him. But his wife and my mother only looked at him for the last time.
'My mother wished she could kiss him, but she couldn't because of the crowd.'
Talking to Al Jazeera in the hospital's waiting area, Sayyed's eyes drifted as he tried to sum up who his brother was: 'He was decent, he was level-headed, he was polite,' he repeated, over and over.
Hussein was only 32 when he died – killed by an Israeli missile that hit a residential neighbourhood in southern Khan Younis where he was sheltering with friends and extended family members.
His dream was to pay off some loans he had taken to build a small apartment above his parent's house and to buy a car. Eventually, he wanted to save up enough to buy a piece of land to build a bigger house for his wife, three children, and unborn baby.
He often told his brother how much wanted his children to have a place where they could create beautiful memories. To achieve this dream, Hussein worked long hours as a driver, doing odd jobs from dusk to dawn in the besieged Gaza Strip.
'My brother was one of those people who you would like from the moment you met,' Sayyed said. 'He had an ease and calm about him that would draw people to him.'
Twenty days before he was killed, Hussein had taken his pregnant wife and three children, Abdallah, 10, Ahmed, 7, and Hoda, three, to stay at his in-laws' home in Bani Souhaila, further south in the strip.
He had also left the family's apartment in the east of Khan Younis and moved to the south of the city.
A family torn apart
When they fell in love, Hadeel and Hussein had already been neighbours for a while.
They had a traditional Palestinian wedding, complete with a zaffeh (wedding procession) and have celebrated their wedding anniversary every year.
'Hadeel was everything to him,' Sayyed said. 'He cherished and respected her, and tried to provide her with everything she needed.
'The day each of his children was born, Hussein was overjoyed and distributed sweets in the neighbourhood to share his joy,' Sayyed added.
'Hussein had a special bond with his kids. He was a child at heart and doted on his children despite the hardships of his life.
'He made sure to take time out of his busy day to play with them and to do the things they liked to do. He even used to play with them in the street.'

Hussein missed his children terribly during the period they were separated, Sayyed said. He tried to go see them as often as he could – the last time was on the day before he was killed. Despite the danger, he checked also on his parents in the al-Zana district in eastern Khan Younis, five kilometres (3.1 miles) away, every two to three days.
'Hussein had a very warm and loving relationship with my parents and siblings. He was very attached to his kids and wife. God help them. He would make sure to help the children with their homework, he wanted them to excel. He would call them 'Dr Abdallah', 'Dr Hoda',' Sayyed said, his voice trembling.
Asked about how Hussein's wife was doing, he said despairingly: 'We have 10,000 martyrs in Gaza. She reacted like any of the people who have lost loved ones.'
Sombre and exhausted, Sayyed thought about what his brother would have wanted if he had lived.
'He wasn't a man of grand ambitions. He wanted what an average young man his age wanted: to be content, have a decent life, and live in peace.'

Will global oil prices keep rising due to the Israel-Hamas war?

October 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Global oil prices have spiked since   between Israel and Hamas amid speculation about how the conflict could affect energy production in the Middle East.
On Monday, global benchmark Brent Crude rose 4.2 percent to $88.15 a barrel, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate rose 4.3 percent to $86.38 per barrel.
While neither Israel nor the besieged Gaza Strip are significant oil producers, markets have been jolted by fears that the conflict could lead to wider regional instability.
The Middle East is home to some of the world's biggest major oil producers, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, as well as key transit routes such as the Strait of Hormuz, which is known as the world's most important 'oil chokepoint'.
Will oil prices keep rising for the foreseeable future?
While much will depend on how the conflict plays out, analysts say the immediate effect on energy prices is likely to be limited.
Unlike the spike in oil prices that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, the fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters, which has killed more than 1,500 people so far in Israel and Gaza, does not directly involve oil-producing nations.
Morgan Stanley said in a note on Monday that the near-term risk to oil supply was low but that could change if the conflict spread to other countries.
'In the very short term, despite the speculative reaction we are seeing in the oil market, I see the upside risk to crude prices as actually being limited from this event,' Mike Rothman, president and founder of Cornerstone Analytics, told Al Jazeera.
Rothman said that he also does not expect the conflict to impact global demand and OPEC production in the longer term, although other factors such as declining oil inventories elsewhere in the world could affect prices.
What factors could lead oil prices to rise further?
Two key factors to watch are whether the conflict draws in Iran or Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based armed group that is an ally of both Hamas and Iran.
On Monday, Hezbollah said it had fired a barrage of rockets after at least three of its members were killed during an Israeli bombardment  .
Iran denied involvement in Hamas's surprise attack on Israel on Saturday, following a report in the Wall Street Journal that claimed Iranian security officials helped plan the assault.
The US and Israel military both say they have seen no evidence to support Iranian involvement, although Tehran offered its congratulations to Hamas following the attack.
How could Iran's involvement affect oil prices?
Former US President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran's oil industry in 2018, but Iranian oil exports and output rose in 2022 and 2023 as Washington and Tehran resumed talks over the Islamic republic's controversial nuclear programme.
Any evidence of Iranian involvement in the Hamas attack would likely deal a setback to those negotiations and potentially lead to further US sanctions on Iranian energy.
'The recent jump in oil price reflects the oil market being concerned about the conflict becoming a wider conflagration, which could involve Middle East regional players becoming involved through their proxy agents," Alan Gelder, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told Al Jazeera.
"The most immediate market impact could become more stringent enforcement on Iranian exports – which have grown by over 400 kb/d over the course of this year – by the US if the conflict widens. We are closely watching regional and international diplomatic efforts to avoid further escalation."
In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Rapidan Energy Group President Bob McNally said that oil prices could surge by $5 to $10 a barrel if Iran was drawn into the conflict.
Rothman, however, said he had 'serious doubts' that Israel would directly engage with Iran militarily.
'While Tehran has indicated its support for the Hamas attack, that verbal support falls well short of the evidence needed for Israel to respond kinetically to Iran,' he said.
What happened to oil prices during previous conflicts involving Israel and Palestinians?
The current rise in oil prices has conjured up memories of the 1973 oil crisis that followed the  , when Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israel to regain territory.
Like Saturday's attack by Hamas, the war 50 years ago began on a Jewish holiday and caught Israeli forces unawares.
In response to US support for Israel during the 1973 conflict, Arab oil-producing countries cut oil production and placed embargoes on the US and some of its allies, causing oil prices to quadruple over the following months.
The situation today, however, is very different from back then.
Rothman said there was a 'near-zero probability' of such a dramatic spike in prices happening this time.
'The fallout of the '73 embargo made many in OPEC conclude that the action was a huge mistake because of the decades of ill-will generated by the large oil-consuming nations,' he said.

'Nothing to do with this': Thai families plead for Hamas hostages' release

Bangkok, Thailand – The distinctive Buddhist tattoo on the shoulder of the man lying face down on a roadside at the point of Hamas guns confirmed Kanyarat Suriyasri's worst fears.
'I immediately knew it was my husband,' Kanyarat told Al Jazeera.
Owat Suriyasri, 40, is feared to be among the 14 Thai nationals believed to have been kidnapped in Israel and taken into Gaza by Hamas fighters as hostages.
'I just want to appeal to Hamas to release the Thais – they have nothing to do with this. They only left Thailand to work to provide for their families,' Kanyarat said. 'They all have children.'
Owat, a father of two teenage boys, moved to Israel to work on a farm.
Like most of the 30,000 Thais working in Israel, mostly in agriculture, Owat hails from Isaan, Thailand's poorest region.
For families like Owat's that do not own land, working overseas offers the chance to build a nest egg – an arduous task in Thailand's northeastern region, where workers typically earn as little as 6,000 baht ($160) a month.
'Otherwise you have to live paycheque to paycheque … you can never start a life without owning some land here,' Kanyarat, 39, said.
Feared missing or dead
Thailand has reported the highest death toll from Saturday's attack by Hamas fighters  of any foreign country so far.
At least 20 Thai migrant workers are feared dead, Kanchana Patarachoke, a spokesperson for Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Wednesday, raising the death toll from 18.
On the 'Thai labourers in Israel' Facebook page, desperate relatives are seeking news of others feared missing or dead.
The hometowns listed by families include some of the poorest places in Thailand, including Kalasin, Surin, and Sisaket.
More than 1,200 Israelis were killed in Saturday's attack, according to Israeli officials.
At least 950 Palestinians have been killed in subsequent strikes on Gaza by Israeli forces, according to Gaza authorities.
After two years of working on an Israeli avocado, pomelo and lime farm a few kilometres from the Gaza border, Owat was due to make his first visit home to his family in Sisaket at the end of the year.
Kanyarat said her husband was planning to complete his five-year contract in Israel, pay off debts and come back to Thailand with enough savings to build a small house and send their kids to college.
'I'm pleading with them not to do anything to him, I turned off my socials, I don't watch the news any more … I'm too scared,' Kanyarat said.
Owat's home in Khantaralak district runs mainly on income from rubber and rice plantations.
But rubber prices have fallen to 20 baht ($0.5) a kg, according to village chief Tawan Wangkahad, pushing dozens of locals to leave for Israel in recent years.
'They all want to come home for sure,' he told Al Jazeera.
'But most people are in debt, they have to borrow money to buy equipment to work in agriculture, sometimes they borrow to rent land to farm with interest payments of 10 percent.'

In 2011, Israel signed an agreement with Thailand to increase supervision and scrutiny of the recruitment process. Tel Aviv said the agreement, which has since lapsed, would reduce by 80 percent the cost of broker fees of up to $10,000 for Thai workers going overseas.
Under the countries' labour scheme, Thai workers are paid a minimum wage of 5,300 shekels a month ($2,000), six or seven times more than they earn at home, which in theory should allow them to pay off their agents and brokers within months – and start saving.
Charlie Loisoong, chairman of the Thai Labour Solidarity Committee, said most Thai migrant workers in Israel were farmers back home with low incomes and low levels of education.
'They'd have to work so hard their whole life here, but they only need five years over there to stand on their own feet,' he told Al Jazeera.
'It's hot and dangerous in the Middle East but Israel is probably the best option for overseas work.'
Israel ranks third behind South Korea and Taiwan for registered Thai migrant workers.
As the first coffins carrying the victims returned to Thailand on Wednesday, relatives spoke of the sacrifices made by their loved ones overseas.
Some left their homes to pay down debts or school fees, or to provide for elderly parents or children in rural villages where work is restricted to agriculture.
'There's nothing we can do about it but to wait and pray,' Piyanus Phujuttu, whose cousin Khomkrit Chombua was seen on video being held captive by Hamas, told Al Jazeera.
'He went because money and opportunity are just better than Isaan. Why did this have to happen to my family?' she added.
Thailand's government has announced plans to evacuate more than 3,000 workers who have said they want to leave Israel immediately, while Israel has told Bangkok that another 5,000 in areas close to the Gaza border have been pulled back to safer zones.
Despite the dangers, some poor Thais feel that opportunity must come before their security.
On the 'Thai labourers in Israel' Facebook page, one Thai worker said he would go back, no matter how bad the security situation gets.
In the rush of comments that followed, another post summarised the feelings of many Thai overseas workers: 'Poverty is scarier.'

Eritreans in Tel Aviv unsure if they fear Netanyahu or other Eritreans more

Tel Aviv, Israel – Halefom Sultan, an Eritrean refugee in Israel living in the diverse central Tel Aviv neighbourhood of Neve Sha'anan, says he is afraid to venture out of his house at night out of fear of violent retribution from pro-regime Eritreans.
He fears that more, he says, than he fears the cries heard around Israel to deport Eritrean asylum seekers – derisively referred to as 'infiltrators' in right-wing Israeli discourse.
An event at the nearby Eritrean embassy commemorating the 30th anniversary of Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki's rise to power descended into violence on Saturday as pro- and anti-regime supporters fought in the streets. More than 170 people were injured, including dozens of police, and about 10 were seriously injured.
Sultan, who was with the anti-Afwerki protesters, says: 'I have no choice but to speak out and protest.'
Unprepared police
'It was the racist police's fault,' says an Eritrean refugee who declined to be identified, referring to what even the police acknowledged was a lack of preparation in spite of repeated warnings before the protest by anti-regime Eritreans.
He speaks to Al Jazeera in a park in Neve Sha'anan as a swarm of Israeli border police draw a crowd during an arrest of two people accused of involvement in the riot.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised 'immediate deportation' of those caught up in Saturday's demonstrations, and 53 suspects have reportedly already been moved to administrative detention with an uncertain future.
Clashes at events sponsored by the Eritrean government have erupted in cities across the world from Toronto to Stockholm and Giessen, Germany. Sultan believes two factors contributed to the increased violence in Tel Aviv beyond the fierce police response.
'In Israel, it is unique that the entire Eritrean community lives in the same dense neighbourhood,' he explains, saying that this causes ongoing friction between the two groups.
Such tension was demonstrated outside a nursery for children of African refugees, where one of the teachers waiting outside tells Al Jazeera about a confrontation between members of the pro- and anti-government camps: '[On Saturday,] one of the parents was pointing a gun and another a knife and are now both picking up their kids from the same school.'
Freedom of speech and human rights are notoriously limited in Eritrea, which has not held elections since Afwerki led the country to independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
Political parties are banned, and citizens are forced into military service. Many Eritreans find the country so repressive that they flee, many to Europe and Israel.
Anti-government Eritreans have the freedom to speak out against Afwerki's rule while living abroad, but Sultan says that in Israel, government supporters "feel more comfortable" to oppose the anti-government group because of Israel's historic ties to the Eritrean government. The current details of Israel's military and diplomatic relations with Eritrea are unknown to the public.
'Infiltrator'
Sigal Rozen, public policy coordinator for the Tel Aviv-based Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, worries that the government backlash is causing fears beyond the Eritrean community in Israel, where thousands of other vulnerable asylum seekers have an uncertain legal status.

'There is a lot of misunderstanding [around Netanyahu's call for deportations],' she says of the refugee community in the last few days. 'I received a phone call from Ghanaian migrants who thought that all these decrees [in the media] refer to them as well.'
Saturday's battle is just the latest trial Eritrean asylum seekers have faced since thousands arrived in Israel in 2006. At that time,the knee-jerk reaction of mostly right-wing Israelis was to call them by a recycled derogatory term from Israeli history, "infiltrator".
Professor Galia Sabra, who studies African migration at Tel Aviv University, explains: 'The term 'infiltrator' comes from Israeli history in the 1950s when the Fedayeen [Palestinian freedom fighters in Jordan] entered Israel via the Jordan Valley.'
The irony, she highlights, lies in the fact that 'anyone who seeks refuge enters without permission since there is no visa' a person can apply for to acquire refugee status before arriving in a safe-haven country.
Sabra, a Jewish Israeli advocate for migrant justice, is among those who are critical of Israel's refugee determination process, which she says is slow and does not fully follow UN guidelines.
Even when judgements are eventually made, she says: 'From thousands of requests, only 20 were accepted, compared with approximately 70 percent in Canada, Sweden or Norway.'
Sabra says it pains her that the current government, dominated by religious Jews, ignores the Torah's commands to 'love the stranger' because 'Israel were once strangers in Egypt'.
The Israeli government justifies closing Israel's doors by claiming it is maintaining the 'Jewish demographic character of the state', she adds.
'I know it is just a political term,' Sultan says about being labelled an 'infiltrator'.
'They use it intentionally, so they can do everything they have done to us, … starting with detaining us [in government facilities upon arriving to Israel] and, when we are released from prison, keeping us out of work. The word 'infiltrator' is designed to do these things.'

A fateful decision, Israeli bombing, a young mother killed fleeing Gaza

Gaza City – Freelance photographer Sameh Murad was at al-Shifa Hospital at the worst moment of his life on Friday, October 13.
The 29-year-old's wife, daughters, mother and siblings had fled Gaza City earlier that day on the back of a pick-up truck, heading south to Khan Younis.
His wife, Dina Taher, died on that fateful day when an air raid bombed the convoy of fleeing civilians.
"She was the love of my life," he told Al Jazeera. "I don't think I will ever meet someone like her again."
"We were in love for five years … but I heard that someone had asked her family for her hand in marriage, so I moved heaven and earth to convince her family I was suitable in 2021."
Dina had been stressed for a week as Israel bombed Gaza City relentlessly. She was worried about the safety of their two daughters, 22-month-old Mayar and baby Mirna.
That day, Sameh said, Israel demanded that the Palestinians in north Gaza evacuate and head south, and Dina thought they should, to be safe.
"She wasn't sure, but she was also worried, so in the end, she went," he said, looking away. Sameh stayed behind in al-Shifa Hospital with other journalists who were working from there – the hospital was sheltering thousands of people on its grounds who had lost their homes and huddled together in fear.

But the evacuees were   from the sky. More than 70 people, mostly women and children, were killed in the convoys.
Sameh was frantic when he heard his family were in one of the trucks that were targeted, the dead and the injured were being brought to Shifa, he was told.
A passenger car brought his family back to al-Shifa Hospital. Sameh ran to the car and grabbed his daughters in relief.
Then he realised that Dina was not in the car.
"The ambulances take those who were killed to another entrance," he said haltingly. "I knew she was gone.
"I can't describe the feeling of getting that first phone call telling me to check on my family because the truck had been hit. The excruciating wait to see if they were all okay."
The fateful decision
Sameh's mother, 47-year-old Samah Murad Msameh, has been at al-Shifa since the convoy was attacked. She is looking after her granddaughters and Sameh's brother Waseem who was hurt in the bombing.
Being in the same place as Sameh helps because whenever he has a break in his work he comes to find them and spends time with his daughters, playing with them and distracting them a bit.

It also helps him, he said, because his girls are nearby and he can go find them whenever a frightening sound happens and he wonders if they are scared.
Msameh is still in shock over what happened."This aggression is on a whole other level," she says, drawing a shaky breath.
They were barely out of Gaza City, near Shujayea she said, when people on the street started warning the convoy to turn back because they had heard that other evacuees had been killed. But the trucks kept going, for about 20 metres (66 feet), before an explosion sounded.
"I'd never heard such a noise before. We were engulfed in thick black smoke and screams rose up around me, my ears filled with other people's screams but I couldn't see what was going on.
"My daughter-in-law was bleeding from her forehead. I tried to wipe the blood and asked her what had happened to her. When she turned her face, I saw that she had lost her eye and I started screaming. Then I told her to stay awake, that she had to be strong, that I would call an ambulance and we would get out of there.
"Then my son Waseem started shouting that he'd been wounded in his leg. The attacks were still coming down on us from the sky. I managed to push my daughter out of the truck bed, which was full of dead and wounded people, and told her to run as fast as she could.
The Murad family are now taking refuge in al-Shifa Hospital [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]
"My son was screaming for me to help him but all I could do was tell him to lie still because I feared his injuries would get worse.
"About 30 of us hid behind concrete barriers that used to be a police checkpoint near the road. Then an angel in the form of a driver stopped by the truck and I saw him carrying my son to his car. I ran towards them, and he took us all to the hospital.
Since then, I haven't been able to sleep one minute. My daughter is lifeless, no emotion or reaction from her. My daughter-in-law is, well … God rest her soul.
"Every time I close my eyes, I see the people killed, my daughter-in-law bleeding, and my son screaming 'Help me'. I know I'll need months of therapy just to get through this. I can't bear what I witnessed."

Analysis: How Israel could gain from a pause in the Gaza war

November 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Claims and denials of a potential ceasefire in Gaza continue. Some reports refer to a  , while others extend the truce to a full five days. Still, others claim the ceasefire could begin imminently. And so on.
Even statements from the horse's mouth differ. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied the report published by The Washington Post on Saturday that a tentative deal had been reached; a United States representative confirmed that talks were continuing but that a breakthrough was still awaited.
On Sunday,   Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani announced in Doha that the differences remaining between Hamas and Israel were 'very minor'. Qatar has been central to mediation efforts in the war, including for the release of Israeli captives.
The last to be heard on the subject was Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh who on Tuesday told Reuters news agency that the parties are 'close to reaching a truce agreement'. Another Hamas official told Al Jazeera that negotiations were centred on the duration of the truce, details of aid delivery to Gaza and the exchange of hostages and prisoners.
Where there's smoke, there's fire. With most parties involved looking to temporarily halt the carnage in Gaza, one must hope for the small step to a temporary respite.
It is also prudent to examine why the two warring sides are considering such a hiatus.
While such a pause would benefit Hamas politically, militarily there seems to be no obvious gain — as I'll explain on Wednesday.
For Israel, on the other hand, pausing the war could be advantageous from a military point of view and disadvantageous from a political one.
The Israeli war machine has been going at full strength for six weeks in the air and three weeks on the ground in Gaza. Since the Hamas attacks, Israel's   has continued at a surprisingly high rate.
It was clear from day one that the primary purpose of such merciless pounding of Palestinian civilian targets was not military. Initially, many analysts believed that the intense aerial attacks served to demonstrate to the Israeli populace that the armed forces were doing something and that bombing would be eased once land forces moved in.
Even a country that boasts of its preparedness for war needs to maintain substantial reserves of weapons and ammunition.
Omar Bradley, a US Army general during World War II, once said 'amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics'. Israeli forward commanders may be eager to continue pounding Gaza come what may, but the rear echelon has done the maths and does not like the result. There are reliable reports escaping the net of military secrecy that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) is running out of smart bombs.
It is always difficult to judge the credibility of allegations in military matters. Sometimes an officer who is disillusioned with his side — especially when it is fighting outside its borders or inflicting heavy civilian losses — will anonymously leak crucial details.
Several specialised online forums claim that the IAF, having expended more than 2,500 joint direct attack munition (JDAM) smart bomb kits over Gaza, has just 10 days of stocks remaining.
Every military regulates how much ammunition must remain in reserve for emergencies. Exact figures are a guarded secret, but everything points to Israel's quartermasters having sounded alarms, asking for urgent replenishment.
Specialised military items can be bought to fill gaps. In 1973, when Israel was on the verge of running out of stocks fighting Syria, Egypt and their Arab allies, the US launched 'Operation Nickel Grass', the biggest military airlift in history. The US Air Force flew almost 1,000 tonnes of weapons and ammunition to Israel per day, for a total of more than 22,000 tonnes.
That is  , albeit on a smaller scale. For the past two weeks, US C-17 transports have been landing regularly at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv and at Nevatim airbase in the Negev desert.
Most aircraft fly in from the Ramstein airbase in Germany, where the US has warehouses full of 'prepositioned stock' — equipment set aside for military emergencies.
There is little doubt that heavier and less urgent supplies are being  . Among them will surely be replenishment rockets for the tracked version of the high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), the M270 multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) that saw heavy use in Gaza.
In October, the US released its own missiles for the Iron Dome air defence system to Israel. Israel's response to initial heavy Hamas rocket attacks and attacks from Hezbollah and the Houthis had depleted Israel's stocks to such an alarming level that it requested all of the Tamir interceptor missiles that the US had bought and kept in Israel until deployment.
The Israeli forces would also welcome a break in fighting to evaluate its tactics so far in light of its performance against Hamas tunnels. As many analysts have warned — me included — despite dogs, robots, ground-penetrating radars, and other technology, the   can be destroyed only once soldiers get inside. That is a bloody task, as was proven last week when four commandos were killed by an improvised explosive device after opening a tunnel cover.
A few days ago, an unidentified Israeli officer briefing reporters embedded with the Israeli forces admitted, "We don't want to go down there. We know that they left us a lot of side bombs.' London-based weekly The Jewish Chronicle reported on November 16 that standing orders were clear: "No one is allowed to  ."
The Israeli forces must also look into the effectiveness of their allegedly sophisticated and specialised training in simulators of Gaza City. Some of the simulation assumptions based on 2009 and 2014 incursions into Gaza have proven not applicable in 2023. It will also have to analyse why so many  , believed almost invincible, were incapacitated. Reliable reports indicate up to 30 have been destroyed or are too damaged to use.
While the military would welcome three or five days of respite — but would likely not admit it — politicians would clearly see it as their loss.
Netanyahu and his hawks have been staunchly against any pause so if they accept it now, the public will see it as their weakness, no matter how they try to justify bowing to international pressure. The fact that US President Joe Biden, notionally Israel's closest ally, has put his weight behind securing a break must be rubbing salt into the Israeli PM's wounds.
If the agreed period without fighting is observed, which is always a big risk, Israeli politicians will face new pressure at its end; the world might ask, 'If it was a success, why don't you just extend it?'
Netanyahu's greatest nightmare would be to get to a point where he not only failed to destroy Hamas but de facto recognised it by negotiating, even if indirectly. Deprived of Gaza, fuming Israelis would certainly go for his political skin instead.

Relief in Lebanon as Hezbollah's Nasrallah holds off on wider Israel war

November 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Beirut, Lebanon — Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah on Friday called for a ceasefire in Gaza while holding off on announcing any broader conflict with Israel, bringing relief to Lebanon where many were fearing the prospects of war.
Nasrallah claimed that Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which set off the current war, was carried out without Hezbollah or Iran's knowledge, in a   on Friday.
Yet, the leader of the Iran-backed Shia political party and armed group also said all options were on the table for an intensification with Israel if the crisis in Gaza deepens, in what were his first comments on the war. Nasrallah laid the blame for the current carnage in Gaza, where more than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed, at the feet of the United States.
'There is fear of an escalation or that [the Lebanese] front may lead to a broader war,' Nasrallah said. 'This is possible and the enemy must keep that in mind.'
For now, the war in Lebanon is secluded to the southern region. Nasrallah reminded viewers as much. 'They are saying [I] will announce we will enter the war,' he said. But 'we entered the battle from October 8th.'
More than 70 people have died on the Lebanese side since the start of hostilities. Most of those killed are Hezbollah fighters, though they include civilians and one Reuters journalist. Israel has said six soldiers and one civilian have died on their side, though Hezbollah claims it has killed or injured 120 Israeli soldiers.
The run-up to the speech had the country wrought in anxiety over the prospect of Lebanon entering a wider confrontation with Israel. For the moment, those fears have been allayed.
'For a lot of Lebanese, they may find some form of reassurance that we are not plunging into an all-out war,' Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based expert with the Atlantic Council, said.
'Nasrallah did say the defeat of Israel is a step-by-step approach and is not going to be done in a single blow.'
Some within Lebanon's political class, including caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, had been making statements about avoiding a wider war. Despite those efforts, many in Lebanon felt that any decision to take the country into war rested in the  .
Lebanon anxiously awaited Nasrallah's words after the speech was announced on October 29. Before the speech on Friday, many shops in Beirut closed early. Traffic was sparser than usual as many people either left work early or teleworked.
Group chats exchanged memes or anxious jokes about what Nasrallah would say. Large crowds gathered in Beirut's southern suburbs, south Lebanon and the country's eastern Bekaa Valley to watch the speech. Hezbollah enjoys a popular support base in all three areas.
In a cafe by Beirut's seafront, Haytham smoked a cigarette. 'Of course we're scared,' Haytham said, just minutes before Nasrallah appeared on screen wearing a black turban and dress. If Nasrallah decided to enter a wider war 'Israel could drop a bomb right here, where I'm sitting,' he added.
In his address, Nasrallah detailed the   along the Blue Line – the line that demarcates Lebanon from Israel – and said the current battle carried an unprecedented significance.
'What is happening on our front has not happened since 1948, even during the July 2006 war,' Nasrallah said. Days before the speech, Nasrallah had signed a handwritten letter demanding that all Hezbollah members killed in operations be declared "martyrs on the path to Jerusalem".
Nasrallah also said that Hamas had acted alone on October 7, dismissing suggestions that Iran or Hezbollah helped plan that attack. He also insisted that civilian deaths in the operation came at the hands of Israel and not Hamas, despite Amnesty International's claims  that they verified videos of Hamas shooting and killing civilians.
Although Nasrallah declared the current battle unprecedented, he used examples of resistance operations from the 1980s and the July 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. Despite thousands of casualties – mostly civilians – on the Lebanese side in 2006, Hezbollah's status was bolstered after withstanding 34 days of war against the Middle East's strongest army.
Nasrallah seemed to suggest that should Hamas withstand the Israeli barrage, it would signal a victory for the group similar to Hezbollah's in 2006. However, Nasrallah also indicated that should things escalate in Gaza, they would also heat up on the Lebanon border.
'It's almost a riposte to criticism from some Hamas leaders that Hezbollah is not doing enough,' Blanford said. 'He explained in some detail that Hezbollah's activities along the border have drawn a sizable number of troops, including elite forces, away from Gaza to look after Israel's northern border.'
Nasrallah seemed to indicate that as long as Hamas can hold out against Israel's military, there wouldn't need to be a need to intervene. 'Eliminating Hamas is an unachievable goal,' Nasrallah said.
In effect, Blanford said, Nasrallah made it clear that Gaza was still the primary front and Lebanon's border with Israel would remain secondary.
'When you cut through all the fire and bluster, it was a rational speech,' Blanford said. At the same time, however, Nasrallah 'obviously wasn't going to give any reassurances to the Americans or the Israelis' about avoiding an escalation, he said.

Can Lebanon's Hezbollah afford to go to war with Israel?
Newstex Blogs

October 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Lebanon's Hezbollah movement has warned that it is fully ready to fight against Israel after its fighters exchanged fire for days with Israeli soldiers on their border.
Both parties have   and rocket fire across their borders since the Palestinian armed faction Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 and killed about 1,400 people.
As violence escalates, observers fear that   may open a new front against Israel at the behest of its leaders and their Iranian backers. That scenario may relieve pressure on Hamas and beleaguered civilians in Gaza, but it would be devastating for Lebanon and costly for Israel, analysts told Al Jazeera.
Here's all you need to know about Hezbollah's military capabilities:
Has Hezbollah fought Israel before?
In July 2006, Hezbollah captured two Israeli fighters on its border which triggered a massive military response from Israel. The war lasted 34 days and  in the death of more than 1,100 Lebanese nationals and 165 Israelis.
Nobody conclusively won the war, but Lebanese civilians were the clear losers. Israel destroyed  or damaged about 30,000 homes, 109 bridges and 78 medical facilities, according to the International Committee for the Red Cross.
Nicolas Blandford, an expert on Hezbollah with the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, DC, said the group had 3,000 to 5,000 fighters and short-range missiles to hit Israel.
But over the last 17 years, Hezbollah has significantly improved its military capabilities.
'I think Hezbollah today has the ability to inflict the greatest damage on Israel [since the Jewish state was established] in 1948,' Blanford told Al Jazeera.
How strong is Hezbollah today?
Blanford estimated that Hezbollah has at least 60,000 fighters, including full-time and reservists. The group also increased its stockpile of missiles from 14,000 in 2006 to about 150,000 now, he said.
Most are short-range, Hezbollah also has Iranian precision-guided missiles that have a range of 300km (186 miles). Blanford added that Hezbollah's "special forces" unit is trained to infiltrate Israel in the event of a war.
'It's not a surprise perhaps that Israeli officials have over the last few years considered Hezbollah to be their primary threat,' he told Al Jazeera.
Randa Slim, the director of the Conflict and Resolutions Program at the Middle East Institute, also told Al Jazeera that the Syrian war - where Hezbollah intervened on the side of President Bashar al-Assad - enabled the group to improve its combat capabilities.
'In Syria, which was a prolonged war, they gained new skills in terms of urban warfare and intelligence. Their intelligence systems improved a lot,' she told Al Jazeera.
How likely is a Hezbollah-Israel war?
While limited border violence between Israel and Hezbollah is not unusual, Slim from the Middle East Institute believes that there is a greater risk for major escalation today.
She said Hezbollah and Iran may decide to open a second front against Israel depending on the level of atrocities committed in Gaza. If Hamas is about to be eradicated, Hezbollah could get involved, she added.
'Iran has brought together a loose collection of players to make up its 'resistance axis' which is now a cohesive machine,' Slim said. 'Hezbollah has talked about this idea - calling it the unification of fronts - which is like Article 5 of NATO: an attack on one is an attack on all. I don't think this was the case in the past.'
Despite the risks, Blanford believes that Iran and Hezbollah will exercise restraint. He explained that Hezbollah serves as a major deterrence against any possible Israeli and US plans to attack Iran.
'[If there is a war in Lebanon,] then Hezbollah would be battered and Iran would lose a key means of deterrence,' Blanford said.
However, he did not rule out the possibility of a war. He said   could still activate its proxies against Israel if it deems that now is the most opportune time to attack Israel.
The US is aware of the risk and has sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Iranian-backed groups from targeting Israel. Israel might have its own plans that exploit US diplomatic efforts and military to attack Hezbollah first, Blanford said.
Can Hezbollah Defeat Israel?
Hezbollah has the capacity to "inflict a terrible cost on Israel" but is still outmatched, said Slim.
She believes that the group can sustain an assault on Israel that devastates the country's critical infrastructure such as Ben-Gurion airport and major electricity grids. But in the end, Israel can reduce most of Lebanon to rubble.
'In Syria, the war was different. Hezbollah was fighting against various militias - funded by some Arab governments - but nothing compared to the mighty machine that is the Israeli military,' said Slim.
In any wider conflict, Israel will likely employ what it calls the "Dahiya Doctrine" - named after a civilian neighbourhood and a Hezbollah stronghold in south Beirut - which dictates the use of disproportionate force that targets civilian and military infrastructure.
Imad Salamey, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at the Lebanese American University, warned that a war against Hezbollah could lead to civil strife in Lebanon, which has been passing through economic and political crisis.
He said the migration of mostly Shia Lebanese citizens to majority Christian and Sunni cities in the north may trigger sectarian tensions, a view echoed by other observers.
Critics and opponents of Hezbollah may also explicitly blame the group - and its perceived supporters - for dragging the already beleaguered country into war.
'If [a war] happens, then it won't be like 2006,' Salamey told Al Jazeera. 'There will be fighting and resistance between communities domestically.'

Ceasefire or pause? Words UN members can't agree on to stop Israel's bombs

During a visit to Moscow on Friday, a member of a Hamas delegation   that the group won't release the captives taken during the October 7 attacks on Israel until a ceasefire agreement has been reached.
The news comes as the United Nations Security Council struggles to agree on whether to impose a ceasefire or a humanitarian pause allowing aid to flow to the Gaza Strip's besieged population - largely because of political differences among members.
On Wednesday, Russia and China vetoed a United States resolution calling for a "humanitarian pause". They wanted a "ceasefire", an option proposed   by Russia, which was yesterday vetoed by the United Kingdom and the US, both of whom are accustomed to shielding Israel from Security Council action.
Last week, the US vetoed a Brazilian-drafted resolution for "humanitarian pauses", arguing that it needed time for on-the-ground diplomatic efforts. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ), fewer than 70 trucks had been allowed entry into Gaza from the Rafah crossing with Egypt as of Tuesday night - a drop in the ocean.
Palestinians in Gaza have been deprived of food, water and medicine, especially since Israel announced a complete siege on the enclave, blocking the entry of all essential supplies before the recent trickle of aid.
UNRWA, the main UN agency in Gaza, on Wednesday   it will be forced to scale back its operations in the Strip if fuel isn't allowed in.
As the Security Council stalls, the UN General Assembly will vote on a non-binding draft resolution on Friday by the Arab group, which is calling for unrestricted humanitarian aid. European Union leaders will also be trying to reach a common position in Brussels - though positions in the bloc vary widely.
So what are the differences in the words that the world's nations are quibbling over, as Gaza awaits help?
Ceasefire
It essentially means that the fighting stops. A ceasefire is subject to agreement by all parties and usually involves a formal political process with commitments to de-escalate conflict, such as withdrawing weapons or repositioning forces. It tends to cover the entire geographical area on which the war is being waged. It may lead to a permanent settlement.
This is the long-term option rejected by the US, the UK and other countries, which back Israel's right to defend itself — by continuing its war on Gaza. By contrast, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has publicly called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
Samir Puri, a visiting lecturer on war studies at King's College London, thinks a ceasefire is "unimaginable" in the present circumstances, given that "a binding agreement with signatories and associated de-escalatory obligations" would be required."They take real effort to negotiate in the first place," he says.

Cessation of hostilities
Many use this term as a synonym for ceasefire. However, a cessation of hostilities is generally less structured. Agreements don't tend to cover issues like objectives, timelines, security and monitoring.
They enable parties to break from fighting as a step to talking and perhaps moving towards a sustained ceasefire. In this sense, cessation could be viewed as a potential stepping stone towards ending the war.
For Puri, this is a more realistic option for the UNSC.
"It could be agreed to quicker and is not expected to last, necessarily," he said.
Truce
It's the white flag option. The term truce is even looser than a cessation of hostilities, with no formal negotiations. Parties in conflict may have decided to take a break after intensive combat. By their very nature, truces may come and go during a conflict, sometimes applying to specific areas.
They can enable activities like the removal of the wounded or burial of the dead. It is understood that opposing forces should not change positions while a truce is in force.
Humanitarian pause
This refers to the temporary cessation of fighting, purely for humanitarian reasons. Pauses are sometimes confined to a specific geographical area where the humanitarian activities are being carried out. Usually in force for a defined period, a pause can last as little as a few hours.
The US's initial draft resolution omitted any mention of a pause, but underlined Israel's right to defend itself and demanded that Iran stop arming its proxies in the region. It toned down the version rejected on Wednesday, including a 'call for all measures necessary, such as humanitarian pauses'.
"A humanitarian pause would effectively be a truce to allow passage of aid or displaced people," says Puri.
Days of tranquility
This is a mechanism that would grant medics and other personnel access to war zones on specific days. It is often used by UNICEF to ensure that children have access to healthcare during conflict. It was first used in El Salvador in 1985 when the UN's children's agency negotiated a three-day break in fighting to enable children to be immunised.

Israeli Supreme Court holds first hearing challenging judicial overhaul

September 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
West Jerusalem – The Israeli Supreme Court has held its first hearing on petitions challenging the first pillar of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's divisive  .
Netanyahu's far-right government forced the bill – which curtails the power of the judiciary to strike down laws found by the court to be "extremely unreasonable" – through parliament in July despite   and strikes, including dissent within the military.
The session was held on Tuesday in front of all 15 members of the Supreme Court, for the first time in Israel's history, highlighting the importance the body is giving to the decision.
'   does not die with a few major blows, but rather with many small steps,' Israeli Supreme Court judge Isaac Amit said during the hearing.
The court eventually decided to give the lawyers in court 21 days to add to their argument.
Esther Hayut, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, sat in the middle of the Justices' semi-circular table where she led the hearing, facing a parallel table overflowing with lawyers representing the government, and a group of eight petitioners seeking to have the court overrule the bill.
The courtroom was filled to capacity with a mix of lawyers and politicians, including the German Ambassador to Israel, and was livestreamed.
Even though hearings of the Supreme Court are typically open to the public, on this occasion a security barrier was formed around the building to prevent protestors from disrupting the session, after tens of thousands rallied outside the Court on Monday night.
Democracy dying?
Inside the arched, white courtroom there were no visible political signs, although one of the respondents representing the Israeli Bar Association, Attorney Nadav Weisman, placed a copy of the book How Democracies Die on a table facing the Justices, alongside a stack of legal papers and notepads.
Kicking off the government's defence of its legislation was Attorney Yitzhak Bart. He argued that determining whether a bill was "unreasonable" – or what is known as the 'reasonableness clauses' – is too vague and liable for abuse. He also justified the drawn-out process to pass the bill, in which 14 hearings were held, as one that allowed diverse voices within the Knesset to weigh in on the new legislation before it was passed.
Hayut sparred with Bart, who claimed that the trend in Western democracies like Canada, Australia and England has been to expand similar clauses, even as the Israeli parliament sought to eliminate them.
One of Netanyahu's chief lieutenants, parliamentarian Simcha Rothman, cited scriptural verses from the Bible, among other arguments, to claim that the Supreme Court has no authority to oversee a law that limits its own judicial oversight and that the power of the elected parliament ought to be absolute in a democratic system.
Rothman was interrupted by Justice Anat Baron, who pressed him regarding a hypothetical case in which the Knesset 'decided that Arabs cannot vote, or that elections happen only once every 10 years'.
Rothman answered by insisting that such scenarios were implausible and that the Knesset itself can guarantee that all of its laws are 'reasonable' without the intervention of judges.
The Israeli parliament has, however, passed several laws that rights groups have criticised as attacking the human rights of Palestinians, in particular those living under Israeli occupation – and has actively supported the prolonging of the occupation.
Against the government, a group of eight respondents were also given the chance to argue in favour of repealing the controversial legislation in the marathon hearing, among them the Movement of Quality Government in Israel, and other advocacy organisations.
What comes next?
'It is the first time there is a real chance that the court will strike down a Basic Law,' explained Amichai Cohen of the Israel Democracy Institute to Al Jazeera, referring to quasi-constitutional legislation that are guiding principles of the country in lieu of a written constitution.
But it could take weeks or months for the Supreme Court to make a ruling in the case.
Next month, however, Hayat and Baron will automatically step down from the court after reaching the age limit of 70.
Some have speculated that Hayat could use the opportunity of her retirement from the court to leave a defiant message by striking down the law completely, but the court may avoid what would be a controversial decision setting it on a warpath with the government.
Meanwhile, the court is already scheduled next week to debate whether Israel's Judicial Selection Committee must be convened to vote in new justices, as has traditionally been the case.
The case comes after Justice Minister Yariv Levin refused to convene the committee with its current makeup, which he has called "invalid" for a democracy.
Among the government's planned controversial judicial reforms is an effort to give elected representatives more power to appoint new judges.

World Children's Day, celebrated annually on November 20 , is a global initiative promoting children's rights, safety, education, health and happiness.
It comes this year amid Israel's war on Gaza. About half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people are children.
Since October 7, Israeli attacks have killed at least 5,500  , according to Palestinian officials. That is one Palestinian child killed every 10 minutes, or about one out of every 200 children in the Gaza Strip.
An additional 1,800 children are missing under the rubble, most of them presumed dead. A further 9,000 children have been injured, many with life-changing consequences. Many of these children have lived through the   of multiple wars.
The infographic below lists the names and ages of less than half of those children killed over the past six weeks.

October 31st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
It took one tweet over the weekend for discord and disarray to emerge within the Israeli political establishment.
Just after midnight on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote that he had never been informed about warnings of Hamas's assault on Israel on October 7. Netanyahu instead seemed to place the blame for the attack, where at least 1,400 people were killed, on his army and intelligence chiefs. They had assessed prior to the attack that Hamas 'was deterred and ready for a settlement', he noted.
The statement caused an uproar. Political leaders slammed Netanyahu for playing politics while the country was in the midst of a difficult military campaign inside Gaza. The outrage was such that the prime minister deleted the tweet, and in an unusually sober tone  . 'I was wrong,' he said.
Experts say the episode confirmed a widening rift within the political and military establishment, one that questioned Netanyahu's leadership and his capacity to navigate the country through war without prioritising his own interests over national security.
'To say that he was out of order would be the understatement of the year,' said Yossi Mekelberg, associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Chatham House.
'This is a very difficult military campaign so you want a responsible prime minister and there is not a single person [in the government] that trusts Netanyahu – that's the main issue for this cabinet,' Mekelberg said.
Soon after October 7, Netanyahu formed an   by extending the Israeli governing coalition to a number of former senior military officers, drawn from the ranks of the opposition.
One of them was Benny Gantz, a former defence minister, who swiftly demanded Netanyahu retract his controversial post while showing full support to the army and the Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency.
A flurry of criticisms from other leaders followed. '[Netanyahu] is not interested in security, he is not interested in hostages, only politics,' said opposition lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman, once Netanyahu's defence minister. Israel army's top spokesperson Daniel Hagari declined to comment. 'We are at war,' he said.

The fiery exchanges were the latest signs of tension within Israel's political establishment – including within the war cabinet – as it grapples with the aftermath of one of the country's biggest intelligence failures.
Many in the country's security apparatus have admitted shortcomings, but not Netanyahu. Before the stormy tweet, the Israeli leader held a news briefing on Saturday where he dodged the question on whether he was responsible, saying that everybody will have to 'give answers to hard questions, including me', once the war is over.
'This is just the tip of the iceberg of what is going to be the Israeli establishment once the conflict is over,' said Alon Lien, former director of Israel's Foreign Ministry. 'He is preparing the ground for his argument,' Lien said.
Ties between the prime minister and a wide share of Israel's public opinion have already been tested. The war came on the heels of a political crisis as an ultra-nationalist far-right government led by Netanyahu pushed for   that curtailed the powers of the judiciary and that opponents have criticised as a threat to democracy. Tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets for months, pushing back against the judicial overhaul.
Among the opponents to the reform were military reservists who threatened to refuse to report for volunteer duty. Some critics argue that the magnitude of the protests was such that it impacted the military's readiness and capability.
Since October 7, thousands of reservists have embraced arms to join the fight against Hamas – the country's biggest military challenge since the   against Egypt and Syria.
On Monday, the Israeli army said troops and armoured vehicles were pushing deeper inside Gaza as part of the '  '. It comes after more than three weeks of relentless bombardments of the besieged enclave that have killed more than 8,000 Palestinians and triggered a humanitarian catastrophe.

But analysts say the unity within Israel against Hamas doesn't necessarily extend to support for Netanyahu's government itself.
'This government has already lost the confidence of a significant sector of the society before October 7 and it hasn't particularly expanded its public base of support since then,' said Mouin Rabbani, co-editor of Jadaliyya and non-resident fellow at the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies.
According to a poll by the Israeli Democracy Institute released last week, trust in the government collapsed to a 20-year low with 20 percent of Israelis saying they trusted Netanyahu's cabinet - eight percentage points lower compared with June.
Still, Netanyahu is known for his political survival skills. Israel's longest-serving prime minister first took office in 1996, and has been in power for 13 of the last 14 years.
'There is widespread opposition to him and his government's conduct, but this shouldn't get us blind to the fact that he has a deep reservoir of public support,' Rabbani said.
And though the war cabinet might be divided, expanding the government to include senior military members – as Netanyahu has done – could still serve his interests politically, he added.
It's a move that might not be aimed only atexpanding his political base, Rabbani said, but could also help him to more effectively deflect responsibility to the security establishment for potential military failures once the war is over.

'We won't leave': Armenians in Jerusalem push back against armed settlers

November 24th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Old City, occupied East Jerusalem – After learning that settlers had returned to bulldoze in an area of the parking lot near his house in the  , 80-year-old Garo Nalbandian, a professional photographer, joined a community sit-in in the area known as the Cows' Garden with, of course, his trusty camera.
'We won't leave,' a determined Nalbandian said gruffly in between snapping photos of Armenians on one side of the makeshift barricade and Israeli police and hired security on the other.
On October 26, the leader of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem announced it would cancel a once-secret 2021 land lease deal with a real estate company that has alleged links to settler interests.
Since then, representatives from the company, Xana Gardens, have sent contractors, armed settlers and bulldozers to seize the land – which, along with the parking lot, includes Armenian Church property and the homes of Nalbandian and four other families.
The 1,600-year-old Armenian community is concentrated in the confines of the Armenian Quarter, occupying 14 percent of the Old City of Jerusalem at its southwestern corner.
'You know all your neighbours. If I don't have milk at 1am, I just knock on their door. If I don't have bread, I call my friend,' said Setrag Balian, 26, one of the leaders of the current movement to reverse the land deal.
'We take care of each other's kids, of our families.'
This Armenian community – the oldest Armenian diaspora in the world – has seen its   from some 27,000 people a century ago to about 1,000 today.
Yet, with each attempted demolition, the community flocks in numbers at a moment's notice, standing in the way of bulldozers while withstanding threats of arrest and armed intimidation.
Nalbandian's family risks losing the home they've lived in since 1969, under the deal. Garo's wife, Hrout, whose family has been in Jerusalem as far back as the 8th or 9th century, describes her sweet memories of the decades of getting engaged, married and raising kids in their modest one-storey home.
'Wherever we walk, it's like we are in Armenia,' she said. 'We have like a big family for the Armenians. After so many years to become homeless, this is very hard.'
Garo's studio in Wadi al-Joz is adorned with breathtaking photos he has taken of streets and cities around the world, from Athens to Alexandria. 'But our beautiful Armenian Quarter is like nowhere else,' Garo remarked. 'We must protect it.'
The Armenian community is upset that their patriarchate agreed to the deal, which it has now scrapped under pressure [Al Jazeera]
A controversial deal
The community's suspicions of Israeli settler aspirations in the Cows' Garden started in 2019 when an Israeli company began construction on that same parking lot. At the time, the patriarchate told the community the aim was to renovate the lot, nothing more, but the parking lot's April 2021 inauguration was curiously attended by Moshe Lion, the mayor of Jerusalem, and bedecked with enough Israeli flags to raise eyebrows.
The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem – the community's spiritual leadership, biggest employer and de facto landlord – struck a deal in July that year with Xana Gardens, a company incorporated that same month and led by the Australian Israeli investor Danny Rothman.
For two years, church leaders kept the community in the dark about the terms or even existence of the deal, despite persistent rumours. On April 1 this year, witnesses say, Rothman – also known in documents as Danny Rubenstein and Danny Kaufman – came to the Cows' Garden parking lot with security, breaking security cameras and dismissing patriarchate guards, claiming he was taking over.
As years of rumours and suspicions about the deal spilled into the open, Setrag Balian and Hagop Djernazian, 23, led the younger generation of Armenians in fighting the land takeover. Balian, who works for his family's ceramics business, joined Djernazian, a student at Hebrew University, for months of protests near Armenian Patriarch Nourhan Manougian's offices.
'I see myself creating my future here,' said Djernazian, who also leads the Armenian Scouts. 'I study here, I work here, I live here. And this is my plan to continue living here. The deal threatens our continued existence here.'
A report in July this year by an international team of Armenian lawyers finally exposed the deal publicly.
In it, the patriarchate agreed to give Xana Gardens a 49-year lease – with an option to renew another 49 – of the Cows' Garden to build a luxury hotel.
Only Xana Gardens could cancel the agreement, which was for at least 11,500 square metres (123,785 square feet), but Xana could include 'adjacent properties in the project'.
A plan submitted by Danny Rothman to the Jerusalem Municipality in May sought 14,500sq metres – not 11,500 – for the hotel, with a 'target area' of 16,000sq metres (172,222sq feet), according to the report on the deal. Such an area would encompass 13 percent of the entire Armenian Quarter.
For this large swath of prized land on contested Mount Zion, Xana Gardens would pay only $300,000 in yearly rent.
Miran Krikorian, 40, a restaurant owner born and raised in the Armenian Quarter, says he pays nearly a quarter of that amount for only 30 square metres (323 square feet) he rents nearby for his small restaurant in the Christian Quarter.
'Either somebody got money under the table to pass this deal, or it's just our people are so dumb that they don't know the prices in this country,' said Krikorian.

Growing pressure, growing threats
For months, newly installed security guards from Xana Gardens threatened to ban community members from using the parking lot if they attended the protests, adding to threats church officials allegedly made towards individuals who protested. But the community refused to relent.
Pressure on the church to cancel the deal increased when Jordan and the Palestinian Authority withdrew their recognition of Patriarch Manougian in May, as they saw the deal threatening the status quo in the Old City, and amid concerns that stakeholders had not been consulted. The PA, Jordan and Israel are the three political authorities that endow recognition to the patriarchs in Jerusalem. The patriarchate did not respond to a request for comments.
'A lot of the younger generation had to learn through this ordeal why it's important to stay in Jerusalem and why presence matters,' said Kegham Balian, Setrag's brother who has written on the issue for Armenian news outlets.
Manougian's decision to cancel the deal on October 26 put to rest the Armenian community's internal divide on the issue. Later that same day, however, Israeli heavy machinery arrived at the disputed site to try to begin demolition.
Armenians rushed to the Cows' Garden, standing in front of machinery that was tearing up a pavement and a wall separating the patriarchate parking lot from the community parking lot.
Ten days later, on November 5, representatives from Xana Gardens, including Rothman, returned. This time, they brought about 15 settlers with them, several of them armed and leading leashed dogs.
'This is our land,' they reportedly told local Armenians. 'Leave now.'

But the Armenians refused to leave. A tense standoff ensued for hours, with more settlers arriving and yet more Armenians joining, eventually overwhelming the armed settlers.
Some of the settlers attempted to provoke community members, residents said. 'You're all goys, and when the Messiah comes, you will die,' one of them told them.
'I will get you, one by one!' George Warwar, a Christian Arab from Jaffa who had been the face of Xana Gardens on the ground in the months leading up to the encounter, reportedly shouted.
This was the first time most in the community had encountered Rothman, who, when approached by journalists, has refused to speak to the media. According to Setrag Balian, Rothman, who normally lives overseas, told police during the standoff the community wanted to cancel the deal because he is Jewish.

'It's because now you're bringing armed settlers and showing the true face of your company,' Setrag Balian recalled telling Rothman that day. 'It's because this deal is not a good deal for the patriarchate.
'We've lived with our Jewish Quarter neighbours for 50 years without any major incidents,' he continued.
The act of peaceful defiance forced Rothman and his group to withdraw after several hours.
'Just by the look on Danny Rothman's face,' said Kegham Balian, 'you could tell he wasn't expecting the events to unfold like they did that day.'

'It did not scare us – it empowered us'
Negotiations are under way for the church to provide greater transparency regarding the administration of community lands and affairs, a key demand from protesters.
With the internal divide on the land agreement now set aside – and the war in Gaza drawing the world's attention – Armenian residents say Xana Gardens' tactics are shifting to outright armed confrontation.
'They thought it would scare us,' said Setrag Balian of the armed threats. 'But it didn't scare us – it empowered us. We are more united than ever.'
Manougian, often criticised by Armenians for an absence in leadership, has been present during standoffs this month. A November 16 communique by the Armenian Patriarchate described the situation as 'possibly the greatest existential threat of its 16-century history', condemning the 2021 contract as 'tainted with false representation, undue influence, and unlawful benefits'.
Armenians fear their small, tight-knit community won't survive if they lose the Cows' Garden, which comprises much of the Armenian Quarter outside the Armenian Convent – a private area originally intended for clergy, but now housing many Armenians who moved there about a century ago in the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide.
The prized land is seen as pivotal to Israeli settler plans, as a long-term lease would complete a path for Jewish worshippers to cross the Old City from Jaffa Gate to the Jewish Quarter without crossing Christian properties, following   of the New Imperial Hotel and Petra Hotel along that route.
Since the first armed confrontation by Rothman and settlers, Armenians have been taking shifts at the Cows' Garden, where two bulldozers are parked.
Contractors hired by Xana Gardens attempted to bulldoze the area early in the morning on November 12 and 13. Both times, the community sprang into action, putting up a metal barricade on the 12 and, on the 13, standing in a bulldozer's path.
The community has remained nonviolent throughout the confrontations, at the behest of movement leaders like Balian and Djernazian.
As demolition attempts by the company continue – including an incident on November 15 in which Palestinians hired by Xana Gardens to dismantle the barricade left when they realised they had been hired by settlers – the community remains resolute.
During the standoffs, police threatened to arrest Armenians, and several have been arrested for transgressions like shouting, according to community members. They were released the same day, but banned by police from returning to the area.
Police have attempted to enforce the bulldozing efforts – although they have failed so far with Xana Gardens unable to present the required permits – before the land deal finds its way to court to be adjudicated, as stakeholders expect to happen.
A rotating group of Armenians now sleeps in the Cows' Garden at night, and community members provide volunteers with food, tea, couches and even a tent for 24/7 surveillance.
'This has to do with the future of my kid,' said Krikorian of his four-year-old boy, his eyes welling with tears.
'If I think about all those things that my kid is going to lose, like this community, like being with his friends … I grew up in that, and I want him to have the same experiences.
'If I don't do anything now, I'm going to lose it for him in the future.'

Analysis: A pause in fighting - what's in it for Hamas?

November 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The   that people on all sides of the fighting in Gaza and the international community anticipated and longed for has finally been agreed.
In many ways, it has been vague, starting with the time it was accepted by   – overnight on Wednesday and across 8 hours' worth of time zones between Qatar, the main intermediary, and Washington, the principal force pushing the Israeli cabinet, with its reluctant and eager ministers, to accept it.
The deal's designation is vague, possibly deliberately: The official statement from Qatar calls it a 'humanitarian pause' but media in the Arab world and Israel seem to prefer 'truce' or 'ceasefire', as does world media. Apart from the difference in meaning between those terms, this reflects how sensitive the weeks-long indirect negotiations must have been.
True to the uncomfortable and nervous relationship between Israeli and Hamas negotiators, even the duration is vague: Leaks during the last days of the indirect talks have ranged from three to five days. In the end, the span is in the middle, four days but, to add vagueness, the deal allows for the extension by one day for each extra batch of 50 captives Hamas releases.
The final ambiguity is when this difficult deal will come into force – that will be announced by the end of Wednesday.
Yesterday, I analysed what Israel has to gain and lose from the deal. The slight change now is that Netanyahu earned some brownie points with the Israeli public by presenting the Israeli cabinet with the deal, which he was most likely arm-twisted into by Joe Biden. Still, his political survival after the fighting in Gaza stops for good is far from being assured.
His initial public opposition to the first mentions of a deal indicated the opinion of the Israeli extreme right wing, politically mostly directed by Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and their patrons in the Knesset and cabinet. To them, Hamas are terrorists to be killed, eradicated and expelled from the Gaza Strip with captives being released either voluntarily or by force, and they took any suggestion of negotiating with Hamas as an insult and an offence.
Having become the party that negotiates with the State of Israel, even if through intermediaries, Hamas gained political acceptance in the international community. In just six weeks since October 7, its status changed from 'terrorists with whom any negotiations are unacceptable' to 'an organisation that has control on the ground'.
Even though Israel and the United States continue calling it 'terrorist', a term that usually connotes 'people we do not negotiate with', they have recognised reality and accepted the Palestinian organisation as their opposite side in negotiations.
To be sure, Hamas and Israel have negotiated truces in the past, always through third-party mediation, usually that of Egypt. But those were tactical battlefield issues rather than full-fledged international agreements involving several states.
Hamas scored an important psychological, political and strategic victory: The Israeli cabinet and the US president have negotiated with Hamas, reached an agreement and said publicly they intend to honour it. Two months ago, today's reality would have been unimaginable.
But, on the military side, Hamas has little to gain from the pause/ceasefire/truce. As I explained yesterday, it is militarily very convenient for Israel but makes no real difference for Hamas, despite fears voiced by the Israeli public that it would use the opportunity to regroup.
Unlike Israel, which has a conventional army that fights on the ground and whose progress can be easily followed by plotting the positions of its armoured formations on commercially available satellite photos, the   are almost untraceable from the air.
They move lightly, on foot aboveground, or underground through the network of tunnels crisscrossing the Strip. Their weapons, apart from multiple-rocket launchers, are small and portable, so they can be moved via the tunnels.
By keeping the uniformed fighters and their easily movable weaponry underground, Hamas largely stays beyond the reach of most conventional means of detection. Hamas command centres are under the ground, Hamas armouries are below the surface, and Hamas tunnels connect those with almost every point in the Gaza Strip – so why would Hamas need a pause in the fighting to regroup if it can do so anyway?
Certainly, it will exploit the four quiet days, if they indeed happen, to its military advantage, but that is an opportunistic, tactical chance rather than a strategic necessity.
If the ceasefire holds, Hamas will be able to reduce the number of fighters on lookouts, in ambushes and on operational readiness, giving its fighters some much-needed rest and a possibility to dash for a brief reunion with their families wherever in Gaza they may be.
Both militaries will need to be on alert during the pause as the realities on the ground are often much different than the beliefs and expectations of those who imagine the battlefield from afar and negotiate from secure offices and comfortable international hotels.
In most wars that I witnessed, ceasefires were broken, often by unpredictable and uncontrollable events on the ground. The shortest internationally brokered ceasefire I remember, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, lasted a full one minute and 17 seconds if my memory serves me right.
Any hothead with a gun, and there are more than 50,000 such potential own decision-makers, can decide that he has a reason to take any of his grudges to his enemies. If just one soldier lets off a few bullets, he may jeopardise all hopes of four days with nobody getting killed, some civilians getting to safety, much-needed aid coming in, restoration of some civilian infrastructure and freeing of captives and prisoners.
Having surmounted all the difficulties to clinch the deal, the world can now just pray that the commanders on both sides can, for 96 hours, exercise full and effective control of their forces. Down to the last fool!

'What's wrong?': The silence of Pakistanis on expulsion of Afghan refugees

November 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Islamabad, Pakistan – They were a common sight across major Pakistani cities, performing low-paying wage work – loading goods at markets, pushing carts on streets to sell fruits and vegetables, or picking trash.
But since the beginning of the month, those Afghans have been missing from public view after the Pakistan government   on undocumented refugees and migrants, nearly 1.7 million of them from the neighbouring country.
Air conditioner technician Raza Ali, who works in a major electronics market in Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city in the eastern Punjab province, told Al Jazeera he was "not friends with them, but they were always around".
"But since the government started its crackdown, they just vanished. It could be good for us because now our people can do their jobs,' the 31-year-old told Al Jazeera.
'Look, they were not from here. If the government is sending them back to their own country, what is wrong with that? I think this is the right decision. Besides, I did not know them. It does not make any difference to my life,' he added nonchalantly.
Ali's sentiments perhaps explain the muted response of common Pakistanis to the  , many of whom were born in Pakistan and had never seen Afghanistan.
The Afghan migration to Pakistan began in the late 1970s after the Soviets invaded their country. Then, the Afghans came in more waves after the United States attacked Afghanistan in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the more recent Taliban takeover of Kabul in 2021.
The Pakistani government, whose expulsion campaign began on November 1, says 1.7 million of nearly 4 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan were undocumented. Islamabad   for a recent spike in attacks by armed groups, most of them carried out by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as Pakistani Taliban because of its ideological affinity with the Afghan Taliban.
Pakistan's caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti, the top government official supervising the expulsion drive, last month alleged that 14 out of 24 suicide bombings in the country this year were carried out by Afghan nationals.
Last week, he told the parliament more than 300,000 Afghans left the country this month, despite criticism from the United Nations and rights groups over forcibly driving the refugees and migrants away.
But there is no visible outrage over the move within Pakistan – a silence being contrasted by their anger over Israel's forced displacement – and what many experts call a genocide – of Palestinian civilians in 
'Great deal of racism'
Gallup Pakistan, in a survey conducted in the first week of November, found that 84 percent of respondents 'strongly approved' the government's move to expel the 'illegal' refugees and migrants, mainly from Afghanistan.
Moreover, an overwhelming 64 percent of the respondents said the repatriation of the Afghans would lead to improved security and peace in Pakistan.

Muhammed Rehan, a bookshop owner in Karachi, the country's largest city and a refuge for tens of thousands of Afghans, said while the government decision may have been guided by the 'frustration' over its inability to control the increasing violence, he agreed with the reasoning of their expulsion.
'The decision to repatriate undocumented people is the correct one. There are a lot of criminal elements among them, and police must take care that they only arrest those who are without papers or those who have committed any crime,' he told Al Jazeera.
Similarly, Adil Musa, a real estate dealer in the capital Islamabad, also endorsed the government's decision, saying it will help the law and order situation.
'These Afghan families also impacted the rental market in Islamabad, making it difficult for the locals to acquire property,' he told Al Jazeera.
But Pakistani sociologist Nida Kirmani believes there is a 'great deal of racism' against the Afghans in Pakistan, which she says is due to years of 'state-sponsored brainwashing' that framed the Afghans as enemies.
Kirmani, associate professor of sociology at Lahore University of Management Science, told Al Jazeera the Pakistani state portrays the Afghans as 'terrorists', even when the state apparatus itself was central to the growth of groups such as the Taliban in Afghanistan.
'Many people here have bought into these narratives. Plus, at times of economic insecurity and upheaval, we often see a rise in xenophobic discourses and movements. The current scenario is part of this general trend, and Afghans become easy scapegoats,' she said.
Karachi-based lawyer Sara Malkani claims there was "some resistance" by the civil society groups to the government's decision. One reason for the muted public outrage, she said, could be because of the fears of state suppressing mass anti-government protests.
'There is public sympathy in some quarters, and there are activists who are trying to demand the government should bring more transparency in the [expulsion] processes, but there is a need to educate people on why Afghans chose to escape Afghanistan and what role did the Pakistani state play in perpetuating the conditions in Afghanistan,' she told Al Jazeera.
Malkani said it is important to change the public perception within Pakistan about the Afghans, who are going back to a country impoverished by decades of conflict and which is now facing a political and humanitarian crisis.
'Under the current Taliban government, we are already seeing widespread gender apartheid, with girls denied the right to education and women denied the right to employment and mobility. It is unconscionable to forcibly deport them [to face these problems],' she said.

Taiwan takes security lessons from Hamas, Ukraine surprise attacks

October 29th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Taichung, Taiwan – On October 7, the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, firing thousands of rockets that quickly overwhelmed Israel's state-of-the-art Iron Dome air defence system while thousands of fighters infiltrated southern Israel by air, sea and land.
The significance of Hamas's surprise attack was not lost on Taiwan's military, which lives with a promise by Beijing's political leaders to unify self-ruled Taiwan with China,  .
In the week after Hamas's raid on Israel, the Taiwanese defence ministry announced the establishment of a task force to draw lessons from the Israel-Gaza war.
Taiwan's defence minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, has said that an initial lesson is that intelligence gathering will be key to counter China's threats.
Taiwan also has the sea, said 42-year-old Tony Wei, who is a member of the Taiwanese reserves and a dentist by profession.
Taiwan is separated from China's east coast by a 130-kilometre (81-mile) stretch of ocean known as the Taiwan Strait which acts as a natural barrier and early warning system should Beijing try to overwhelm Taiwan in a surprise attack.
"To invade Taiwan, they (the Chinese military) have to gather a very large fleet," Wei told Al Jazeera.
China's mobilisation of such a naval force would probably be detected by Taiwan, giving the self-ruled island time to ready for an invasion or even launch a preemptive attack, Wei said.
Still, the Hamas raid – largely considered unimaginable by military analysts before it happened – has made Wei question whether Taiwan truly possesses the   necessary to counter a potentially determined Chinese military.
"The Israelis have a very powerful military, an effective intelligence service and a lot of American support," Wei said."If even Israel can be surprised and overwhelmed, then what about Taiwan?"

The Israel-Gaza war is the second time the world has recently been taken aback by a military operation considered improbable until it was carried out.
"They said that President Putin wouldn't attack Ukraine, but he did, and they said that Hamas couldn't attack Israel, but they did," Wei said, referring to the   of February 2022.
"Taiwan needs to learn from these attacks in case our island becomes the next place where the unthinkable happens."
Surprise attacks: Knowing before, responding after
'Hamas's attack achieved strategic, operational, and tactical surprise against the Israelis,' Eric Chan, a non-resident research fellow at the Global Taiwan Institute, told Al Jazeera.
'Taiwan has a vested interest in avoiding this type of surprise, especially because their adversary has greater powers than Hamas,' Chan said.
'The Russian invasion, as well as the surprise attack by Hamas, was an object demonstration that while you may think that the adversary is deterred by high costs, the adversary may actually not care,' he added.
Fang-Yu Chen, an assistant professor at Soochow University in Taipei who researches political relations between Taiwan, China and the US, said that Taiwan's announced establishment of a task force in the aftermath of the Hamas attack was an attempt to learn lessons in order to prevent a Taiwanese intelligence failure with regards to China.
'Taiwan is constantly picking up a lot of information about China's activities, but such information has to be verified, analysed and passed on to the right people,' Chen told Al Jazeera.
According to Chen, Taiwan might look to strengthening its intelligence gathering in order to ensure that credible threats from China are clearly identified before a potential disaster strikes.
'The next major consideration is what to do after an attack has already taken place,' he said.
Taiwan's government has taken steps in that direction, too.
More money is being allocated to the military; compulsory military service for Taiwanese citizens is being extended from four months to one year; the purchase of new missile systems was announced, and the island's   was also unveiled earlier this month.
In its preparations, Taiwan has also looked to and learned from the war in Ukraine, according to Chen.
A major lesson of Russia's invasion is the importance of not only strengthening the island's conventional military and intelligence but also its capabilities within the field of information warfare in order to win the battle of the narrative, he said.
War of narratives
Chen has observed that   directed at Taiwan have adjusted since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
'Before the Ukraine war, the propaganda was often about how the US will abandon Taiwan, but after the war, it has been about how the US is pushing China towards war,' he said.
At the same time, Chen has detected a polarisation of public opinion in Taiwan with people who were already willing to fight against Chinese aggression becoming more willing to confront Beijing while those who were unwilling to fight have become even less willing.
Amid this   and efforts to influence personal resolve among the Taiwanese, Taiwan's government last year launched a ministry of digital affairs which has since introduced a range of measures to combat disinformation directed at the island and its population.
In the battle of narratives it is not just a matter of countering disinformation that reaches Taiwan, said Wei, the military reservist, but also about how Taiwan obtains the backing of other countries.
Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has also taken certain preliminary steps to accomplish this by encouraging the island to tell its own story to the world. Through the 'Give Taiwan a Voice' campaign, her administration has protested against Taiwan's exclusion from the United Nations and sought to highlight the island's contributions to the international community.
At the same time, Tsai has sought to reach out to and integrate Taiwan more extensively with countries in South and Southeast Asia through a so-called 'southbound policy' under the slogan of 'Taiwan helps Asia, Asia helps Taiwan'.
Wei believes such initiatives are important if Taiwan is to win over world opinion in the face of increasing pressure from China.

For Wei, the importance of winning the narrative was highlighted in the information battle that broke out between Israel and Hamas over responsibility for the deadly explosion at the  .
The fight to convince the world of the magnitude and responsibility for the hospital atrocity had far-reaching consequences as meetings between US President Joe Biden – Israel's staunchest ally – and several Arab leaders were cancelled amid a global outcry over the attack.
As Wei said, no one supports someone who bombs hospitals, and no one can win a war without assistance from the outside.
Winning the information war, he said, will be crucial for Taiwan in any potential confrontation with China.
'So, we must win the war of words so that we can count on international support if Chinese bombs strike Taiwan.'

Hundreds of people in Russia's Dagestan region angry at Israeli bombardment of Gaza   on Sunday as a flight from Tel Aviv landed.
The Makhachkala airport was forced to close after some of the protesters made it to the runway while some others were heard chanting anti-Jewish slogans.
At least 60 people have been arrested following the clashes between protesters and police at the airport.
Here is what we know so far about what happened at the Dagestan airport protest.
What happened?
At 7pm local time (4:00pm GMT) on Sunday, a Russian Red Wings airline flight from the Israeli city of Tel Aviv landed at Makhachkala airport, according to Flightradar24.
Hundreds of protesters broke through security to make it to the runaway and inundate the area around the parked Russian carrier. Social media videos show crowd members breaking down glass doors and running through the airport. Some were also chanting anti-Jewish slogans, waving Palestinian flags or checking the passports of arriving passengers.
At about 10pm (19:00 GMT) the protesters were cleared from the runway, according to security officials.
The Israeli passengers were isolated and guarded, according to Israeli media outlets citing Israeli security officials.
The transiting flight took off for Moscow two hours after arrival, according to independent Russian media outlet Sota.
Early on Monday, Russia's interior ministry said, "More than 150 active participants in the unrest have been identified, 60 of them have been arrested,' although it is not clear if any official charges have been issued yet, according to the Associated Press news agency.
Where did it happen?
The protest took place at Makhachkala airport, the major airport in Russia's Republic of Dagestan. Makhachkala, the republic's capital and largest city, lies on the coast of Dagestan.

Did anyone get injured?
Twenty people have been injured with two in a critical condition, according to AP. Nine of those injured were police officers who clashed with the crowd.
What is the latest on the ground?
Russia's aviation agency, Rosaviatsiya, said Makhachkala airport will be closed until Tuesday, according to Agence France-Presse. Earlier, they had said all flights to and from Makhachkala airport will be suspended until November 6.
The airport is "now totally under the control of security forces" according to a statement from Russia's interior ministry.
The airfield has also been cleared of unauthorised people while incoming flights have been redirected to airports nearby, said Rosaviatsiya.

What are people saying?
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expecting Russian law enforcement to "act resolutely against the rioters and against the wild incitement directed against Jews and Israelis", according to a statement released by his office on Sunday night.
Russia's government warned protesters through Telegram 'not to continue illegal acts and not to interfere with the work of airport employees'.
Dagestan's Supreme Mufti Sheikh Akhmad Afandi told residents that although he understands their "indignation," the issue cannot be resolved this way. He asked residents to not rally but exert "maximum patience and calm", in a video shared to Telegram.
A White House spokesperson condemned the incident saying the United States 'unequivocally stands with the entire Jewish community as we witness a worldwide surge in anti-Semitism'.
What do we know about the region?
The republic has a majority Muslim population and is home to more than 50 different nationalities and ethnicities. It is also known as "the Mountain of Languages" or "Mountain of Nationalities".
About 1,000 years ago, it served as Islam's gateway to Russia and for almost a decade until 2017, when Russian security forces in the region were battling an armed rebellion.
Dagestan currently channels major oil and gas pipelines from the Caspian Sea to the Russian heartland.
What did the Kremlin say about the violence?
Russia on Monday blamed "external interference" for the airport violence.
"Yesterday's events at Makhachkala airport are, to a large extent, the result of external interference," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
"Against the backdrop of TV footage showing the horrors of what is happening in the Gaza Strip – the deaths of people, children, old people, it is very easy for enemies to take advantage of and provoke the situation," Peskov told reporters on Monday.
The Kremlin did not provide further details on its claim of "external interference".
Peskov added that President Vladimir Putin was due to hold a meeting with his top advisers, including the defence minister and spy chiefs, later on Monday to discuss "the West's attempts to use the events in the Middle East to split Russian society".
State media earlier cited Dagestan's governor as saying the "initiators of this action are our enemies who organised it from Ukrainian territory".
What is Russia's stance on the Israel-Hamas war?
Russia's President Vladimir Putin condemned Hamas's October 7 attack while also likening Israel's blockade of Gaza to a Nazi Germany siege.
  that Putin is "not pro-Israel" and looking for the conflict to escalate so that it shifts global attention away from the Russia-Ukraine war.
At the United Nations, Russia has presented two unsuccessful   to the UN Security Council, calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, and the release of all captives held by Hamas. Its resolutions have received a backlash from some states for not mentioning Israel's right to self-defence.

Five takeaways from the Biden-Xi summit at California's Filoli Estate

November 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping spent some four hours together on Wednesday in their first face-to-face meeting in a year.
As they convened at the Filoli Estate in northern California, the two leaders were aiming to make some headway in rebuilding ties strained over a whole host of issues – from trade to Taiwan,   and the pandemic.
Biden talked of "  " after the meeting, where talks continued over a lunch of ravioli, chicken and broccolini, and during a stroll around the estate's manicured gardens.
China's state media described a "candid and in-depth exchange of views".
Here are five takeaways from the talks:
Military and personal communication
In probably the most substantive outcome of the talks, the two leaders agreed to resume military contacts that China severed after the then Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022.
According to the Pentagon's most recent report on  , Beijing had "denied, cancelled or ignored" military-to-military communications and meetings with the Pentagon, which raised "the risk of an operational incident or miscalculation spiralling into crisis or conflict".
The Biden-Xi agreement means that US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will be able to speak to his Chinese counterpart once someone is named to the job, a senior US official told reporters, and that similar engagements would be possible up and down the military chain of command.
The Pentagon welcomed the move and said it was key to avoiding inadvertent conflict.
"Maintaining open lines of communication between our two militaries is essential to avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations that could lead to crisis or conflict," a Pentagon spokesperson said.

The US president also emphasised the importance of open communications between the two presidents.
"He and I agreed that each one of us can pick up the phone call directly, and we'll be heard immediately," Biden told reporters after the meeting.
Biden and Xi have had a long working relationship, dating from when they were both vice presidents.
"It was 12 years ago," Xi said in brief public remarks. "I still remember our interactions very vividly, and it always gives me a lot of thoughts."
Biden also emphasised the length of their relationship and the value of those interactions.
"We haven't always agreed, which was not a surprise to anyone, but our meetings have always been candid, straightforward and useful," Biden said.
Taiwan
According to China's state broadcaster, the island of Taiwan was a key area of discussion for Xi.
Beijing claims the self-ruled democracy as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to take control of the island.
The United States, on the other hand, while maintaining formal diplomatic relations with Beijing, follows a policy of "  " on Taiwan and is the island's main source of weapons.
A US official described the talks as 'clear-headed' and 'not heated' withBiden chiding China over its massive military build-up around the island and declaring the US was committed to continuing to help Taiwan defend itself.
For his part, Xi insisted thatthe island was part of China.
'The US side should stop arming Taiwan, and support China's peaceful reunification,' Xi told Biden, according to China's Foreign Ministry. 'China will realise reunification, and this is unstoppable.'
Taiwan is one of China's so-called "red lines" in discussions and it has reacted angrily to visits by US and other Western politicians, as well as to overseas engagements by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and her deputy  .
Lai is currently the frontrunner in elections due in January, and during Wednesday's talks, Biden urged China to respect Taiwan's electoral process.
Economic issues
The economy – both at home and abroad – was the other main priority for Xi, according to state media.
As they began their talks, Xi noted that a lot had happened since the two men last met in Bali.
"The world has emerged from the COVID pandemic but is still under its tremendous impacts. The global economy is recovering, but its momentum remains sluggish," he said.
Describing the US-China relationship as "the most important bilateral relationship in the world", Xi said he and Biden "shoulder heavy responsibilities" and that they could not turn their backs on each other.
China's recovery from the pandemic has been hampered by its growing debt and an ageing population, but it has also been affected by sanctions and US   for sensitive equipment.
"Stifling China's technological progress is nothing but a move to contain China's high-quality development and deprive the Chinese people of their right to development," a readout from the Chinese side quoted Xi as saying. "China's development and growth, driven by its own inherent logic, will not be stopped by external forces."
The two leaders also spoke about developments in artificial intelligence (AI).
Here, the senior US official said both sides were "very much focused" on practices regarding AI that could be dangerous or destabilising, but not ready for any mutual declaration.
Fentanyl
There was progress in efforts to tackle the production of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is the leading cause of drug overdoses in the US.

Xi agreed to help stem the export of chemicals related to the production of illicit fentanyl and go after specific chemical companies.
"It's going to save lives, and I appreciated President Xi's commitment on this issue," Biden said at a press conference after his meeting.
Biden added he would "trust but verify" Chinese actions on the drug.
Middle East
Xi and Biden touched on the ongoing war in Gaza as the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling for extended humanitarian "  " in the besieged enclave.
More than 11,300 Palestinians have been killed in   on the territory since October 7 when the armed group Hamas led a surprise assault on Israel killing more than 1,200 people and taking more than 200 others  .
Amid concerns about the potential for a regional escalation, Biden asked China to weigh in with Iran, which backs Hamas, and urge it to avoid steps that could be seen as provocative, according to the US official.

'Will we return': For my Palestinian family, history is repeating itself

October 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Deir el-Balah, Gaza — On the eighth day, my family and I awoke still in shock, finding ourselves in a new location within the Gaza Strip, the town of Deir el-Balah in the south of the enclave.
The harrowing scenes from the previous day remained etched in our minds. During the early hours of the previous day, while intense bombings continued to shake Gaza, journalists in WhatsApp groups began discussing rumours of Israeli calls for residents of the northern and central Gaza Strip to  .
Some journalists initially dismissed this as Israeli psychological warfare meant to intimidate people.
For a brief moment, I shifted my focus from the ongoing   around us to verifying the credibility of this news, which had been reported by some international agencies. My anxiety mounted as I moved from room to room in our house, searching for a stable internet connection amid communications and power outages.
When the internet reconnected, the definitive news arrived: the Israeli army spokesperson, Avichai Adraee, officially announced the order on his Facebook page.
This brought about moments of confusion, disbelief, and disorientation. I rushed to wake my husband, but he remained silent in response. Wary of disturbing my parents, who had endured a restless night, I contacted my brothers instead.
My younger brother's immediate response was a mix of inquiry and concern: "What should we do? What does this mean?"
My husband's one word — emphasising the importance of our children — dispelled my confusion and underscored the urgency of the situation. The images of innocent children and infants killed in previous bombings weighed heavily on my mind.
Yet, the question persisted: Where would we go? We faced a dilemma, as my husband's family had relatives in Nuseirat in central Gaza, while my own family had connections in Deir el-Balah.
After much debate, my husband's family decided to head to Nuseirat, swayed by the insistence of mothers on leaving to protect their children.
It became evident that the welfare of children was the primary factor influencing the decision amid these chaotic and perilous times.
I reached out to my brother again, stressing the need to move our family and parents to my grandfather's house in Deir el-Balah.
He readily accepted. At eight in the morning, I continued to prepare, watching the news, periodically calling my family and repacking my bags.
However, a new challenge emerged: how would we all be transported? I didn't own a car, and the majority of Gaza residents lacked access to private vehicles. Frustration and tension swelled as we contemplated the scale of Israel's decision to relocate so many people to the south.
As my husband reached out to his uncles to secure transport for the family to Nuseirat, my father called to inform me that he was on his way to pick up my mother and sisters. He offered to return to take me, my children, my husband, and the rest of the family to Deir el-Balah.
With a sigh of relief and a glimmer of hope, I felt a growing sense of clarity as my father's call marked a turning point.
My husband and I focused on packing essential supplies, including food, water, canned goods, diapers and baby formula. Uncertainty loomed, prompting us to prepare for the unknown. Alongside our belongings, I packed a photo album, extra clothing for our children, children's books for entertainment, a blanket, and a first-aid kit.
Unlike previous evacuations, my emotions felt distinct, as if this were not just a temporary departure but a permanent migration. My husband's pessimistic remark that we might not return hung in the air, making me question the uncertain path ahead.
As the events unfolded rapidly around me, I struggled to process the blurry landscape before us. Outside, I watched neighbours loading their belongings onto transport trucks.
Amid a heated discussion with my husband, our daughter Baniyas, who had awakened from her sleep, interrupted us with a simple question: Why were we packing bags? My husband gently explained that we had to leave because of Israel's threat to bomb our area, and we would be heading to Deir el-Balah. Baniyas, though reluctant, eventually accepted, her father reassuring her that we hoped to return soon.
My father, accompanied by my brother, arrived to transport me, my husband, our children, and our belongings to Deir el-Balah. A profound sadness, helplessness and confusion washed over me as I carried our baby, my husband held Baniyas's hand, and my brother helped with the bags.
Tears welled up as we descended the stairs, and countless thoughts swirled in my mind, chiefly among them:  ? Would our homes be destroyed?
I entered the car with a heavy heart, and silence enveloped us all. I sat in the back with one bag in hand, beside Baniyas, while my husband held our baby, and my brother managed the rest of our belongings. The road was congested with citizens seeking transport.
People with packed bags stood at street intersections searching for rides, and some walked or rode in trucks. The homes and streets we passed bore scars of devastation from Israeli strikes.
I called a friend along the way to inquire about the safest routes that had not yet been destroyed, to help us reach Deir el-Balah. We eventually reached the Salah al-Din Road, which links the Gaza Strip to the southern governorates.
The scene along this route was both striking and heart-wrenching. Families, children, and men with their belongings walked alongside the road. A seemingly  , overloaded with possessions and passengers beyond capacity, made their way forward. The tops of these vehicles were piled high with bedding and mattresses.
Our journey continued until we reached the entrance to Deir el-Balah. Although the trip should have taken half an hour, it lasted an hour and a half due to the road conditions.
We navigated through narrow streets, eventually arriving at my grandfather's house in the city centre.
We were not the only ones seeking refuge there; our relatives had also gathered. My uncle stood there, welcoming everyone. The neighbouring houses were similarly receiving displaced people from Gaza City.
When I entered my grandfather's home, the first sight that greeted me was his portrait hanging on the wall. My grandfather had been displaced during the Nakba of 1948 from the village of Isdud — what Israel now calls Ashdod — and passed away in 2002 without realising his dream of returning.
Now, his grandchildren found themselves displaced and evicted in the year 2023. The old house, which had been closed for years, opened its doors to accommodate us as refugees in our own land.
From inside the house, I heard the roar of a new air strike, prompting me to tell my mother that today: "History repeats itself."

Families of Hamas hostages worry over loved ones as Israel pummels Gaza

As Israel bombards Gaza with missiles, the families of those held hostage by Hamas grapple with the knowledge that it could come at the cost of their loved ones' lives.
The group that rules Gaza has warned it will kill one of the 130 hostages every time Israel's military bombs civilian targets in Gaza without warning.
Hamas fighters took the hostages mostly from a music festival in the Nir Oz kibbutz in the Israeli Negev desert on Saturday after blowing through Israel's heavily fortified separation fence and crossing into the country from Gaza.
The captives include Israeli soldiers and civilians along with foreigners. Hamas has said it seeks the release of all Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails – about 4,500 detainees, according to Israeli human rights group B'Tselem – in exchange for the captives.
According to the ZAKA rescue service, 260 people were also killed on the Supernova electronic music festival grounds.

Soon after the news broke, Ahal Besorai learned from witnesses that the fighters had seized his sister, her husband and their teenage son and daughter, along with dozens of others.
'Should I cry because they are dead already? Should I be happy because maybe they are captured but still alive?' Ahal Besorai, a life coach and resort owner who lives in the Philippines and grew up in the Be'eri kibbutz, told the Associated Press news agency. 'I pray to God every day that she will be found alive with her family and we can all be reunited.'
Ahuwa Maizel told the DPA news agency that he is looking for his daughter.
'I don't know if my daughter is lying somewhere bleeding, I don't know if they took her to Gaza, I don't know if she is suffering,' he said, adding that the last time he spoke to his daughter Adi was on Saturday morning.
'There is a massacre here, they are causing a massacre, hundreds of terrorists are shooting,' Adi told Maizel during their brief conversation.
'If someone is holding her captive, please, please, stay human. We all have the same DNA, we are all just human,' Maizel said.
Eli Elbag said he woke on Saturday to text messages from his daughter, Liri, 18, who had just begun her military training as an army lookout at the Gaza border.
The fighters were shooting at her, she wrote. Minutes later, the messages stopped. By nightfall, a video circulated by Hamas showed her crowded into an Israeli military truck overtaken by fighters. The face of a hostage next to Liri was marred and bloodied.
'We are watching television constantly looking for a sign of her,' Elbag said. 'We think about her all the time. All the time wondering if they're taking care of her, if they're feeding her, how she's feeling and what she's feeling.'
For Israel, locating hostages in Gaza may prove difficult. Although the strip is tiny, subject to constant aerial surveillance and surrounded by Israeli ground and naval forces, the territory just over an hour from Tel Aviv remains somewhat opaque to Israeli intelligence agencies.
Fighters posted videos of the hostages, and families were left in agony wondering about their fate.
Yosi Shnaider has wrestled with worry since his family members were kidnapped from Nir Oz. He saw a video of his cousin and her two young boys held hostage.
'It's like an unbelievable bad movie, like a nightmare,' Shnaider said on Monday. 'I just need information on if they are alive,' he added.
Also missing is his aunt who requires medicine to treat her diabetes and Parkinson's disease. Since the family found out they were taken hostage, the woman's sister has been so mortified that she is 'like a zombie, alive and dead at the same time', said Shnaider, a real estate agent in the Israeli city of Holon.
Warning to Hamas
Israel's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said the country is committed to bringing the hostages home and issued a warning to Hamas.
'We demand Hamas not to harm any of the hostages," he said. 'This war crime will not be forgiven.'
Uncertainty also weighs heavily on families who still do not know whether their relatives have been killed, taken into Hamas captivity, or have escaped and are on the run.
Tomer Neumann, whose cousin was attending a music festival near the Gaza border and has since vanished, hopes it is the last of the three options.
The cousin, Rotem Neumann, who is 25 and a Portuguese citizen, called her parents from the festival when she heard rocket fire, he said.
She piled into a car with friends, witnesses said, but fled when they encountered trucks filled with fighters. Later, her phone was found near a concrete shelter.
'All we have is bits and pieces of information,' said Neumann, who lives in Bat Yam, a city just south of Tel Aviv.
'What now is on my mind is not war and is not bombing,' he said. 'All we want is to know where Rotem is and to know what happened to her and we want peace.'
Thai captives
The families of Thai labourers who are among the hostages spoke to the AFP news agency on Tuesday of their fears for their safety.
Kanyarat Suriyasri, whose husband Owat Suriyasri is among those taken, recounted her horror at learning the news.
"When I heard that he was among the 11 hostages taken by Hamas my heart dropped," she said. "I am waiting to hear some good news."
Owat, 40, from Sisaket province in eastern Thailand, is a "very friendly, caring and happy man", she said.

Ukraine battles 'elaborate' Russian defences as Putin condemns Israel's war

November 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Russian President Vladimir Putin reacted to criticism of his war in Ukraine from the world's wealthiest nations, now in its 91st week, by holding up Israel's war in Gaza for comparison.
"I understand that this war, and the death of people, cannot but shock," Putin told the virtual G20 meeting called by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday [November 21].
"And the extermination of the civilian population in Palestine in the Gaza Strip today, is not shocking?" Putin asked.
  the deaths of more than 14,500 civilians in Gaza to cast its own aggression in Ukraine in a more favourable light.
[Al Jazeera]
Putin's remarks came after a series of speeches from other leaders expressing shock at Russian aggression.
"Yes, of course, military actions are always a tragedy," Putin said. "And of course, we should think about how to stop this tragedy."
Some observers took this remark to be conciliatory, and Putin reminded his colleagues that 'Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine,' whereas Ukraine refuses peace talks with Russia under the current government.
But only the previous day his ambassador at large, Rodion Miroshnik, told reporters in Moscow that "the current regime [in Kyiv] is absolutely toxic, we do not see any options for co-existence with it at the moment."
Supermarket sticker protester imprisoned
Putin's opposition to war was also cast into doubt by domestic developments.
A St Petersburg court sentenced Russian artist Alexandra   to seven years' imprisonment for 'spreading false information' on November 17, after she replaced five supermarket price tags with messages against the war.
'The Russian army bombed an arts school in  . Some 400 people were hiding in it from the shelling,' one read. Another said, 'Russian conscripts are being sent to Ukraine. Lives of our children are the price of this war.'
A Russian wartime law criminalises criticism of Putin's prosecution of the invasion, and any view that deviates from the Kremlin's position.
Skochilenko wept in the dock as her sentence was read out. The prosecutor had asked for eight years.
'How weak is our prosecutor's faith in our state and society if he thinks our statehood and public safety can be ruined by five little pieces of paper?' she said in court.
'Everyone sees and knows that you are not judging a terrorist. You're not trying an extremist. You're not even trying a political activist. You're judging a pacifist.'
The ground war
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said troops were still launching counteroffensive actions on the southern front in the 91st week of the war, but had gone on the defensive in the east.
He attributed the defensive posture to winter weather, rather than a series of attacks Russian troops have launched in Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Kupiansk and Mariivka in recent weeks.
"Difficult weather, difficult defence on the Lyman, Bakhmut, Donetsk and Avdiivka fronts. Offensive actions in the south," Zelenskyy said on Telegram on Wednesday.
Even in the south, however, a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began in June has failed to make territorial gains for the past few weeks.
[Al Jazeera]
There was one bright spot for Ukraine on the front lines.
Ukraine's general staff said on November 17 their marines had established a bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson, killing a battalion's worth of Russian soldiers – some 1,200 men – and destroying two dozen tanks and four dozen armoured vehicles.
The figures were possibly cumulative for the entire period of this bridgehead action, which started approximately a month ago, when a Russian reporter said Ukrainian reconnaissance units had reached the outskirts of Krynky, 20km (12.4 miles) east of Kherson City on the left bank.
Ukraine general staff said, 'One of the main goals of this work is to push the enemy as far as possible from the right bank in order to secure the civilian population from continuous Russian shelling.'
Russian artillery killed two civilians in a parking lot in Kherson City on Monday, Ukrainian authorities said.
Despite Russia's difficulty in reinforcing its thin defences on this far western corner of the front, Ukraine has had difficulty getting on.
The staff said Russian defences in the area were 'fairly elaborate'.
A Ukrainian soldier told the Wall Street Journal they consisted of 'elaborate dugouts that [Russian forces] constructed over months'.
The strength of these could weaken over winter, said the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, a think tank.
'Russian forces have not constructed extensive visible defensive fortifications … and appear to have opted for more discrete fortifications set further from the frontline,' the ISW wrote.
'The discrete fortifications located away from the frontline in Kherson Oblast will likely only be fully effective if they remain concealed, however. Fall and winter weather conditions may reveal some concealed positions as foliage and natural ground cover die.'
[Al Jazeera]
Russian sources provided contradictory accounts about this Ukrainian action.
Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu told the Russian Ministry of Defence Collegium on November 21, that 'all attempts of the Ukrainian armed forces to conduct an amphibious operation in the Kherson direction were unsuccessful,' while 'suffering colossal losses'.
But on the same day, a Russian military reporter contradicted the official version, saying Ukrainian forces gunned down an entire Russian assault group near Krynky.
'If the company craps itself and leaves the village, there is no point in reporting that it is 'ours'," wrote the reporter in a   against official reports that gloss over bad news.
The air war
Russia scored more success by intensifying its attacks on the softer target of Ukrainian energy infrastructure - a repeat of last winter's tactic.
Russia reportedly sent a total of 96 Iranian-designed Shahed drones into Ukrainian civilian territory during the week in attacks almost every night. Some of the attacks were accompanied by missiles.
The worst came on the night of November 17-18, when Ukraine said it downed 29 out of 38 drones. But the rest caused power outages in 400 towns and villages in the south and north of the country.
"Your accuracy, guys, is literally life for Ukraine," Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the air force, but warned: "The closer we are to winter, the more Russians will try to make the strikes more powerful."
Ukrainian authorities said among the drones they shot down on November 21 was an Iranian-built Mohajer-6. Unlike the Shahed, the Mohajer is not a kamikaze drone. It is designed for reconnaissance and attack, and can carry four missiles.
The recurrence of Russia's winter tactics was likely the motive for Berlin upping the number of IRIS-T air defence systems it promised to supply Ukraine from eight to 12, in a new $1.3bn defence aid package on November 21. But the systems still have to be built, and capacity is low - only three of the eight previously pledged systems have been delivered, and those took a year.
The Finnish border
Separately, a border crisis brewed.
  said it was preparing to shut all but one of its eight border crossings with Russia on November 22.
Four were shut on November 17 after a surge of refugee arrivals – more than 600 in November, compared with dozens a month before that.
'Russia is effectively instrumentalising people, not only letting people through to the Finnish border with invalid documents or missing documents, which has not been the case before, but also we have evidence that Russia is effectively bringing those people to the border and organizing transport as well,' foreign minister Elina Valtonen told Reuters on November 21.
She described it as part of Russia's 'hybrid warfare' against Finland.
'At the EU border with Finland, Russian border guards have been letting people through without Schengen visas or EU residence permits. People who are being misled. People who are being used by Russia,' EU commissioner for home affairs Ylva Johansson said on November 21.
In 2021, Russia's main ally Belarus attempted to instrumentalise refugees, bringing in thousands of Syrians and Iraqis by plane from Istanbul, Amman and elsewhere and ferrying them to the borders with Poland and Lithuania.

Can the next UN vote stop Israel's war on Gaza?

November 11th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Tense and difficult negotiations continue at the United Nations Security Council in an effort to break the deadlock crippling the world's most powerful decision-making authority – as death and despair rain down on Gaza.
Al Jazeera has learned that Malta's ambassador to the UN, Vanessa Frazier, has circulated a new resolution among the Council members for consideration and a potential vote, hoping to finally pass a resolution on the war on Gaza, after   over the past month.
Malta is one of 10 elected members of the Council and has been the penholder on children in armed conflict since 2022. This position gives Malta the opportunity to play a leading role in the UNSC's efforts to protect children in conflict zones. Diplomatic sources have told Al Jazeera that this new resolution is being drafted with a focus on children in the hopes that all 15 members of the UNSC can agree on protections for children in the ongoing conflict.
On Friday, Adele Khodr, UNICEF Middle East and North Africa regional director, said, 'Children's right to life and health is being denied.' The UN agency went on to warn that the lives of one million children in the besieged enclave are "hanging by a thread" as child health services almost collapse across the Gaza Strip.
There is renewed hope that the UNSC will finally respond to the war on Gaza, not only because there have been new attempts to find compromise language that will appeal to all its members, including the United States, but also because there has been a shift in the stance of the US itself. President Joe Biden called for a  to Israel's war for the first time on November 2.
The US says it is actively engaging with the elected members – Albania, Brazil, Ecuador, Gabon, Ghana, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, Switzerland and the UAE. This is significant because its veto power has been one of the reasons why several of the previous Council resolutions have failed since violence broke out on October 7.
But, as ever, in theCouncil, there is much wrangling over the exact language of the resolution. Russia and China have   a US resolution calling for a 'humanitarian pause', a phrase suggesting it would be conditional and time-limited. Most of the rest of the Council wants the resolution to include the word 'ceasefire'. The choice of a single word in the resolution – pause or ceasefire – has meant an impasse in the UN's top body, empowered with the maintenance of international peace and security.
With the Maltese resolution, sources told Al Jazeera, a key question that might come up for debate is the duration of the pauses in fighting. Humanitarian groups, and even US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have said the   are currently not enough to ease humanitarian suffering meaningfully. However, it is unclear whether the US will agree to pauses that last several days at a stretch.
Still, one thing has changed since the previous resolutions. The UN General Assembly – which represents all of the UN member states – has expressed its clear opinion, calling for a humanitarian truce that passed on October 27 with 120 votes out of the 193 members. Such a resolution is not binding but has moral weight as a temperature check of the world's mood.
Why has the UN failed to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza?
Previous UNSC draft resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza have failed. Two resolutions drafted by Russia did not get enough votes, with the US among the countries that voted against them. Even though a resolution proposed by Brazil received 12 votes out of the 15 member states, the US vetoed the draft. And, Russia and China vetoed a resolution drafted by the US.
While the five permanent members of the UNSC – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the US – have the power to veto any resolution that they do not like, it remains reasonably rare. The US and Russia are the two countries that have exercised their veto power the most in the past. In recent years, the US has mostly used its veto to protect its ally Israel.
This was not always the case. Prior to the 1970s, the US often allowed resolutions to pass that Israel did not like.
In 1956, it voted with other UNSC members to criticise Israel for a military operation in Gaza the previous year. Egypt controlled Gaza at the time.
Will Israel abide if a resolution passes?
More recently, on December 23, 2016, during the last days of the Barack Obama administration, the UNSC passed Resolution 2334.
This resolution reaffirmed that Israel's settlements in occupied Palestine, including East Jerusalem, 'had no legal validity, constituting a flagrant violation under international law'. It added that the settlements were a major obstacle to the vision of a two-state solution. There was considerable pressure from Israel and within the US for the Obama administration to veto it, but in the end they abstained. The resolution passed with 14 votes.
While the Council's resolution, which also called for immediate steps to prevent violence against civilians, is 'binding international law', it was ignored by Israel.
What happens if a country defies a UNSC resolution?
If the resolution is broken, the next step is for the Council to take punitive action. This would be done in a follow-up resolution, which addresses the breach and calls for action.
The UN has taken action in the past by sanctioning breaching countries. However, in recent years, there has been pushback from permanent members Russia and China, who are not keen on the UNSC adopting new sanctions.
Under the UN Charter, the Council can go even further and order the authorisation of an international force. A notable example of this was in 1991 when a US-led military alliance was created to reverse the invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
The problem lies in any potential follow-up resolution. There are virtually no circumstances under which the Biden administration would support a punitive resolution that would take forceful action against Israel.
Currently, there are backchannel efforts from the US administration to try and get Israel to restrain its military operations and stop killing civilians. But they are not working.
Israel does not currently seem at all concerned about accountability under international law. Israel and the US are not signatories to the Rome Statute that set up the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The court has made it clear that it does have jurisdiction regarding crimes committed in the Gaza conflict. Violations of UNSC resolutions and breaches of international humanitarian law, such as targeting hospitals and indiscriminate bombardment of civilians, could form part of a compelling case.
But even if the ICC takes action, there is no way that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would voluntarily surrender himself into custody in The Hague. The same way, we have not seen Russian President Vladimir Putin offer himself up to the ICC judges when an arrest warrant for war crimes was  by the ICC in March.
All this does not mean that circumstances will not change at some point. And if you breach international law, there is no statute of limitation on war crimes. The ICC and a separate International Independent Commission of Inquiry, set up by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021, are gathering evidence on the current conflict. This will remain on the record for the world to see.
What has the UN done so far?
If we go back into history, the UN has established peacekeeping forces to tackle issues involving Israel. This includes the UN Emergency Force (UNEF), which deployed international peacekeepers on the border between Egypt and Israel in 1956.
Two other missions are still operating, to this day. The UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) was established in 1974 after the agreed disengagement of the Israeli and Syrian forces in the Golan Heights. In 1978, the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was formed to confirm Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and to restore international peace and security.
These forces have a mandate to report any breaches, monitor the situation and provide a calming presence.
Yet, there are limits to what these forces can accomplish by way of establishing peace. There is currently no calm on the front line between Lebanon and Israel, known as the Blue Line, with the heaviest clashes for years between Hezbollah and Israeli forces. The Golan Heights situation has also been very tense for a long time, including during the Syrian war.
But all that only matters if the UNSC can first agree on a resolution. It is about to be tested again.

Uman, Ukraine - David Meinhart is confident he arrived in the safest place on Earth.
He is in Uman, a city in central Ukraine that annually hosts tens of thousands of Hasidic Jewish pilgrims for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.
This year some 32,000 arrived - even though the Russian-Ukrainian war rages 300km (120 miles) to the south, and cruise missiles have struck Uman several times, killing two dozen people, including five children.
The war did not scare them off because they believe in their Rabbi's help from beyond the grave - and remember their forefathers' millennia-long survival in communities that barely tolerated Jews and occasionally turned hostile to them.
Pilgrims chose to flock to the grave of Rabbi Nachman, the founder of the Breslav branch of Hasidism, who died here in 1810. A blessed new year will come to fruition if they celebrate its eve near Nachman's grave, they say.
'We are a people who have lived and survived persecution, wars and dangers for thousands of years,' Meinhart, 62, told Al Jazeera.

His family's past reflects this survival experience.His father moved to the United States from Germany before World War II and fought against the Nazis who killed his relatives during the Holocaust.
Meinhart was born in the US but moved to Jerusalem 40 years ago to join a Hasidic community and father nine children.
This year, he came to Uman with his sons – leaving his wife and daughters behind was his only concession to the possible dangers of war.
'I could have brought my wife and my children, but I opted not to,' he said.
Some female pilgrims, however, braved the Russian invasion. 'There's no fear,' said Rachel, a 25-year-old French Jew.
She is adamant the pilgrimage does change people's lives for the better, and they return to their rabbi's grave again and again.
'People wouldn't come back here if [positive] things didn't happen to them,' Rachel said, standing on Pushkin Street in central Uman, the epicentre of pilgrimage.

A city transformed
The pilgrims who usually spend between two days and a week here transform the sleepy, impoverished city of 80,000.
They throng the streets leading to Nachman's grave and pay hundreds of dollars for a single bed.Less affluent visitors pitch tents next to apartment buildings or garages.
Cafeterias and fast food joints along their way display signs in Hebrew and promise kosher food and drink, while Israeli authorities and charities provide refreshments free of charge.
The pilgrims sport white or black robes, curly or braided sidelocks and long beards, and their skullcaps or shiny fur hats contrast the casual attire of the Ukrainian locals.
On Saturday, the day when they abstain from anything unrelated to religion, they left empty coffee cups and plastic plates on the ground and tables.They loudly conversed and prayed in Hebrew and Yiddish, looking jubilant and breaking into cheerful chants.
Their self-confident strides occasionally made locals step aside with some whispering obscenities or anti-Semitic slurs.
'Our mentalities differ,' admitted Boris, 28, a burly Jewish-Ukrainian volunteer who knows Hebrew and helps Uman police and residents mediate conflicts with the pilgrims.
'It's hard for police without us because they don't speak Hebrew or English,' he said.

Most Uman residents welcome the Hasidim and the influx of cash they bring to Ukraine, one of Europe's poorest nations whose economy shrank by one-third because of the war.
'There are [negative] moments but they are compensated by a chance to earn money,' Aleks Melnik, who lives on Pushkin Street, told Al Jazeera.
He is far more unhappy about tough security measures in Uman,  , and the non-transparent ways authorities spend the obligatory $200 payments from each pilgrim.
Melnik, 42, said he has to show his identification card to police officers guarding the street, and cannot drive his car there unless he pays a $100 bribe.
But over the decades he has befriended many pilgrims and said Ukrainians can take lessons when it comes to devotion to faith or national defence.
'We can definitely learn from them,' he said, sitting on a bench less than 50 metres (164 feet) away from Nachman's grave.
The grave site looked like a beehive humming with the sound of prayers of hundreds of men shaking their heads and holding religious books or leaflets.

Overcoming anti-Semitism
Anti-Semitism used to be rampant in what is now Ukraine.
Its most celebrated writer Nikolay Gogol described the casual, totally unprovoked killing of Jewish adults and children by warlike Cossacks.
Nobel Prize-winning Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich was blacklisted in Ukraine in 2018 for mentioning some anti-Soviet nationalists who sided with Nazi Germans during World War II and participated in the mass killing of Jews.
Three hundred years ago, this anti-Semitism - along with the influence of Protestant Christianity that emphasised a mystical and personal connection to God -   among the world's largest population of Ashkenazim, or Eastern European Jews.
Hasidic communities are still centred around 'dynasties' of rabbis, and only Nachman's followers are known as 'dead Hasidim' because he never named a successor.
The lifestyle of Rabbi Nachman and his followers confined to the Pale of Settlement in the western part of the Russian Empire could not be more different from that of their rulers.
Nachman died in Uman of tuberculosis when he was only 38 – at a time when a local aristocrat completed a giant park with marble statues, artificial lakes, and grottoes for his wife, a former courtesan he bought for two million golden coins.
Nachman's teachings were quickly accepted by many Ashkenazim, and these days his followers include Jews of Middle Eastern   - some of whom were seen in Uman.
The city has seen its share of pogroms that forced millions of Jews to leave for the United States and, later, British-controlled Palestine.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some of his cabinet members hail from Jewish families, and his government has tried to rein in ultranationalists who occasionally espouse anti-Semitism.
On Friday night, the pilgrims held a collective prayer for peace in Ukraine, and some urged Zelenskyy to visit the grave so Nachman helps Kyiv win the war against the Russian invaders.
'Come here and beseech God and I assure you, as does Rabbi Nachman — victory will be yours,' one of the pilgrims reportedly  said.

'No running water': War-displaced Gaza families bathe, wash in polluted sea

Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip – Andaleeb al-Zaq is grateful for the sea and its salty breeze.
"It's such a welcome change of scenery from the chaos and dirtiness of the school we've been staying in," the 48-year-old said. "The children treat it like we're on a school trip."
For Andaleeb, though, the "trip" is a matter of survival.
Her family, a total of 16 members, was displaced from their home in the Shujaiya neighbourhood, east of Gaza City shortly after Israel began bombing the Gaza Strip on October 7.
They headed down south to the central governorate of Deir al-Balah, and made their way to Alif Elementary Boys' School, run by the United Nations refugee agency.
"All the classrooms were already full with other families, about 80 people per class, so we set up a tent on the school grounds," Andaleeb said. "There's 8,000 people taking shelter there."

The school is close to the Mediterranean Sea, and because of the complete  , it has become a standard practice for some of the families and their children to head there to swim, bathe and wash their clothes.
Israel imposed a total siege on the Gaza Strip more than a month ago, after the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israeli towns and army outposts that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Some aid has been allowed into the enclave through the Rafah crossing with Egypt in recent days, but Israel continues to bar the entry of fuel. Gaza's sole desalination plant is out of service due to the lack of fuel.
The coastal strip, which has already been under a 17-year blockade by Egypt and Israel, has been transformed into scenes of staggering destruction. More than 10,300 Palestinians have been killed, the majority of them being women and children. Basic infrastructure has also been targeted. At least 58 percent of all residential units in the strip have been damaged, or 212,000 homes. Without fuel and electricity,hospitals have been working on solar-powered generators.
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has recorded that between October 21 and November 1, just 26 trucks carrying   and sanitation supplies entered the Gaza Strip, noting that this is nowhere near enough to meet the essential needs for the survival of the 2.3 million-strong population.
"We have no water, no sanitation, no running sewage system," said Imm Mahmoud, who is staying at the same school. "With this lack of basic hygiene, neither the adults nor the children are comfortable."
The 52-year-old mother has been displaced for a month and said she has no choice but to wash her family's clothes in the sea.
But she knows that even the seawater is polluted.
"Children have been suffering from diarrhoea, coughs and colds from the pollution and swimming in the sea," she said. "But what do you expect them to do? They have to find a way to release their energy. Being cooped up in a school can lead to a lot of yelling and fights with their families."

'Environmental and health crisis'
Even before the current war, inadequate sanitation infrastructure and electricity shortages meant that untreated sewage water was dumped into the sea – between 100 to 108 million litres – and was responsible  for more than one-quarter of illnesses. It was the primary cause of child morbidity in the Gaza Strip.
According to the Norwegian Refugee Council , the total shutdown of wastewater treatment plants in October has led to the release of more than 130,000 cubic metres of untreated sewage into the Mediterranean Sea daily, posing a grave environmental hazard.
The three major   in the Gaza Strip are all controlled by Israel. Since October 8, the pipeline from Israel to northern Gaza has remained closed. In the south, Israel reconnected the water supply to Khan Younis on October 15 but turned off the supply two weeks later.
And in the central area of the Gaza Strip, Israeli authorities confirmed their intention to restart water supplies on October 29, but residents say that has not happened, and the water coming in taps is either highly chlorinated or salty.
Khalil al-Degran said there have been cases of lung infections and intestinal flu due to unsanitary water [Ashraf Amra/Al Jazeera]
Khalil al-Degran, a doctor and emergency supervisor at Deir al-Balah's al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, said there is "an environmental disaster and massive health crisis" brought upon by the swelling of the population in the central Gaza Strip due to displaced families who are staying in UNRWA schools.
"You have on average 70 people staying in one classroom in unsanitary conditions," he said. "As a result, there's a lot of   going around, such as lung infections and intestinal flu due to the overcrowding. The lack of electricity and clean water has only exacerbated this.
"Due to the lack of clean running water, some of the displaced people have resorted to using the sea as a place to wash their clothes or to bathe, risking their lives under the Israeli bombing," he said.
On Sunday, an Israeli air raid targeted a group of children who were on the beach west of Deir Al-Balah.
"Three of them were killed and seven were wounded as a result of the Israeli air attack," al-Degran said.
"This aggression needs to stop immediately, and the border crossings must be open," he added. "We don't have medical supplies to treat the sick people, let alone those who are wounded from Israeli attacks."

Foul-smelling and dirty conditions
Displaced families said they will continue to bathe in the sea, saying there is no other choice.
"The schools are disgusting and there is no running water," said Nasser Zayed, 60.
"I come down to the sea to bathe every other day, otherwise I'd be like an eternal student, spending all my time within the confines of a classroom," he added.
"The toilets in the school are foul-smelling," said 17-year-old Rima Zaqqout. "The school in general smells horrible because there are piles of trash everywhere."
Rima's family were displaced three times after their home in northern Gaza was destroyed. They stayed with an aunt, then their uncle, but both homes were also damaged in the Israeli bombardment.
Despite the dangers, the sea is a respite for Rima and her siblings, who go to the sea every day at noon.
"We take shampoo with us to bathe the children," she said. "Sometimes we also swim. We're living through extremely trying times."

Analysis: What does Israel's Gaza incursion propaganda video reveal?

October 26th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
On Thursday, October 26, Israel released footage of a nighttime incursion into Gaza Strip. The Israeli military accompanied the heavily edited video with a statement claiming that 'in preparation for the next stages of combat, the [Israeli military] operated in northern Gaza. [Israeli army] tanks & infantry struck numerous terrorist cells, infrastructure and anti-tank missile launch posts. The soldiers have since exited the area and returned to Israeli territory.'
The video is obviously intended as propaganda, to send a message both to Israeli society and to the outside world.
It attempts to tell Israel and the Israelis 'we are not just sitting and waiting, we are doing something'. That is very important, as the Israeli military tries to counter doubts and uncertainties among the country's population about   a full-fledged ground invasion of Gaza yet — despite saying it will go in soon — almost three weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel.
Rather than openly confirm or deny hints that the civilian leadership and the military command may not exactly be seeing eye to eye, the Israeli military counters the doubts by the video. The Israeli army hopes that it will be read as 'our military is preparing, doing something, trying and testing in real conditions'. If that message is well received and accepted, as Israeli propaganda masters intended, it would ease internal tensions. No citizen – no society – wants to be in a position where he or she asks whether their leadership is lying to them or concealing something?
Unlike in most other countries, majority of Israelis serve in the armed forces and undergo regular refresher training where they are introduced to the latest tactics and technologies.
They are well prepared to judge military matters themselves. Most will immediately recognise that the force filmed consists of a tank company, with 12-15 formidable Merkava tanks, reinforced by armoured bulldozers and supported by long-range artillery from the rear. There are just glimpses of heavy armoured personnel carriers, but it is to be assumed that they would carry a company of infantry. Forces on the ground are assisted and monitored by aerial assets, from drones filming the action to successive layers of unmanned aerial vehicles, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that are not shown but are certainly deployed.
Israelis will see the video as well produced and timely. It surely eases tension and doubt, and tells them that their military forces can go in, and out, at will.
Palestinian fighters in Gaza, and the rest of the world are looking at it with different eyes and for different reasons. Hamas armed wing is undoubtedly reading into the release from a tactical point of view, to judge what it can expect from its enemy and prepare for it.
While I cannot rule out the possibility that the video is a total deception, intended to mislead the enemy into believing that Israel will attack in a way different from the one it demonstrates in its own propaganda, I believe that, at this stage, of preparations that would be too far-fetched. It would be confusing for units to fight in one way for the cameras and then radically change operational methods in a matter of days for the real battle.
Despite its primary intention to convey a targeted message, it reveals much more – possibly even what the Israeli military never intended to divulge at this stage.
Firstly, it confirms   almost a week ago: Israelis will breech their own concrete barriers using the ubiquitous armed bulldozers that will lead the armoured column through the gap. The video shows one bulldozer digging up the mines with its powerful shovel, the second sweeping them to the sides, widening the advance lane, allowing the follow-on vehicles to bypass any tank or armoured personnel carrier that is unable to advance. A recovery tank is, expectedly, included in the force, to tow back any armour incapacitated either by landmines or Hamas ground teams, rockets from multiple launchers or anti-tank missiles.
The most revealing details from the video concern the tactics of deployment of tanks and accompanying infantry. Usually, tanks in contact with the enemy extend and advance in parallel over a wide front, with tanks side-by-side, spaced 20-50 metres (66-164 feet) apart.
They are accompanied and closely followed by dismounted infantry whose task is to deal with hidden opposing forces. Defenders who have had plenty of time to prepare could be lying in wait to hit the advancing armour from the close range of 100 metres (328 feet) or less. Only dismounted infantry offers a field of vision over a wide front to engage such opposition quickly and efficiently.
But the Israeli military forces are shown advancing in a line — a riskier way to approach determined defences. When tanks, and accompanying infantry, are spread wide, defenders have to cover very wide angles to re-aim from one target to another. The attacker has the advantage that several tanks can concentrate fire on any point in front of them. An attacker advancing in a column can engage enemy bunkers straight ahead of it with one gun only. If it is taken out of action the next in line must bypass it, risking uncleared minefields or non-discovered resistance points.
The video also shows infantry staying inside armoured vehicles during the advance. So, the Israeli military does not think it would encounter significant resistance in the first two to three kilometres (1.2-1.9 miles) of open desert and fields. A clear sign that Israel expects significant resistance only when forces reach the first buildings at the outskirts of Gaza City.
Finally, the video suggests that the units will be commanded from the ground, at battalion level, covering the three or four companies involved in each line of advance. It also confirms that Israeli commanders will have a clear tactical overview of the battlefield from numerous drones like the one that filmed the video. Higher commands might only monitor and coordinate but crucial real-time decisions on the ground will be made by experienced operational lieutenant colonels.
The video does not help answer the biggest question: Will there be a ground offensive? But the world — and Hamas, no doubt — will have taken note.

Egypt faces scrutiny in US after Senator Menendez's bribery indictment

October 4th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - The corruption charges against top United States Senator   could have been dreamt up by a Hollywood writer: They involve gold bars, envelopes stuffed with cash and a luxury car.
However, for many of Menendez's colleagues in Congress, as well as rights advocates, the case is far more consequential than its movie-like intrigue.
Menendez is accused of accepting bribes in exchange for using his elected position to benefit the Egyptian government. But the allegations raise questions about the broader ties between the US and Egypt — a relationship that has been under scrutiny amid human rights concerns.
"This is not just an issue of one corrupt person. It is an issue of a problematic relationship that is not founded on the ideals and values of respect to democracy and human rights," said Nancy Okail, president of the Center for International Policy, a US-based think tank.
Rights groups have accused   government, which came to power in a 2013 military coup, of jailing tens of thousands of dissidents and outlawing virtually all political opposition.
El-Sisi's administration has denied accusations of rights abuses while stressing the need to maintain stability in the country. But in Washington, calls for rethinking ties with Cairo have been growing — especially after last month's indictment.
"This should spark a long overdue reassessment of the bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt," Okail told Al Jazeera.
Menendez has   to the charges.
The charges
Formerly, in his role as the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,   massive influence over US foreign policy. He stepped down from the role on September 22, the day the indictment  against him was released.
Federal prosecutors allege that Menendez and his wife illegally accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from three businessmen in return for using his 'official position to protect and enrich them and to benefit the Government of Egypt'.
According to the indictment, Menendez met with Egyptian officials and promised to facilitate arms sales to Cairo. He also provided associates with "highly sensitive" information — including details about US Embassy personnel in Cairo — which was then relayed to Egyptian officials.
Mai El-Sadany, executive director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy (TIMEP), a Washington, DC-based think tank, said the allegations are "extremely serious" and unprecedented.
"They indicate collusion with Egyptian military and security officials. They indicate interference on the part of Egyptian officials into policymaking. And they indicate that Egypt was using illegal tactics to influence our foreign policy," El-Sadany told Al Jazeera.
Still, the response from the administration of US   has been muted. Officials have mostly refused  to weigh in on the allegations against Menendez, citing the ongoing status of the legal proceedings.
Asked about the issue last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would not comment on an "active" legal matter.
"The administration should be furious at the Egyptian regime," said Seth Binder, director of advocacy at the Project on Middle East Democracy (POMED), a rights group. "This is supposed to be a strategic partner, a close partner of the United States."
Binder added that the Biden administration could sanction Egyptian officials involved in the case, restrict military aid to Cairo or impose penalties for broader human rights abuses in Egypt.
But for now, there is no sign of that happening. In Congress, though, many Democrats are demanding more scrutiny of Washington's partnership with Cairo.
Sen. Menendez should resign and there should be a full policy review of our relationship (including security assistance) with Egypt and investigation into potential foreign influence campaign.
- Rep. Jason Crow (@RepJasonCrow) September 26, 2023
Don Beyer, a Democratic congressman, called on the US to "note and respond forcefully to the covert Egyptian campaign to thwart American foreign policy aims detailed in the indictment".
For his part, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy also said that the Foreign Relations Committee has a "responsibility" to understand what happened — and the extent to which Egypt was involved.
'There are serious implications for US policy towards Egypt if — as the indictment suggests — they were trying to use illicit means to curry favour on the committee,' he told reporters last month.
'Hold' on aid
On Saturday, statements turned into action as Senator Ben Cardin, who replaced Menendez as committee chair, placed a "hold" on $235m in aid to Egypt.
Cardin cited Egypt's human rights record in a statement  . But his move underscored the power his predecessor had over Washington policy in relation to Cairo.
"Congress has been clear, through the law, that the government of Egypt's record on a range of critical   issues, good governance, and the rule of law must improve if our bilateral relationship is to be sustained," Cardin said in a statement .
"Therefore, I will not allow foreign military financing currently under consideration to move forward."
He also pledged to block future aid and arms sales to Egypt if its government "does not take meaningful and sustainable steps to improve the human rights conditions in its country".
Earlier this year, US lawmakers had placed human rights conditions on $320m of the $1.3bn that Cairo receives annually from Washington.
But Blinken waived the conditions last month on the grounds that the assistance advances US interests, like "counterterrorism" efforts and stability in the Middle East.
The US ultimately   to Egypt. In previous years, the Biden administration also   conditions lawmakers placed on other parts of the assistance to Egypt.
Binder said the Menendez case played a role in the recent decision to freeze the $235m in aid. He noted that Senator Cardin would not have become the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee were it not for the indictment. "It certainly was a factor," he told Al Jazeera.
It is unclear what will happen to the suspended funds now.
"We are continuing to consult closely with Congress and the Egyptian government on providing the foreign military financing package announced by the Secretary that advances our shared vision for a secure and prosperous region while ensuring tangible progress on human rights in Egypt," a State Department spokesperson told Al Jazeera in an email.
The Egyptian embassy in Washington did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment by the time of publication.
'Status quo thinking'
Biden came into office in 2021, promising to centre human rights in US foreign policy. In fact, as a candidate in 2020, he specifically slammed his predecessor Donald Trump for maintaining close ties with President el-Sisi.
'No more blank checks for Trump's 'favorite dictator',' he wrote in a social media post at that time, referring to the Egyptian president.
Mohamed Amashah is finally home after 486 days in Egyptian prison for holding a protest sign. Arresting, torturing, and exiling activists like Sarah Hegazy and Mohamed Soltan or threatening their families is unacceptable. No more blank checks for Trump's favorite dictator. https://t.co/RtZkbGh6ik
- Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 12, 2020
Observers say rights violations in Egypt have continued in recent years, and some advocacy groups fear the abuses may intensify ahead of a   at the end of the year.
But since taking office, Biden has bolstered the alliance with Egypt, inaugurating a formal joint strategic dialogue and economic commission with the country.
Moreover, US officials often laud Egypt and   in mediating ceasefires between Israel and Palestinian groups in Gaza.
El-Sadany, of TIMPE, blamed what she called "status quo thinking" in the US foreign policy establishment for Washington's apparent unwillingness to adjust its posture towards Cairo.
"There is an incorrect assumption that if we shake the relationship with Egypt, and Egypt doesn't receive the aid in full, that it will somehow upset the relationship with Israel," she told Al Jazeera.
"But the reality is that Egypt acts in its own interests and that actually, this Egyptian regime is quite close to Israel, with the US aid or without it."

Chris Christie: The former New Jersey governor and federal prosecutor is a vocal critic of former President Donald Trump.  , 61, is against abortion rights and has supported US aid to Ukraine and Israel. He advised Trump's White House campaign but became a vocal critic of the former president after the January 6, 2021, US Capitol rioting. He stepped up his verbal attacks as Trump faced a growing number of criminal charges. Christie has received about 2 percent support among Republicans in a Reuters/Ipsos conducted from September 8 to 14.
Ron DeSantis: The Florida governor has positioned himself to the right of Trump on many key social issues such as abortion. But his well-funded campaign has struggled to gain traction, and his top donor has said he won't give DeSantis more money   a more moderate approach. The 45-year-old is Trump's top rival but remains nearly 40 percentage points behind in opinion polls. He has fired staff and rebooted his campaign several times since his glitch-filled campaign launch in May, but those steps have done little to boost his candidacy. His campaign says it is focused on stopping Trump in Iowa, where the party will hold its first nominating contest in January. He got a much-needed boost on Monday when the Midwestern state's Republican Governor Kim Reynolds endorsed him. As governor, DeSantis has enacted several   on social issues, signing bills to limit discussions of gender and sexuality in schools, and to ban abortions. He has called the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory of West Bank 'disputed territory", a view that contradicts international United Nations resolutions.
Nikki Haley: The 51-year-old has   in the Republican Party as a solid conservative who has the ability to address issues of gender and race more credibly than many of her peers. She has also pitched herself as a stalwart defender of US interests abroad. She has low single-digit support among Republicans, according to opinion polls. A former South Carolina governor and Trump's ambassador to the UN, Haley has emphasised her relative youth compared with Biden and Trump, as well as her background as the daughter of Indian immigrants. She has historically praised and defended Israel.
Vivek Ramaswamy: A former biotechnology investor and executive,  , 38, started a company in 2022 to pressure firms to abandon environmental, social, and corporate governance initiatives. Running on a pro-fossil fuel platform, Ramaswamy says he wants toeliminate the Department of Education and the  , the US tax agency, and shut down the FBI. After receiving criticism for saying the US should not provide military aid to Israel, Ramaswamy clarified that he would provide "the most pro-Israel vision". The political outsider has stoked grassroots chatter as a potential alternative to Trump. He is a fervent supporter of the former president and says if he won the White House, he would pardon Trump.
Tim Scott: The 58-year-old   for South Carolina since 2013. The only Black Republican senator has low name recognition outside his home state, but his optimism and focus on unifying his divided party have helped him draw a contrast with a more aggressive approach from Trump and DeSantis. Scott's supporters, however, acknowledge that while his sunny demeanour is a selling point, it may not be enough to win. He attracted 2 percent support among Republicans, according to Reuters/Ipsos September polling. Scott has criticised Biden's policies on immigration, student loan forgiveness, and US competition with China. He is pro-Israel and recently posted on X that Hamas aims to eliminate Jews everywhere, including the US.
Let's not forget that Hamas' objective isn't simply the elimination of Israel.
It's the elimination of Jews everywhere — including America.
So if we don't stand with Israel now, who will stand with us later?
- Tim Scott (@votetimscott) November 3, 2023
Participating candidates must secure 4 percent of the vote in either two national polls, or 4 percent of the vote in one national poll alongside 4 percent of the vote in polls in two different early-primary states to earn a spot on the stage. Additionally, they require 70,000 unique donors to qualify, the Republican National Committee has said.
The qualification period runs until Wednesday.
What about the remaining candidates?
Mike Pence: On October 28, the former vice president announced that he was dropping out of the Republican presidential nomination race.
Doug Burgum: The 67-year-old, who sold his software business to Microsoft in 2001, is serving his second four-year term as North Dakota's governor. A proponent of low taxes and fewer regulations, he has sought to portray himself as a traditional conservative with a focus on the economy and national security. One of the least-known contenders, he received 0 percent in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll. While qualifying for the first two debates, he failed to meet the criteria required for the third one.
Asa Hutchinson: The former Arkansas governor launched his bid for the White House in April with a call for Trump to step aside to deal with the former president's first indictment. Hutchinson, 72, has touted his experience leading his deeply conservative state as proof he can deliver on policies Republican voters care about, citing tax cuts and job creation initiatives. Still, his name recognition remains limited outside Arkansas, and he received 0 percent support in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll. He qualified for the first Republican debate, but not the second or third one.
Will Trump be there?
Trump has declined his invitation to the third Republican date. To counterprogram the debate, he has scheduled a rally in Florida. He also skipped the first two Republican debates.
What is the significance of this debate?
The third debate might be one of the last opportunities for Trump's opponents to make a dent in his popularity among primary voters. The first two debates did not make a big difference to Trump's lead, who continues to lead national polls by a large margin of approximately 40 percent.
DeSantis and Haley are locked in a fierce competition for second place. While DeSantis leads Haley nationally, the latter is ahead in New Hampshire and South Carolina, two crucial states in the Republican nominating process.
The third debate marks the first time a Jewish group is cosponsoring a national debate in the US. The Republican Jewish Coalition's decision to sponsor the debate was due to the importance of US foreign policy amid the Israel-Gaza conflict.
What to know about the moderators?
Lester Holt is a broadcast journalist and the anchor for NBC Nightly News. He co-moderated the first Democratic presidential primary debate in 2020.
Kristen Welker hosts NBC's Meet the Press. Welker was   for how she navigated moderating the presidential debate between the incumbent, Joe Biden, and his predecessor, Trump.
Hugh Hewitt is a conservative radio show and podcast host, as well as a columnist for The Washington Post.
Republican politicians and voters have been critical of this cohort of moderators, deeming them too anti-Republican.
It makes sense to have @hughhewitt  host a debate among Republican presidential candidates. It's INSANE to have Lester Holt and Kristen Welker anywhere near the action. We know who they are—they've made that clear—and they hate the GOP.
Who did this? https://t.co/lrTaPAyP0M
- Mike Lee (@BasedMikeLee) October 27, 2023
What happened during the last debate?
During the   Republican debate, DeSantis criticised Trump for his absence, and Christie chimed in by accusing the former president of being afraid. Pence criticised Trump for wanting to centralise power in the federal government and Haley said the former president was focusing on trade rather than security in his approach to China.
The candidates made their conservative stances on immigration clear during the last debate. Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, called to end foreign aid to Latin America until the border was secured and Ramaswamy, also the son of Indian immigrants, proposed to revoke US citizenship for children born in the country to parents in the US illegally.
Ramaswamy defended joining the  , which he said he uses to connect with young voters. 'Every time I hear you, I feel a little dumber,' Haley responded to this.
'Joe Biden doesn't belong on the picket line,' Pence joked. 'He belongs on the unemployment line.'

Escape from al-Shifa: How a Gaza medic dodged Israeli patrols, snipers

November 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip – Jawdat Sami al-Madhoun could hardly believe it when he saw the gates of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital appear in front of him. The 26-year-old doctor's assistant had managed to leave the besieged al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City and walk the 16km (10 miles) to Deir el-Balah.
Jawdat had spent the previous 25 days volunteering at al-Shifa's emergency department, struggling along with the rest of its staff to help the injured as best they could, often without the most basic medicines and supplies.
'We couldn't help the wounded,' he told Al Jazeera on Monday, looking away as his voice broke. 'They were dying! We couldn't do anything to save them. We would just watch them die.
'There are hundreds of bodies in the hospital's courtyard. We couldn't even bury them.'
A hospital where nobody can help the sick
Al-Shifa has been besieged by Israeli forces since Friday, with nobody allowed in or out of the compound of Gaza's oldest and largest hospital. On Wednesday, Israeli forces raided it, claiming that there was a Hamas fighters' command centre within. That claim has not been proven to date.
The hospital lost its electricity supply entirely on Saturday, bringing all its medical devices to a stop and endangering   whose incubators stopped working.
Since then, seven babies have died, a toll that is rising as the hospital remains offline. Staff at the hospital have interred at least   in the courtyard.

Even moving between the medical buildings on the compound, Jawdat said, was a matter of life and death because Israeli snipers targeted anyone moving.
"I was a volunteer," he said. "I would receive people, triage some cases, and bandage up anyone I could help. I'm not a fully trained nurse, but I studied it for about a year and a half, so I wanted to do something, anything, to help.
"One day, four beautiful little girls came in, the oldest was about 13 years old, only one of them was injured… they came in with their dead family, father, mother, brother, we did what we had to do and buried them," Jawdat stopped again, lowering his head and sobbing.
"The injured little girl looked at me and said: 'Please, Uncle, let me die with them. I don't know how I would live without my parents and my brother.'
"Another day, we received a 12-year-old boy, badly injured in an attack that had killed his family. Whenever he saw me, he would say: 'Can you either make me better or let me go [die] with them?'
"I don't know where we got the energy to do this work. God must have given all of us the strength to keep going. The doctors were working in a frenzy. They were willing to work for three, four days in a row without sleeping, to do anything if they could just save one more child, one more person.
At times, Jawdat had to stop recounting the horrors he had seen to simply cry [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]
"I have a friend, Islam al-Munshid; I was surprised to find him in the reception area one day, badly injured. Turns out he had been hurt in the Israeli attack on al-Shifa gate the day before, and I hadn't seen him in the middle of all the injuries that were coming in. I asked the doctors how he was doing, and they said: 'He's brain dead, but his body is still breathing. Pray for him to rest in peace.'
"Three days, 72 hours, I would go and check on him every hour to see if he was still breathing or not until finally, he died.
"There was nothing we could do. If we had the least bit of equipment, maybe we could have helped him, but we had nothing, so we could do nothing. His skull was broken in two places, and he would have needed urgent surgery to save his life, but we couldn't."
A family separated
Jawdat and his wife, May, like many families in Gaza, had decided to stay in separate locations in the hopes that as many people as possible would survive the relentless Israeli bombing and could reunite later.
May, 23, was also in Gaza City, but Jawdat was unable to reach her because of tanks, snipers and random explosions on the streets.
Jawdat had to work hard to convince his mother to flee her home for her own safety [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]
Talking about May, Jawdat's fear got the better of him, and he broke down in tears again at the thought that he may never see his wife again.
He knew that there was no way he could have reached her in Gaza City, but the fact that she had only received one of his messages in several days and he had heard nothing from her for three days overwhelmed him.
Desperate to be with his family, his mind turned to Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, where he had finally managed to convince his mother to move on Friday.
"My mother has kidney ailments, but she was adamant that she would never leave her city. She would tell me: 'If we, the people of this land, leave it, who will be left to take care of it?'
"But her continued presence there was such a danger to her life and her."
Without his family, he felt lost, and at al-Shifa, he felt helpless.
'We couldn't do much for the wounded. There's no gauze, no oxygen, no supplies. All we could do was clean their wounds. Some of those who died, all they needed was a little oxygen.'
The only respite, he said, was when the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was able to help them move the premature babies, all bundled up tightly to keep them as warm as possible without their incubators.

'The ICRC [got] us one hour to move the premature babies from the maternity ward to the reception hall,' Jawdat said.
'They also told us to stay away from the windows lest we get shot. We were, of course, so very 'grateful' to them for that warning,' he said wryly.
'A little bit of courage'
Jawdat left the hospital with a group of displaced people who had been sheltering at al-Shifa, hoping to make it past Israeli soldiers, tanks and snipers all the way to the south.
He knew the risks.
'[Monday] morning, we received six cases in the hospital, all injuries. They had gotten shot after the Israeli army told them it was OK to leave the building they were in. As they left, they promptly got shot,' Jawdat said.
But he had heard that a previous group that left earlier in the day had made it through safely.
'They said they were shot at, but they made it south. A little bit of courage, they said. It takes a little bit of courage.'
Jawdat and his companions were shot at three times, running on each occasion to try to avoid the snipers. Eventually, the group split up as the slower people lagged behind, and others split off at various intersections.

At one point, Jawdat and a few others were stopped by Israeli soldiers, who made them stand with their hands up in the air, holding their IDs. One man scratched his head, Jawdat said, and was called over by the Israeli soldiers. He is not sure what happened to him after that.
At another point, 'they took about 20 men and stripped them naked, beat them, humiliated them, then released them. It's like whenever the soldiers get bored, they would pick one to bully and humiliate'.
That was not the worst of what Jawdat saw on the road. He said he ran past bodies, a little girl's severed foot and a woman in her 50s, still wearing her prayer clothes, lying dead on the ground.
Jawdat made it to Deir el-Balah. He doesn't know how many more of those who also fled al-Shifa did.

Where do Morocco and Sudan relations stand with Israel?

September 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Three years after the Arab Gulf countries of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates grabbed headlines for becoming the third and fourth Arab countries to   with Israel, the two North African countries that followed suit are not quite as far along in terms of relations.
In October and December 2020, Sudan and Morocco respectively announced that they had agreed to normalise with Israel.
General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the leader of the civilian-military transitional Sovereign Council in Sudan, had   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February 2020.
Al-Burhan, buoyed by the United States signalling it was ready to consider removing Sudan from its list of State Sponsors of Terrorism in return, said he undertook this step with the 'supreme interest' of the Sudanese people at heart.
But, while diplomatic relations between Morocco and Israel blossomed into full cooperation in various sectors, Khartoum's agreement with Israel remained nominal due to the outbreak of civil war between rival generals in April.

According to Kholood Khair, a Sudanese political analyst,the Abraham Accords was a way for Sudan's transitional government to 'try and mend bridges between itself and the Americans after the fall of [former dictator] Omar al-Bashir, and also with itself and the Emiratis who are very anti-Muslim Brotherhood,' she said.
Al-Bashir, who ruled Sudan for 30 years until he was overthrown by a military coup in 2019, had maintained a military-political Islamist coalition as the foundation of his National Congress Party.
Khair said the agreement did not have any 'civilian dividends' as 'the military was far more interested in some of the spyware, surveillance, etc that Israel had".
"The Israelis didn't trust the Sudanese enough to give them that equipment but all of the other things that could have been on the table – agricultural cooperation, technology, etc – were not,' she explained.
Rabat and Israel's close collaboration
Morocco's relations with Israel stand in stark contrast as the two have deepened their intelligence cooperation, arms and technology trade, and engaged in joint military drills.
Riccardo Fabiani, North Africa project director at the Crisis Group, said the relationship between Rabat and Israel has reached a   than normalisation.
'Israel and Morocco do not simply enjoy a fully normal diplomatic relationship, but they have laid the foundations for a full-blown political, economic and, most importantly, military cooperation,' he told Al Jazeera.
'From Israeli investment to sales of advanced equipment and weapons to Rabat, the two countries are collaborating very closely.'
Last July, Israel also recognised Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara, reportedly a   for Rabat to open its embassy in Tel Aviv.

Fabiani said this recognition has green-lit the selling of Israeli advanced military equipment and weapons to Morocco.
'From Israel's perspective, Morocco is now a close partner in North Africa, and Moroccan narratives that they face the same enemies – Rabat claims that the Polisario Front is backed by Iran – have helped cement this relationship,' he explained.
'Selling weapons and equipment is a way for Israel to get new 'friends' in the region and expand its influence, regardless of the impact it has on local tensions.'
Pro-Palestinian civil groups in Morocco, as well as other left-wing activists, have objected to the new rapport between the two countries, but many fear political reprisal if they speak out.
'The linkage between normalisation and Western Sahara has made it difficult for many Moroccans to openly oppose this development, as Western Sahara is a sacred national political cause in Morocco,' Fabiani said.
'Many other Moroccans have been quiet or not explicitly opposed to normalisation, while other constituencies [some Amazigh activists, for example] have publicly welcomed and supported this step, as they see it as a way of putting a distance between Morocco and pan-Arabism and strengthening pluralism in the country through the recovery of Morocco's Jewish identity.'
Three Noes to three Yeses?
In Sudan, civil society's reaction to normalisation was ignored as it was not a priority for them, Sudan affairs analyst El-Waleed Mousa said.
'They had more pressing issues, such as drafting the constitution and disentangling military officers from the political and executive affairs,' he said, referring to the Sovereign Council body.
The signing of the accords was done in a "clandestine manner" and the Sudanese generals, Mousa said, "didn't have the courage to rationalise their plan by communicating it with the public".
Khartoum is long remembered by Israelis as the city where the Arab League in 1967 proclaimed its "Three Noes" resolution on Israel – no recognition, no peace and no negotiations.
Speaking at a meeting with al-Burhan in February this year, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen – as part of the only foreign delegation sent to Sudan post-coup – said he is building a 'new reality' with Sudan, turning the three noes into three yeses.
"Yes to negotiations between Israel and Sudan, yes to recognition of Israel and yes to peace between the states and between the peoples,' Cohen said.
Analyst Khair said the usual actors against normalisation would be the Islamist supporters of al-Bashir. But it was under al-Bashir – not under al-Burhan – that normalisation was first brought up.
'It was in 2016 – when the Bashir regime turned away from Iran [to be] closer to Saudi Arabia and US allies – that the issue of normalisation had come up,' she said.
'The then-head of the Congress party, Ibrahim Ghandour, had been publicly saying that maybe normalisation with Israel would be a good way for the regime to go as they were trying to court different allies.'
'The way the generals had tried to sell it was to say that this is a way for us to come back into the global fold after so many years of being a pariah state,' she added.

While the nominal agreement signed under then-US President Donald Trump represents more of a security act rather than a warm peace, the future of Israeli-Sudanese relations is up in the air.
'The Abraham Accords with Sudan basically rested on military engagement,' Khair said. 'Israel worked mostly with the generals who are now at war, and for whom a future political position is very unlikely if things go well in terms of the negotiations taking place.'
If the country had a civilian government, she went on to say, keeping the Abraham Accords might be seen as a net value, especially with presenting to the US and the UAE that the era of political Islam in Sudan is over.
And, while it may be premature to consider given the ongoing war, Khair said the nature of the accords will shift.
'There will need to be more areas of civilian-to-civilian cooperation in areas of agriculture, technology, potentially health as well,' she said.
'There will probably be a rejigging of how the accords move forward.'

The health ministry in Gaza said more than 50 people were killed and scores of others wounded in the Israeli bombardment.
"More than 50 martyrs and around 150 wounded and dozens under the rubble, in a heinous Israeli massacre that targeted a large area of homes in Jabalia camp in the northern (Gaza) Strip," a health ministry statement said.
There was no immediate comment from Israel.

November 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Israeli cabinet has agreed to a temporary ceasefire deal that will enable the release of about 50 people who have been held captive in Gaza since the Hamas armed group stormed southern Israel on October 7.
The agreement came after talks on the   that continued into the early hours of Wednesday morning, with Israeli media reporting heated exchanges between ministers of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
The prime minister's office said the government had agreed to a deal under which Hamas will release at least 50 women and children during a "pause in fighting" of about four to five days.
Israel is expected to release about 140 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in return.
The final agreement has not been made public but it is also thought to allow humanitarian aid to be sent into Gaza, which has been under intense Israeli bombardment since the Hamas attack. More than 14,100 people have been killed.
There are about 237 captives held in Gaza from Israel and several other countries.   are not thought to be included in the agreement.

Analysis: How would Israel find, map, take and keep Gaza's tunnels?

November 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A week after Israeli troops encircled Gaza City and cut it off from the southern part of the Gaza Strip, there seems to be no evidence of a serious attack towards the centre.
On Wednesday, a select group of Israel-based foreign reporters was taken to a section of the battlefield, which journalists described as 'the fringes of Gaza City'. Nearly every building was destroyed or heavily damaged by aerial bombardment, artillery fire or advancing tanks and infantry.
Videos show Merkava tanks grouped in an encampment surrounded by tall sandy berms, almost certainly constructed by the armoured combat bulldozers routinely deployed with advance units. The defensive sand walls are likely to deny Hamas fighters the opportunity for hit-and-run attacks.
To an analyst, the position and posture of that 401st Brigade company show more than the Israelis probably wanted to. It tells us the advance will be slow, street by street rather than block by block.
It also proves that Gaza City's hardest battle, the underground one, has not begun in earnest. Some tunnels may have been identified and destroyed as troops advanced, but that is likely a tiny part.
The 34 Israeli soldiers whom Israel has admitted have been killed so far were apparently killed individually or in small groups – when tunnel war begins, the numbers are likely to jump in bigger groups.
To enter the tunnels, Israeli forces will have to resort to military practices decades old and long forgotten to get around the challenges of fighting underground.
Identifying entrances
To gain a position to fight in the tunnels, Israel has to identify as many entrances as possible. For a system believed to be up to 500km (310 miles) long, those probably number in the tens of thousands.
Most are hidden, inside residential buildings, garages, industrial facilities, warehouses, under rubbish dumps and, after more than a month of bombardment, under heaps of rubble.
But Israel has been preparing to tackle the tunnels since the 2014 incursion into Gaza. Incessant surveillance by drones, using sophisticated software that analyses movement patterns and can recognise individual faces and match them to a database of known Hamas members, revealed hundreds or thousands of entrances.
Informants probably added more, and I would not be surprised if the Weasels (Samur) specialised Israeli tunnel-warfare unit, knows half the tunnel access points.
Mapping the tunnels
Knowing the entrances is useful, but even if all known ones were attacked, that would not make the tunnels unusable for Hamas. Most tunnels have several entrances at each end so some would always remain open.
The tunnel builders, Hamas, have a huge advantage as they know the network. Israeli software might offer hints connecting patterns of movement to reveal that two points are probably connected, but it does not reveal the underground routes, directions, or junctions.
To map the tunnels with whatever degree of accuracy, commandos must get inside, facing huge dangers and difficulties. The first is technical: Down there, GPS positioning devices are useless as satellite signals cannot penetrate the soil.
The solution will most probably use devices that combine magnetic sensors, not affected by going underground, and movement sensors like those used in step counters. A crude and imprecise system, but better than nothing.
Getting around
Once inside, the Weasels will most likely operate with night-vision goggles rather than give away their position using lights. They will not be able to use radios to communicate with units on the surface, so they will have to use field telephones, technology from over 100 years ago.
Soldiers will unroll wires, connecting them on the move, further slowing the advance. Even if they do not meet Hamas resistance, they must stop at every junction and assess where the branches lead.
A small force will have to be left at every side tunnel to defend from counterattacks. Every time they find a vertical shaft, which are almost always used for entrances, they will have to pause, map the position and relay it back to units on the surface.
Surface units will have to find the opening and secure it; if it is in territory not controlled by the Israeli army, they will either have to take it or tell the tunnellers to stop or go around it. This will repeat hundreds of times. In the past, Samur released videos of its tunnel-capable robots that might be useful as trailblazers, reconnoitring passageways and sending back night-vision videos. But they can be used on one level only, as they cannot climb ladders or obstacles.
Surviving inside
For practical purposes, everything has been analysed so far assuming that there is no opposition in the tunnels. That is completely unrealistic: Hamas has surely prepared to put up fierce resistance.
Most tunnels are probably booby-trapped with pre-positioned improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Those can be wired to remote detonators, but they can also be triggered by specialised detonators that react to light, vibration, noise, movement, and even increased carbon dioxide concentration when people are present.
The tunnels are laced with wires and cables that carry electricity, internet, telephones and military lines. Hamas may have observation and detection devices that would let them know where the Israelis are so they can remotely explode charges in that exact spot.
Israelis cannot simply cut all the wires because, like in movies, some detonators might be triggered when their electrical supply is severed. As everyone with a connection to mining knows, explosions in confined tunnels are far deadlier than on the surface. They spread further and suck out oxygen so those who survive the initial blast often suffocate.
Hamas may also ignite incendiary compounds that deprive occupants of oxygen and spread as high-speed flash fires or create thick, often toxic smoke. This would keep the tunnels mostly undamaged, allowing the Palestinian fighters to use them after they force the enemy out.
The Weasels will almost certainly have breathing apparatuses but wearing cumbersome masks and air tanks makes communication and combat more difficult.

Forcing Hamas out
Every commander, on both sides, prefers to avoid fighting in tunnels. Hamas probably cannot prevent Israelis from entering some tunnels but can try to deny them the freedom to operate in them.
Israeli command knows that its advantage in technology and weapons is considerably higher on the ground than under it, so it would prefer to flush Hamas out and fight on the surface. To do so, it may use chemical agents such as teargas, a little of which goes a long way in tight tunnels.
It is likely Hamas does not have enough protective gear for its tunnel fighters, so any gas-based agent could be effective. Even though Israel does not feel constrained by international conventions, as it does not regard Hamas as a legal combatant, I do not think it would use lethal gasses. That would cause additional international accusations that would be hard to deny.
Water has often been used in the past to flood tunnels and force their occupants out but there is simply not enough water in Gaza. But there may be other options. Egypt is said to have poured sewage into smuggling tunnels from Gaza.
Fighting
Urban fighting is difficult, requiring specific knowledge and equipment; tunnel combat is even more challenging and specialised. As military tunnellers found years ago, ordinary weapons are too big and cumbersome to use in confined spaces.
American Tunnel Rats in Vietnam often only used pistols but found that, when they fired, the flash destroyed their night sight for a long time. When using night vision goggles the problem is even worse, so it is likely that Israelis will carry smaller calibre weapons with sound suppressors, not so much to decrease noise as to prevent muzzle flashes.
Whatever firearms they choose, tunnel fighters will have limited firepower as only two can fire at a time, one kneeling, the other standing over them, blocking the field of fire for the rest of the team.
Hand and rifle grenades are almost certainly out, as well as any kind of rocket launchers. Stun and flash grenades might give the Weasels an advantage by rendering the enemy temporarily deaf and blind, but it is questionable if those can be used without danger to their own side.
In line with centuries-old practice, they will certainly be equipped with combat knives or machetes, as hand-to-hand fighting is certain to happen. There has been much talk about Israeli tunnelling attack dogs, but a military and police canine expert I talked to dismisses the idea.
Dogs are far too unpredictable in conditions of extreme combat stress and there were many cases when under flashes and noise of a firefight they turned against their own side, he explained.

Destroying tunnels
Hamas needs the tunnels and might only want to block some of them tactically but not destroy them altogether using small explosions to prevent the enemy from using a particular tunnel.
Digging under combat conditions is impractical and makes the diggers vulnerable the moment the obstacle is removed, so a blocked tunnel is likely to remain so for the duration of conflict. Israeli combat engineers had announced that they were testing a 'sponge bomb', a device containing two chemical substances that create rapidly expanding foam.
The idea is to instantly create a concrete-hard plug to block the tunnels, but there were mishaps in use, and it is not certain if the sponge bomb is ready for deployment. Rather than just block it, Israel wants to destroy every tunnel it takes, so it will have to make sure that the entire structures are caved in, not just the entrances.
In most cases, this cannot be done by simply placing explosives inside tunnels. For more permanent demolition, it is usually necessary to dig deep holes in tunnel walls and ceilings, fill them with blasting dynamite and detonate so that deep structure is shaken and soil caves in to fill it.
It looks quite implausible to embark on such a massive engineering undertaking during fighting, so Israel might see its task as first destroying Hamas fighters and then demolishing their entire underground network.
To get to the latter part might take Israel months and it must win the underground war first, something that will also take time.

November 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
South Africa's Parliament has voted in favour of a motion calling for the closure of Israel's embassy in Pretoria amid soaring tensions between the two countries over the Israeli assault on Gaza.
The motion is largely symbolic as it will be will be up to President Cyril Ramaphosa's government whether to implement it.
The motion calling for the closure of the embassy passed on Tuesday with 248 votes in favour and 91 votes against.
The motion introduced by the leftwing opposition party Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was backed by the ruling African National Congress and opposed by members of the centrist, white-majority Democratic Alliance (DA) which is largely pro-Israel.
Ramaphosa has previously said his country believes Israel is committing war crimes and genocide in the besieged Gaza Strip, where thousands of Palestinians have been killed.
The vote comes after Israel announced it was recalling its ambassador Eli Belotserkovsky from Pretoria "for consultations".
The African country has not had an ambassador in Israel since 2018.
More to come…

The Democratic Republic of Congo will move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday.
Netanyahu, who met Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi during the United Nations General Assembly, announced in a statement that Israel would also be opening an embassy in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Only a handful of countries have their embassies in Jerusalem, with most others maintaining their diplomatic representation in the coastal city of Tel Aviv, Israel's main economic hub. Some of those still in Jerusalem include the  , Guatemala and Honduras.
Earlier this month, the Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea   its embassy in West Jerusalem.
Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. However, most of the world does not recognise Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, believing its status should be resolved in negotiations.
Palestinians also want the capital of their independent state to be in the city's eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Six-Day War.

'It's scary': Israel war fears batter Lebanon's struggling economy

Beirut, Lebanon – Yara Adada, 28, sits at the window of her bakery and coffee shop in Gemmayze, a lively central Beirut neighbourhood known for its bars and restaurants.
Adada is the only one there. 'We're swatting flies,' she says.
Behind her, the counter is filled with pastries, the coffee machine is silent and the chairs and stools, usually full, are empty. Since the beginning of the conflict between Hamas and Israel, this has been the scene at Adada's coffee shop and many other businesses as fears grow that the country could be   with Israel.
'We've seen a very significant drop in customers, more than 50 percent,' Adada said. The usually buzzing coffee shop would get between 30 and 35 customers a day. 'Now, on a good day, I have 10 to 15. Today it's already midday and I only had one.'
'Yesterday I only made $4. It's scary,' she said.

Economic 'agony'
Since October 7 and the beginning of the ongoing   between Hezbollah and Israel in southern Lebanon, the restaurant sector has seen a drop of up to 80 percent in business, according to Lebanon's syndicate for restaurants, nightclubs and cafes.
Tourism, responsible for 20 percent of Lebanon's gross domestic product (GDP), has been hit badly. Due to the volatile situation at the border, Australia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United Statesand many other nations have not only urged their citizens not to visit Lebanon but have advised those in the country to leave while there are still commercial flights available.
The warnings came as airlines such as Lufthansa, SWISS and Saudia cancelled their flights. On October 20, Lebanese flag carrier Middle East Airlines announced it was reducing its flights 'due to the ongoing circumstances in the region and the reduced insurance coverage for aviation risks in times of war'.
The decision, criticised by the government, has led to a drop of 80 percent in the Lebanese airline's flights. At the Beirut airport – the only one in the country – there are now few planes on the tarmac, no queues, and hardly any passengers.
'The restaurant [sector] is completely devastated,' Nagi Morkos, from Hodema, a Lebanon-based consultancy firm, told Al Jazeera. Morkos, who works with restaurants, hotels, resorts and malls, said the operators are 'anxious'.
'The biggest concern is not the war, it's the status quo that will keep the situation like that for months. So it's an agony more than a death,' Morkos said. 'A war, yes, it's terrible, but war has a time. Here we don't know, it's a wait-and-see situation.'
'We feel trapped and it's very bad for business, very bad for tourism, very bad for the hospitality sector and very bad for investment.'

It's not 2006 any more
On October 22, the Lebanese government announced that it was developing an emergency plan in case a  . The measures included securing key infrastructures, like the Beirut airport, ports and main roads, all of which were bombed by Israel during its conflict with Hezbollah in 2006.
But Lebanon and the region are in a different, more challenging, situation than in 2006: Lebanon's banking system was relatively normal back then, which allowed the central bank to provide banks with liquidity if necessary during the war; likewise, there was still confidence in financial systems and millions of Lebanese expats were still sending foreign currency into the country.
In 2006, although the Beirut airport was bombed, Middle East Airlines continued to operate from Damascus throughout the monthlong conflict and goods and people were still able to cross the border from and to Syria. But war in Syria and frequent Israeli air raids on Damascus airport mean that option is gone.
Lebanon is also almost completely   for food, fuel and medicine, 70 to 80 percent of which arrive by sea.
In 2006, the country's ports were unusable because of the threat of Israeli warships but Lebanon could fall back on healthy reserves, such as grains, that were kept in the Beirut port silos, which have since been destroyed by the  .
The still half-destroyed port can be seen from the office of the Lebanese minister of economy, Amin Salam.
He tells Al Jazeera Lebanon is in a worse position than ever and that food security is one of the main concerns for the government as it develops its emergency plan for possible war.
Lebanon at risk of food security 'disaster'
Lebanon's current reserves of food, fuel and medicine are only enough for a worrying two to three months, the minister said, adding that reserves should normally be enough to last for 'about a year'.
'[B]ecause of the lack of vision of the past governments, nobody thought of building several locations for national reserves. Everything was put in the Beirut port and when the explosion happened, we lost the only national reserve we had," Salam said. 'So if it doesn't get delivered on the seaport, we don't have wheat, we don't have grains, we don't have bread.'
Salam said the government is working with private partners to increase the shipment of basic commodities in the coming weeks. However, vendors are asking for payments in advance 'because they know [Lebanon's] banking system is paralysed … so that's kind of creating another layer of obstacles', he explained.
Hani Bohsali, president of the Syndicate of Food Importers in Lebanon (IFBC), was one of the representatives who met Salam.
He told Al Jazeera that, just like in aviation, insurance companies for the maritime shipping industry have started charging premiums or lifting their war coverage completely, which is resulting in an inflation of consumer good prices by up to 3 percent.
'If I bring my shipments without war insurance and then the port gets hit and I lose my cargo, who will compensate me? Nobody… people [may reduce] their inputs to reduce their risk," he said.
Bohsali is confident that current shipments already on their way to Lebanon won't be affected. But while future orders have not been cancelled so far, the situation has to be assessed 'on a daily basis'.
'Let us put it in a very cynical way: realistically, we don't know. Nobody knows,' Bohsali said. 'If the war breaks, what scenarios can you do if the Syrian border is closed and there is an embargo on the seas? Even if you do 100 contingency plans, it's a waste of time if you don't know what will happen.
'So what we, the private sector, are calling for is asking the government to just do its best to stop the war, because that's the only option.'
Lebanon's Economy Minister Amin Salam [File: Mohamed Azakir/Reuters]
'Forget about tomorrow, deal about today'
Salam recognises that Lebanon is at risk of a 'disaster' if war breaks out. But, he concedes, the country's financial woes did not start on October 7.
When he took office in 2021, Lebanon was already facing one of the worst financial crises in modern times, with losses standing in excess of $72bn, a 98 percent devaluation of the national currency, 80 percent of the population living below the poverty line, and the central bank in ruins after its governor was charged with defrauding the public finances to the tune of $330m.
An agreed   from the International Monetary Fund has been seen as the light at the end of the tunnel, but implementation of the reforms it is conditional on has been slow.
"Everything that's happening now is adding … another layer of chaos and lack of attention to the reforms needed to rebuild the Lebanese economy because … when something like this escalates, it takes us 10 steps backwards,' Salam told Al Jazeera. 'When you are dealing in crisis mode, you forget about the tomorrow, you have to deal about the today.
'[O]ur infrastructure is very, very, very bad. And our economy is in a very challenging place,' the minister said. 'We cannot afford even … a little escalation.'

A high price to pay
Adada, the cafe owner, knows well the burden of the 'cycle of crisis' in Lebanon: the 28-year-old became unemployed after the 2019 financial collapse and remained jobless during the pandemic and the Beirut port blast. Hers was one of the first shops to open in the Gemmayze neighbourhood opposite the port after the explosion.
Almost everybody she knows warned her against opening a business in Lebanon, she said. But it was her dream to stay and help the economy. 'It's home,' she said.
She is not giving up yet. Despite the high cost of utilities and the growing prices of ingredients, Adada has enough savings to keep the shop afloat for at least six months.
'If a war breaks out I can close the shop for a while but I worry about my employees and other stores that aren't as lucky,' she said.
Adada sympathises with the Palestinian people and their struggle, but she knows well the price Lebanon might have to pay.
It is a complex sentiment shared by many in Lebanon. 'We cannot be selfish but we have to,' Adada says, looking out the window.
Outside, a few cars pass. Even fewer pedestrians walk around the usually vibrant neighbourhood.
'Lebanon doesn't deserve this, we've been through enough,' she says. 'Just let us breathe.'

Doha, Qatar – Al Jazeera's Sanad Agency has investigated the Israeli claim that the bombing of Gaza's al-Ahli Arab Hospital was the result of a rocket misfire from Palestinian Islamic Jihad and not a result of Israel's relentless bombing of the Gaza Strip since October 7.
Sanad's investigation analysed time-coded footage from several sources, including a live broadcast by an Al Jazeera journalist at the time.
Also analysed was live footage of Gaza from Israel, which clarified that the live Al Jazeera broadcast lagged by 35 seconds.
The investigation reveals that Israeli statements seem to have misinterpreted the evidence to build a story that one of the flashes recorded by several sources was a rocket misfire.
Based on a detailed review of all videos, Sanad's analysts conclude that the flash Israel attributed to a misfire was in fact consistent with Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system intercepting a missile fired from the Gaza Strip and destroying it in mid-air.
