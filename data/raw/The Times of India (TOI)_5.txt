Thiruvananthapuram: KPCC president K Sudhakaran said they will organize a rally in Kozhikode beach to declare solidarity with the Palestinian people on November 23. All secular-democratic believers are being mobilized to attend the rally.
“Innocent Palestinians are being massacred by the Israeli forces on their homeland. The Congress cannot support any action that takes away the right of the Palestinian people to live in the land of their birth. The Congress governments from the time of Jawaharlal Nehru to Manmohan Singh had a tradition of supporting the struggle of the Palestinian people to live with dignity, peace, and respect. This is the position that the Congress has always been upholding,” said Sudhakaran. 
“The rally will be a platform to expose the hypocrisy of the CPM, which is abusing the plight of the Palestinian people for political gain and electoral gain in Kerala,” he said. tnn

MUZAFFARNAGAR: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind president, Mahmood Asad Madani, condemned the ongoing conflict in Israel and Palestine, especially the attacks on civilians in Israel and bombardment of heavily-populated residential areas in Gaza.

They are like prisoners in their own homeland..."Madani pointed to the "unwavered support for the Palestinian cause" by Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. "The PM of India should play a larger role and use his influence for peace and an immediate end to the loss of civilian lives," he added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Thrissur: BJP leader M T Ramesh criticised the stand of both CPM and the Congress on the Israel-Palestine conflict. He said that both parties were trying to appease the sympathizers of Hamas in the state and did not have genuine concern for the people of Palestine. 
Ramesh alleged that an organized effort was underway to create religious polarization by the CPM and Congress with the hope of making gains in Parliament elections. He termed the solidarity rallies held by the two parties ‘Pro-Hamas rallies’. TNN

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPM politburo member M A Baby has come in support of Palestine and termed Israel "a terrorist country". The Hamas attack is only a retaliation to what the Israel has done earlier, he said."If you are labelling Hamas a terrorist organization, then you will have to accept the fact that Israel also is a terrorist country. The time has come to declare Palestine as an independent country with eastern Jerusalem as its capital," Baby told reporters in New Delhi on Sunday.Baby said one should not forget the fact that this year till date 248 Palestinians were murdered and among them 40 were children. It is a fact that casualties have occurred in the Israeli part also. The conflict between the two has been continuing for the past few years. "The UN security council should meet immediately and put an end to the conflict. The UN should take steps for declaring Palestine as an independent nation. This is the only solution to stop the bloodshed in the region," Baby added.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israel exacting revenge from blameless: Sonia Gandhi

New Delhi: Congress leader Sonia Gandhi has slammed India's abstention from the vote on the recent UN general assembly resolution on the West Asia conflict.In a newspaper article, she asserted that valuing the relationship with Israel does not erase the fact that Palestinians have been dispossessed from their homeland of centuries. "There can be no peace without justice," she said.Sonia attacked BJP without naming the party and said that "contrary to some mischievous suggestions", Congress' longstanding principled stand has been for a two-state solution, which has also been India's historic position. She said while the MEA in its October 12 statement mirrored the Congress line, it came only after Israel started the assault on Gaza. "The PM had made no mention of Palestinian rights in the initial statement expressing complete solidarity with Israel," she lamented. Sonia said Congress took no time to condemn the terrorist attack by Hamas, but Israel is now focused on exacting revenge from a population that is "as helpless as it is blameless". Sonia said "humanity is on trial now", and urged for the loudest and most powerful voices to be for ceasefire. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

NEW DELHI: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday fired his interior minister who accused police of being too lenient with pro-Palestinian protesters.The government said Braverman has left her job as part of a Cabinet shuffle.The 43-year-old Goan-origin Cabinet minister has repeatedly courted controversy in her senior UK Cabinet role, most recently by accusing the Met Police of “playing favourites” when tackling aggressive Israel-Gaza protests in an article in The Times.“Our brave police officers deserve the thanks of every decent citizen for their professionalism in the face of violence and aggression from protesters and counter protesters in London yesterday. That multiple officers were injured doing their duty is an outrage,” Braverman had said in a statement on Sunday evening following far-right violence during the protests over the weekend.“The sick, inflammatory and, in some cases, clearly criminal chants, placards and paraphernalia openly on display at the march mark a new low. Antisemitism and other forms of racism together with the valorising of terrorism on such a scale is deeply troubling,” she added. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Chandigarh: A seminar on the Israel-Palestine conflict and Pakistan crisis was organised by the department of defence and national security studies in collaboration with the fans club forum for awareness of national security at Panjab University on Friday. RSS leader Indresh Kumar, who attended the event, said, "If nations, Palestine, mourn Hamas, it shows an acceptance of terrorism as a political tool. The crucial question revolves around whether Palestine and Hamas are an inseparable entity; if so, they fall under the category of terrorists." Kumar expressed concern about nearly half of the global population being embroiled in war and drew parallels between the Hamas attacks and the Pakistan crisis. He also highlighted instances of national administrations aligning with Pakistani terror groups. tnn

Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday said India had always taken a pro-Palestine approach in the Israel-Palestine conflict and it was "unfortunate" that the country has deviated from its traditional stand.
"The previous Indian governments had adopted a favourable and empathetic stand towards the Palestinians. It is unfortunate that a slight deviation happened in this latter," he told a news conference here. Terming the ongoing developments in West Asia and the recent attack on Israel as "utmost serious" issues, Vijayan said India could play a key role in reinstating peace in the region.

NEW DELHI: NCP working president and Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule said on Thursday the Union government should convene an all party meeting to discuss India's stand on the Israel-Palestine issue. Her comments came in the backdrop of PM Narendra Modi's statement expressing solidarity with Israel, which Sule said was "different" from India's traditional line on Israel and Palestine. "India's policy on the Israel-Palestine conflict had been consistent until now. It was the same policy for Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Indira Gandhi as PM. India always had one line on this issue, but the central government is taking a different line. When such issues pertaining to external affairs arise, an all-party meeting should be held," she said.

PARIS:  World powers need to stop talking about the idea of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict and instead put forward practical proposals to make it work once the war in Gaza ends, Italy's foreign minister said on Thursday.Speaking in Paris after a humanitarian conference on Gaza, Antonio Tajani said Rome had sent a naval hospital ship from Naples on Thursday morning to the region, but he emphasised resolving the conflict would need some more creativity to create a perspective for peace."We have to put ideas on the table. I don't find any other solutions than the United Nations if we want peace," he told reporters. "We have to move forward and try to convince."Tajani suggested that after the war in Gaza had been finished, creating a U.N. peacekeeping mission like in Lebanon could be one area to explore. Italy contributes some 1,300 soldiers in Lebanon.Diplomats say such an idea would be complicated given Gaza is not a state, the Palestinian Authority is weak, the UN Security Council is divided and there is little appetite from Western countries to send troops to the Middle East.

Hamas' underground city is big challenge to Israel's ground offensive

NEW DELHI: As Israeli tanks and military forces amass at the Gaza border with the intent to invade the 360-sq-km coastal strip in retaliation to the October 7 attack by Hamas -- what awaits them is “a web of tunnels beneath Gaza”.Estimated to be at least 8 metres below ground, the network of hundreds of kilometres of tunnels will be a formidable challenge to Israeli forces, which until now have been pounding the strip with airstrikes.One of the hostages who was recently released by Hamas referred to the tunnel network as a “spider web”.Western and Middle Eastern sources familiar with the “Hamas metro”, as the network is sometimes known, told Reuters the the tunnels are being used for smuggling, storage as well as a base to launch attacks.Several top US officials have warned Israel that its forces will be walking into a trap and will find it next to impossible to breach the tunnel network successfully without suffering mass casualties.US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said Iraq's nine-month-long battle to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State might prove to have been easier than what awaits the Israelis.“There are likely to be a lot of IEDs (improvised explosive devices), a lot of booby traps, and just a really grinding activity,” he said.Despite significant investments by Israel in tunnel detection, including the deployment of a sensor-equipped underground barrier, known as an "iron wall", it is believed that Hamas still maintains operational tunnels connecting to the outside world.After the last round of confrontation in 2021, Hamas leader Yehya Al-Sinwar, who is thought to be hiding underground ahead of Israel's ground offensive, had said: "They started saying they destroyed 100kms of Hamas tunnels. 
I am telling you, the tunnels we have in the Gaza Strip exceed 500 km. Even if their narrative is true, they only destroyed 20% of the tunnels."However, there is no concrete evidence backing Sinwar’s claim.But the estimate of hundreds of kilometres is largely acknowledged by security analysts, even though the blockaded coastal strip is only 40km (25 miles) long.‘We walked kilometres underground…’Israel exerts full control over Gaza's air and sea access and possesses 59 out of the 72 kilometres of land borders (with Egypt situated 13 kilometres to the south). Consequently, tunnels serve as one of the primary means for Hamas to smuggle in weapons, equipment, and individuals.While Palestinian groups have been discreet about their networks, recently released Israeli hostage, 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz, said: "It looked like a spider's web, many, many tunnels," adding: "We walked kilometres under the ground."Hamas believes that, given Israel's significant aerial and armoured military superiority, tunnels offer a means to mitigate some of these advantages by compelling Israeli soldiers to operate in confined underground spaces familiar to Hamas fighters."I won't elaborate on the number of kilometres of tunnels but it is a high number, built under schools and residential areas," an Israeli military spokesperson told Reuters.‘Hamas leadership pretty much intact’Israeli security sources told Reuters that despite heavy aerial bombardments, the tunnel infrastructure has sustained minimal damage, allowing Hamas naval commandos to launch a seaborne attack targeting coastal communities near Gaza this week."Although we have been attacking massively for days and days, the (Hamas) leadership is pretty much intact, as is the ability to command and control, the ability even to try and launch counter-attacks," Amir Avivi, a former brigadier general whose senior positions in the Israeli military included deputy commander of the Gaza division, tasked with tackling tunnels told Reuters."There is a whole city all over Gaza underneath with depths of 40-50 metres. There are bunkers and headquarters and storage and of course they are connected to more than a thousand rocket launching positions," he added.One Western security source told the agency: "They run for miles. They are made of concrete and very well made. Think of the Viet Cong times 10. They have had years and lots of money with which to work with."Another security source, from one of Israel's neighbouring countries, said Hamas's tunnels from Egypt remain active."The supply chain is still intact these days. The network involved in facilitating coordination is some Egyptian military officers. It is unclear if there is knowledge of this by the Egyptian army," he said.A few narrower and deeper smuggling tunnels were still operational between Egypt and Gaza until recently, reported the agency quoting two security sources and a trader in the Egyptian city of El Arish. However, their activity has reportedly slowed down since the Israel-Hamas war began.Professor Joel Roskin, a geomorphologist and geologist with Israel's Bar-Ilan University told Reuters that it was difficult to map the tunnel network accurately from the surface or space as highly classified information would be required for 3D mapping and imagery visualisation.One of Israel’s elite units responsible for subterranean operations is Yahalom, a specialised commando force within Israel's Combat Engineering Corps, often referred to as the "weasels." Their expertise lies in the detection, clearance, and demolition of underground tunnels.Earlier this week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Yahalom fighters, telling them: "I rely on you, the people of Israel rely on you.""There are going to be a lot of booby traps. They have thermobaric weapons that they didn't have in 2021, which are more lethal. And I believe they acquired a lot of anti-tank weapon systems that are going to try to hit our APCs (armoured personnel carriers), tanks," Amnon Sofrin, a former brigadier general and former commander of the Combat Intelligence Corps told Reuters.Daphne Richemond-Barak, professor at Israel's Reichman University and author of the book Underground Warfare told the agency that the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had changed the situation."What the IDF (Israeli military) is likely to face inside the tunnels is also all of the experience and all of the knowledge that has been gained by groups like ISIS (Islamic State) and has been ... passed on to Hamas."Hamas, formed in 1987 in Gaza, began tunnelling in the mid-1990s, taking advantage of the increased freedom granted in Gaza. These tunnels have given Hamas an advantage in Gaza compared to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Tunnels became more accessible after Israel's 2005 withdrawal and Hamas's 2006 election victory. They were used for attacks and smuggling, with substantial profits from items like bullets and rifles.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu faces fire after blaming intelligence chiefs for Hamas attack, issues apology

NEW DELHI: In a sign of growing rift in Israel's war cabinet amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had to issue an apology to his intelligence and security chiefs on Sunday just hours after he accused them of not informing him about the widescale attack that Hamas was planning against Israel."I was wrong. Things I said following the press conference should not have been said and I apologize for that. I give full backing to all the heads of the security arms. I am strengthening the Chief of Staff and the commanders and soldiers of the IDF who are at the front and fighting for the house. 
together we will win," he tweeted.No warning given: Netanyahu on Hamas attackIsrael was blindsided by a well-coordinated multi-pronged attack from Hamas on October 7 that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Since then, Israel has been bombarding the Gaza Strip, resulting in the deaths of over 7,000 Palestinians. Israel has also vowed to send in troops into Gaza to permanently "eradicate" Hamas. Shortly after the October 7 attack, top officials from the heads of the Israeli military and domestic spy service the Shin Bet, all acknowledged their failures in predicting or spotting the threat. Even the country's finance and education ministers accepted responsibility.Netanyahu, however, has yet to do so. He has only said there would be time to ask tough questions, including of himself, after the war.Netanyahu's post, which has since been deleted, had said: "At no time and no stage was a warning given to Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding war intentions of Hamas. On the contrary, all security officials, including the head of army intelligence and the head of the Shin Bet, estimated that Hamas was deterred and interested in an arrangement."The remarks caused a political uproar from the opposition as well as Netanyahu's own ministers.Tide turning against Netanyahu?Benny Gantz, a former defence minister who is now in Netanyahu's war cabinet, said on X that Netanyahu should retract what he said and let the matter go."When we are at war, leadership must show responsibility, decide to do the right things and bolster the forces in a way that they can carry out what we demand of them," Gantz said, adding: "Any other action or statement - harms the people's ability to stand and their strength.""The PM must retract his statement and stop dealing with the issue," he added."At midnight, when our soldiers are in Gaza or in the area, it's best to pray for them and support them," said National Unity minister Chili Tropper. "We definitely shouldn't be settling scores with them."Israel's military spokesperson declined to respond to the row, simply stating: "We are now at war, focused on the war."Opposition lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman, once Netanyahu's defence minister, said the PM's remarks show that "he (Netanyahu) is not interested in security, he is not interested in hostages, only politics".Yossi Cohen, who headed the Mossad spy agency under previous Netanyahu governments, said: "You take responsibility from the beginning of your job, not from the middle."Netanyahu's finance minister Bezalel Smotrich also spoke out against the PM's statement, saying that weakening the IDF's commanders was wrong. He added that now was the time to be responsible and to support and strengthen one another even when they are wrong.'Netanyahu has crossed a red line'Opposition leader Yair Lapid said Netanyahu had crossed a redline with his statement. "While the IDF is heroically fighting against Hamas and Hezbollah, he [Netanyahu]is working on attempts to put the blame on them instead of backing them up," he said. "The attempts to escape responsibility and put the blame on the defense system weakens the IDF while it's fighting Israel's enemies," he added.He also posted a video of a statement he made just before Yom Kippur where he said he had been warned by defense officials that Israel was about to find itself in a multi-front war."The intelligence materials that I was basing off of were given to Netanyahu as well," he said. "Those who gave the intelligence were the same defense people that Netanyahu is now blaming for not warning him."Lapid has accused the Netanyahu government of still being in "shock" over three weeks after the Hamas attack.“The government isn’t present for those who have been evacuated from their homes, those who were abducted by Hamas, survivors, those with family members called up as army reservists, and schoolchildren whose education schedule has been disrupted,” Lapid said.“It’s impossible to go on this way,” he added.

NEW DELHI: India has sought to balance its support to Israel on the issue of Hamas terrorism by expressing concern over mounting civilian casualties, underlining the significance of international humanitarian law and reiterating its long-standing support for a sovereign, independent and viable Palestine state. In his talks with President Mahmoud Abbas, PM Modi had told him that Indian will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Palestine. India's aid has come not a moment too soon as the Arab world, the West and even neighbours like Bangladesh and Pakistan line up humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians.India has otherwise supported Palestine through its contributions to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). India is a member of its advisory commission since 2020. "India increased its annual contribution to UNRWA from $1.2 million to $5 million in 2018. Since 2002, India has contributed a total of $36.5 million to UNRWA till 2022- 23," said an official. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Day 9 of the latest Israel-Hamas warMany people in Gaza were told by Israel to leave the northern part of their land. Some went to hospitals in the north for safety. Gaza, a place with about 2.3 million people, is struggling to get enough food, water, and safety. They are also worried about an upcoming invasion after Hamas, a militant group, attacked Israel and caused harm. 
Israeli forces, with support from the US warships, are getting ready to fight in Gaza. They trained near the Gaza border for a fight using air, land, and sea to stop the militant group. Israel used flyers and social media to tell over 1 million Gaza residents to go to the southern part of Gaza for safety.Currently:1. Many people in northern Gaza are struggling to leave, and there's a shortage of water because Israel has stopped sending supplies to Gaza.2. The military from Israel said on Sunday that they won't attack a certain route south for a few hours. They are asking Palestinians to leave the north together. The day before, they gave more time and two safe paths to leave. They mentioned that many people have already gone south.3. Israel has not decided to send soldiers into the area, but they are gathering their troops near the border of Gaza.4. Since Hamas started attacking on October 7th, more than 3,600 lives have been lost in this war.5. Gaza's hospitals will run out of fuel for emergency power in two days, says the United Nations. This is dangerous for thousands of patients.Israel and Hamas at warIsrael is getting ready to take strong action against Hamas, a militant group. They want to stop the violence caused by Hamas in Israeli towns near the border.American warships are heading to the area because the situation might get worse between Israel and Hamas. There are already fights happening near Israel's border with Lebanon.Israel has told people in Gaza, a place with over 2 million residents, to move to the safer southern part of the area. Many have left Gaza City, where about half of the people live. However, Hamas wants them to stay where they are.Gaza hospitals are overwhelmed with patientsIn Gaza, hospitals are running out of fuel and supplies, putting many lives at risk. People are struggling to find enough food, water, and safety, fearing an upcoming ground attack by Israel, triggered by a deadly Hamas assault.Israeli forces, along with support from US warships, are positioned along Gaza's border, preparing for a significant campaign to dismantle Hamas.The week-long airstrikes have caused massive destruction, but haven't stopped Hamas from firing rockets into Israel.The Gaza Health Ministry reported a high death toll and many injuries, making this conflict the deadliest for both sides in Gaza's history.Efforts are being made to reopen a border crossing into Gaza for aid delivery, as the region faces immense challenges due to the ongoing violence. The US is working with various countries and the UN to facilitate aid delivery and evacuation of foreign nationals.Nikki Haley, Israel and the Politics of DiplomacyDanny Danon, Israel's representative at the United Nations, got a call from Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and President Donald Trump's new ambassador to the United Nations.Haley was calling to say sorry.A month before this, the United Nations Security Council had criticized Israel for constructing buildings in the West Bank. The Obama government, by not voting, let the criticism pass, which was a way of showing dissatisfaction to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister.In her first call to a fellow ambassador, Haley wanted to make sure things changed."She promised that it wouldn't happen as long as she was an ambassador," Danon remembered, "and that she would support us."This promise shaped much of Haley's time at the UN During her almost two years as ambassador, she became known for strongly defending Israel.Oil prices fall as investors assess impact of Israel-Hamas warOn Monday, the prices of oil dropped a bit after going up on Friday. People are watching to see if the situation between Israel and Hamas involves more countries. If it does, the prices of oil might go higher, which could hurt the global economy.The cost of Brent futures went down by 34 cents to $90.55 per barrel, and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropped by 41 cents to $87.28 a barrel.Experts say people are trying to understand what will happen because a major ground fight hasn't started yet, even after Israel told people in the northern part of Gaza to move to the south.In timeline of attacks in Israel, wait for help seemed to be endlessOn a national holiday in Israel, the response from their forces was slow. During this time, Hamas militants took advantage and entered over 20 towns outside Gaza. They caused a lot of harm, killing at least 1,200 people and holding around 150 people as hostages.Israeli officials haven't explained why their response was slow. We'll share what we know about the timeline of these terrible events and how the authorities responded, based on what survivors and their families have told us, along with analyzing photos and videos.Before the attacks happened:Early in the morning on October 7, Israeli intelligence noticed something unusual happening in the militant groups in Gaza. They quickly informed the Israeli soldiers who were protecting the border with Gaza.When the attacks began:At about 6:30 am, the most dangerous attacks in Israel's history began simultaneously in many locations. People with powered parachutes (paragliders) took off from Gaza. The militants used small flying robots (drones) to destroy Israeli surveillance stations and started shooting a lot of rockets. Special forces on trucks and motorcycles rushed into southern Israel.6 hours after the attacks started:At 12:21 pm, the Israeli military shared that they had sent soldiers and additional forces to southern Israel to take back the towns that Hamas attackers had captured.20 hours after the attacks started:Around 3 am on October 8th, in Kfar Aza, Okev was saved from a secure room.

Thiruvananthapuram: CPM politburo member M A Baby has come in support of Palestine and termed Israel "a terrorist country". The Hamas attack is only a retaliation to what the Israel has done earlier, he said.
"If you are labelling Hamas a terrorist organization, then you will have to accept the fact that Israel also is a terrorist country. The time has come to declare Palestine as an independent country with eastern Jerusalem as its capital," Baby told reporters in New Delhi on Sunday.
Baby said one should not forget the fact that this year till date 248 Palestinians were murdered and among them 40 were children. It is a fact that casualties have occurred in the Israeli part also. The conflict between the two has been continuing for the past few years. 
"The UN security council should meet immediately and put an end to the conflict. The UN should take steps for declaring Palestine as an independent nation. This is the only solution to stop the bloodshed in the region," Baby added. tnn

SHAMLI: Two persons were arrested in UP's Shamli for allegedly posting 'inflammatory content' related to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict on their WhatsApp accounts. According to police, Farman Haider, 24, and Farman Malik, 26, both residents of Kairana, expressed their support for Palestine through WhatsApp posts. These were seen as potentially 'detrimental to religious and social harmony' as the Indian government has expressed support for Israel.Acting on inputs, police booked the duo and initiated legal proceedings.

Israel exacting revenge from blameless: Sonia Gandhi

New Delhi: Congress leader Sonia Gandhi has slammed India's abstention from the vote on the recent UN general assembly resolution on the West Asia conflict.In a newspaper article, she asserted that valuing the relationship with Israel does not erase the fact that Palestinians have been dispossessed from their homeland of centuries. "There can be no peace without justice," she said.Sonia attacked BJP without naming the party and said that "contrary to some mischievous suggestions", Congress' longstanding principled stand has been for a two-state solution, which has also been India's historic position. She said while the MEA in its October 12 statement mirrored the Congress line, it came only after Israel started the assault on Gaza. "The PM had made no mention of Palestinian rights in the initial statement expressing complete solidarity with Israel," she lamented. Sonia said Congress took no time to condemn the terrorist attack by Hamas, but Israel is now focused on exacting revenge from a population that is "as helpless as it is blameless". Sonia said "humanity is on trial now", and urged for the loudest and most powerful voices to be for ceasefire. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

The ongoing hostilities between Israel and Hamas have so far caused thousands of deaths and internally displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The conflict triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel and the taking of hostages is now heading towards a humanitarian crisis where Gaza is under siege and in desperate need of aid.The use of force against the civilian population has triggered pro-Palestine protests around the world and counter-protests in support of Israel's actions. The analysis of past data shows that despite the heavy skew in the number of dead and injured among the two sides, peace has eluded this part of the world. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Hyderabad: Madhya Pradesh BJP affairs in-charge P Muralidhar Rao on Friday said that BRS and Congress did not condemn the attacks of Hamas on Israel as part of their 'appeasement' politics. 
Addressing a press conference at the state party office here, he said: "PMNarendra Modi has immediately expressed his empathy for Israel but TRS after becoming BRS and considering itself as a national party should have come forward to condemn this dastardly act of Hamas." 
He said Hyderabad has a history of facing terror attacks and BRS should have condemned the attacks. "But, it is keeping mum, which means it is empathising with Hamas," he said.
He accused Congress of indirectly supporting Hamas. "They condemned the attack but also said the latest tension was because of long-standing issues between Israel and Palestine. It amounts to supporting the heinous acts of Hamas."
