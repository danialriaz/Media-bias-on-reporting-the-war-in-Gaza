Palestinian man, son attending funeral procession in West Bank shot dead

Israeli settlers have killed a Palestinian man and his son in the occupied West Bank during a funeral procession, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says.
Ibrahim Al-Wadi and his son Ahmed Al-Wadi were shot on Thursday when settlers opened fire at a funeral for four Palestinians killed on Wednesday by settlers and Israeli soldiers in the village of Qusra near Nablus.
The two were killed as a group of Palestinian men tried to remove car tyres put on the street by settlers to block the funeral procession.
Ibrahim's brother, Abdul Azim, told Al Jazeera that the father and son confronted the settlers along with other Palestinian men as they tried to clear the way for the funeral. He said some men threw rocks to clear the road.
The Israeli army intervened at that point, Azim said, and both settlers and Israeli soldiers opened fire on the Palestinians attending the funeral, killing the father and son.

Qusra, a Palestinian village with half a dozen illegal Israeli settlements, is in the northern part of the occupied West Bank.
Al Jazeera's Ayman Nobani had spoken to Ibrahim on Wednesday by telephone after the four Palestinians were gunned down.
Ibrahim said the settler attacks on Palestinians in Qusra were systemic and had been going on even before the   began on Saturday.
(Al Jazeera)
The four killings on Wednesday happened after a large number of settlers stormed the house of Mahmoud Odeh, a Palestinian killed by the settlers in 2017.
To protect his family, Odeh's son Awad climbed on the roof of the house to call for support from other residents in the village.
As people arrived, Ibrahim told Al Jazeera, the settlers and Israeli soldiers "initiated live fire directly on the upper bodies of [the men]", injuring at least 11, including children.
Awad, who was still on the rooftop, was shot in the neck and jaw, Ibrahim said, adding that he was taken to a hospital in Ramallah where his condition was serious but stable. Four others – Abada Odeh, Moaz Odeh, Musab Abu Rida and a child identified as Hassan Odeh – were killed in the attack.
Ibrahim said at least three other Palestinians had injuries from live bullets fired by the Israeli army. He said the settlers in the area had threatened the residents of Qusra.
'We will crush the people of Qusra at their sites,' Ibrahim said, repeating the threat.
"Fears exist as the village is surrounded by six settlements from the southern and eastern sides," he said. "They are taking advantage of the ongoing war and the cover available to them to implement their plan."
Nobani said Ibrahim's last words to him were: "We will confront with all our might and defend our people and our land."
Tensions are running high in the occupied West Bank since Saturday when Hamas fighters launched an unprecedented attack inside Israel, which responded by a   of the besieged Gaza Strip.
At least 1,400 Palestinians have been killed and more than 6,200 wounded in the enclave, whose 2.3 million residents –   – live in what is commonly referred to as the  .
At least 27 Palestinians have been killed in raids by the Israeli army in the West Bank since Saturday.   have also reportedly killed several Palestinians in the region, which is under a   due to the war.
Nida Ibrahim, Al Jazeera correspondent in Ramallah, said settler attacks on Palestinians average three a day. There have been more than 800 such attacks since the start of the year, she said.
"This is a crime. These are acts of genocide and cold-blooded murder that have no justification," said Mahmoud Al Aloul, vice president of the Fatah Movement as he stood in front of Rafidia Surgical Hospital in Nablus after Ibrahim and his son's killings on Thursday.
"It was a funeral for martyrs, and the people attending the funeral were shot too, which led to more martyrs," he said.
"This is the main characteristic of the Israeli occupation, its state and its settlers. Their actions always affirm that we have no choice but to resist, resist their policies that aim to exterminate the Palestinian people."

France bans pro-Palestine rallies, cracks down on protesters amid Gaza war

The French police have used tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters who took to the streets in support of the Palestinians, shortly after the government moved to ban all such rallies.
Police broke up a rally in capital Paris on Thursday, following orders from Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin to ban all pro-Palestine demonstrations in the name of 'public order'. Critics called the order an attack on civil liberties.
"We live in a country of civil law, a country where we have the right to take a stand and to demonstrate. [It is unfair] to forbid for one side and to authorise for the other and that does not reflect the reality of Palestine," 29-year-old Charlotte Vautier told the Reuters news agency.
The ban came as Israel   the Gaza Strip for a sixth day, killing more than 1,400 people, wounding thousands and wiping out neighbourhoods in the already-besieged territory now under a total siege.
The bombings began on Saturday after the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched an   inside the Israeli territory. More than 1,300 people have been killed in Israel and at least 100 taken captive by Hamas.
French minister Darmanin also said at least 24 people have been arrested across France for 'anti-Semitic acts' since Saturday, adding that he believes any foreigner who commits such acts should be expelled from France 'without delay'.

France is home to Europe's largest Muslim and Jewish communities, and events overseas can sometimes increase tensions domestically.
No restrictions have been announced for events in support of Israel.
"Let's not add, through illusions or calculations, domestic divides to international divides," French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday. "The shield of unity will protect us from hatred and excesses."
Macron said 13 French citizens were killed in the Hamas attack, while 17 others, including children, are missing. Some could be among the dozens of people, including Israelis and foreigners,   by Hamas in Gaza.
"France is doing everything alongside Israeli authorities and our partners to bring them home safely because France never abandons its children," Macron said, adding that Israel has the right to destroy Hamas but must do so while 'preserving civilian populations'.
Macron also said a   to the violence must include an independent Palestinian state.

'Appalling': Why has Biden cast doubt on the Palestinian death count?

October 26th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - The list of Palestinians killed in the   stretches for more than 150 pages, at times featuring dozens of people with the same last name: Entire families have been wiped out by Israeli air attacks.
The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza released  the list on Thursday, documenting the deaths of more than 7,000 Palestinians, including nearly 3,000 children, since the war began on October 7.
Each name is paired with a government identification number — a step meant to indicate transparency.
But less than 24 hours earlier, United States President   cast doubt over the figures, saying that he has "no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using".
"I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed," Biden said on Wednesday.
For Palestinian rights advocates, the US president's comments are another episode in his administration's push to "dehumanise" Palestinians and dismiss their suffering, as Washington continues to support Israel's bombing campaign.
Moreover, critics were quick to point out that human rights experts, including at the United Nations, have long found the Palestinian Health Ministry's data to be reliable.
Palestinian American activist Zeina Ashrawi Hutchison said Biden's remarks seem to question Palestinians' humanity "even in death".
"The president's statements are outrageous, irresponsible and flat-out racist and anti-Palestinian," she told Al Jazeera.
Nonprofit finds statistics 'reliable'
Biden's publicly professed doubts come as the US continues to resist calls  and instead continues to pledge military support for Israel.
Yara Asi, a Palestinian American public health expert at the University of Central Florida, called the president's remarks "appalling".
"To dispute those figures was really, really just putting both feet in with Israel on this, in yet another way that dehumanises Palestinians," Asi told Al Jazeera.
With Israel preventing foreign journalists or researchers from entering Gaza as the conflict intensifies, the territory's health ministry has become the go-to source for understanding the Palestinian death count.
While it is difficult — if not impossible — to independently verify the numbers released from Gaza, Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director at   (HRW), said the ministry's data has often reflected the nonprofit's own research.
Shakir said when HRW previously conducted its own investigations into past attacks on Palestinians, it did not find major discrepancies between its findings and the numbers provided by the health ministry.
"Human Rights Watch has been working in the occupied Palestinian territories for three decades. We've covered rounds of escalations and hostilities, and we've always found the numbers from the Ministry of Health to be generally reliable," Shakir said.
He distinguished formal figures released by the ministry from comments made by individual health officials in Gaza, saying that the ministry has access to data from hospitals and morgues, which allows it to more accurately assess the death toll.
In fact, Thursday's report noted that the current death toll does not include people who have been killed but were not brought to hospitals or registered at morgues.
Shakir also noted that the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) relies on the health authority's data, which has also been cited by the US State Department .
In the current war, the Israeli military has said it dropped thousands of  , including   in the first six days alone.
"We've been looking at  . We've been looking at what's taking place. The numbers coming out of the ministry are not beyond reason," Shakir said. "They're within the range of what one would expect from air strikes of this intensity."
An OCHA spokesperson in the occupied Palestinian territories also told Al Jazeera on Thursday that the UN agency continues to use the ministry's figures.
"The United Nations relies on the Health Ministry in Gaza as a source for casualties figures in that area," the spokesperson said in an email.
"We continue to include their data  in our reporting and it is clearly sourced. It is nearly impossible at the moment to provide any UN verification on a day-to-day basis."
'How much lower?'
On top of casting doubt over Palestinian accounts, the Biden administration has consistently rejected any independent investigations into suspected Israeli war crimes, including by the  .
For example, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier this week that an international investigation into the explosion at the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital that killed hundreds of people in Gaza would not be "appropriate at this time".
Instead, he cited what he said was Israeli evidence that the explosion at the hospital was caused by a misfired Palestinian rocket. Palestinian officials have said the explosion was the result of an Israeli attack.
We are deeply disturbed & shocked by the dehumanizing comments that @POTUS  made about the almost 7,000 Palestinians slaughtered by the Israeli government over the past two weeks. The Israeli govt has openly admitted to targeting civilians, journalists have confirmed high numbers https://t.co/dSn616CHcV
- CAIR National (@CAIRNational) October 25, 2023
Likewise, when Israeli forces killed Al Jazeera journalist   last year, Israel's authorities initially claimed that the reporter was shot by Palestinian gunmen. In turn, the Biden administration also opposed any formal, independent investigation into the incident.
Several Palestinian Americans told Al Jazeera that Biden's statement about the Palestinian death toll only furthers the case that he is wholeheartedly adopting the  at the expense of Palestinian victims.
'As if the president hadn't already been complicit enough in the dehumanisation of Palestinians, now he says he doesn't trust us when we say we are being murdered," Palestinian American activist and comedian Amer Zahr told Al Jazeera.
"How much lower could one stoop than to say we are lying about dying?"
For her part, Asi, the public health expert, said the Biden administration understands that civilian casualties are "extremely unpopular".
"So if you both cast doubt on Palestinian numbers but support no investigations — not even foreign journalists entering Gaza — what you're really saying is: The death count does not matter because we're going to support this regardless. We're going to find ways to justify it," she said.
Dana El Kurd, a non-resident senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC, echoed Asi's comments.
"This is incredibly dehumanising and casts suspicion   writ large," El Kurd told Al Jazeera. "The assumption is that they are always lying and that they are always inaccurate narrators of what's happening to them."

US says no framework agreed yet for Israel-Saudi normalisation deal

US President Joe Biden's administration has said more discussions need to happen before a   to normalise relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel can be reached.
White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday that the two countries have not agreed on a shared framework for negotiations, playing down speculation over a possible deal that news outlets have reported could include a US security guarantee for  .
"There's still a lot of discussing to happen here," Kirby told reporters.
"There is no agreed-to set of negotiations, there's no agreed-to framework to codify normalisation or any of the other security considerations that we and our friends have in the region."
Fostering stronger ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel – two top US allies in the Middle East – has become a   of the Biden administration's policy in the region.
While Washington has not commented on the specifics of a potential Israeli-Saudi normalisation agreement, US officials have said they are seeking such a pact.
But critics have questioned whether making concessions to move a deal forward is in the US interest and whether an agreement would include significant gains for the Palestinians.
Kirby said on Wednesday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet Biden "somewhere in the US" later this year, but did not specify whether a meeting would take place at the White House.
In the past, the possibility of normalisation with   was seen as a form of leverage that could be used to extract concessions from Israel towards the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
But Palestinians, citing the hardline policies of Netanyahu's   government, have expressed little confidence that closer ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel will translate into significant changes to their situation.
Israel has continued to   in the occupied Palestinian territories, and Palestinians in the West Bank have been hit by the deadliest wave of Israeli military violence in years.
Still, the US has made promoting so-called Israeli "normalisation" deals a key plank of its Middle East policy.
And the Biden administration has thrown its support behind what are known as the  , a series of agreements that were brokered between Israel and Arab countries under Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump.
During a visit to Washington, DC last month, Israeli President Isaac Herzog thanked the US "for working towards establishing peaceful relations between Israel and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — a leading nation in the region and in the Muslim world".
"We pray for this moment to come," Herzog said during an  .
For its part, the Saudi government has not officially changed its position in support of  , which conditions recognition of Israel on establishing a Palestinian state and finding a 'fair solution' for Palestinian refugees.
It remains unclear what would be included in a potential Israeli-Saudi normalisation deal.
In late July, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman said Biden was pursuing a plan that involves giving Saudi Arabia NATO-like security guarantees and helping the Gulf kingdom kick-start a civilian nuclear programme.
Axios journalist Barak Ravid also reported on Wednesday that Netanyahu is seeking a US security guarantee as part of the  .
"The exact parameters of Neyanyahu's proposed agreement are not known," Ravid reported, but he said Israeli officials have said the proposal will focus on US security guarantees around Israel's perceived threats from Iran.

Putin concerned over 'catastrophic' civilian deaths in Israel-Gaza war

Russian President Vladimir Putin has voiced concern at the "catastrophic increase" in the number of civilians killed in Israel and the Gaza Strip amid   between Hamas and the Israeli military.
The Russian leader also took aim on Tuesday at  , which he said had failed by not taking the needs of Palestinians into account.
Putin, whose military has been accused of killing   since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, expressed his concern for civilians killed in Israel and Gaza during a phone call with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Kremlin said in a statement.
The "emphasis was placed on the sharply worsening situation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone', the Kremlin said of the leaders' discussion.
"Deep concern was expressed about the continuing escalation of violence and the catastrophic increase in the number of civilian casualties," the Kremlin said.
The two leaders reiterated the need for "an immediate ceasefire" and for "the resumption of the  ", the Kremlin added, saying that Erdogan noted it was "regrettable to target civilian installations and that Turkey doesn't welcome such acts".
Earlier on Tuesday, Putin called the creation of a Palestinian state "necessary" and blamed the latest explosion of violence on US policy in the region.
"I think that many people will agree with me that this is a vivid example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East," Putin said at the start of a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani on Tuesday.
Putin said Washington had sought to "monopolise" efforts at forging peace between Israel and Palestinians, and he accused the US of not bothering to seek compromises acceptable to both sides but instead had pushed its own ideas for a solution to the conflict.
The US had ignored the interests of Palestinians, including their need for their own independent state.

Putin made no mention of Russia's role in the Middle East peace process. Along with the US, the United Nations and the European Union, Moscow has since 2002 formed part of a "Quartet" of powers charged with helping to mediate Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin was in touch with both warring sides in Israel and Gaza and would seek to play a role in resolving the conflict. Peskov did not specify how that would be achieved.
"We intend to keep making efforts and play our role in terms of providing assistance to seek ways to a settlement," he said.
 
Since the latest crisis erupted, the Kremlin has sought to appear even-handed, underscoring its relations with both Israelis and Palestinians.
Moscow has longstanding ties with the Palestinians, including Hamas, which sent a delegation to Moscow in March. But it also has "a lot in common" with Israel, including the fact that many Israelis are former Russian citizens, Peskov said.
Peskov also warned that the current violence was "more than worrying".
"It has the potential to be dangerous by growing and spilling over from the current zone of the Arab-Israeli conflict,' he said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that it was ready to help reach a settlement between Israel and Palestinians by coordinating regional players.
'We are in close contact with the leading regional players, whose role in stabilising the situation and creating conditions for establishing direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue is indispensable,' ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency.

The October 1973 War: How it led to the first Arab recognition of Israel

The   lasted for barely three weeks but it shook the world economy and culminated in the Camp David Accords that saw Egypt become the first Arab country to establish diplomatic ties with Israel.
The war, known to Israelis as Yom Kippur and to Arabs as the October War, started when Egypt and Syria launched a two-front attack on Israel to regain their territories lost in the 1967 Six Day War when Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and Syria's Golan Heights.
Israel also seized large parts of historic Palestine, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in 1967. The defeat of Arabs and Palestinians is known as  , meaning setback or defeat.
Egypt regained control of Sinai but Syria's Golan Heights remains occupied by Israel.
The aftermath of the war contributed to the shifting political dynamics between Arab nations and the United States.
(Al Jazeera)
Here are some of the key events that took place in the wake of the war:
The 1973 oil crisis
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) led by Arab countries imposed an oil embargo on the US after accusing Washington of supplying weapons to Israel in the war that ended in a stalemate.
The aim was to use the oil embargo to pressure the US to resolve the Palestinian issue.
They pledged to maintain this until all the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 were relinquished and the rights of Palestinians were restored.
Oil prices shot up around the world, causing the US to reassess its support for the war.
Even though Israel did not pull out from the occupied Palestinian territories, the embargo on the US was lifted in 1974 following peace talks.
The oil crisis was a shock to economies worldwide, causing the oil price to quadruple from around $2.90 a barrel before the embargo to about $11.65 a barrel in January 1974.
To avoid a future shock, the International Energy Agency (IEA) was created as a response. The Paris-based intergovernmental organization works to ensure the security of oil supplies.
Camp David Accords
Former US President Jimmy Carter brokered a series of peace talks between Egypt's then-President Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin, the former Israeli Prime Minister.
These secret discussions that took place in Camp David, a country retreat for the US President near Washington, DC, spanned over 13 days.
The accords laid out conditions for an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, and a framework for Israeli-Palestinian peace using Resolution 242, which called for a withdrawal of Israel from territories occupied during the Six Day War in 1967.
Israel agreed to pull out its forces and civilians from Sinai in exchange for diplomatic ties with Egypt and access to the Suez Canal after the Camp David Accords signed in 1978.
While Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, the framework never materialised.
Egypt suspended from the Arab League
Egypt was expelled from the Arab League, and all Arab countries broke diplomatic relations with Cairo following its normalisation with Israel.
Egypt was accused of disregarding the Palestinian cause, but 50 years on more Arab countries are eager to establish ties with Israel relegating the Palestinian issue to the side.
Jordan followed Egypt in signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 while several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, recognised Israel as part of the so-called Abraham Accords in 2020.
Cairo was brought back to the Arab League in 1989.
Fifty years after the Arab-Israeli war, Israel continues to occupy the Palestinian territory of West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. The US   the Golan Heights as Israeli territory.

Gaza war pushes tumultuous Israel-Turkey ties into 'deep freezer'

November 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Istanbul, Turkey– The mounting death toll in Gaza has seen Turkish politicians, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, become increasingly   of Israel.
Erdogan recently said he had severed ties entirely with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel's onslaught, although he did not lower the level of communications between the governments.
'Netanyahu is no longer someone we can talk to. We erased him and threw him away,' the president told reporters as he returned from an overseas trip on November 3.
A freeze on several fronts
Erdogan's comments suggest he has 'thrown into the deep freezer, if not ditched altogether, the rapprochement that Turkey and Israel had been pursuing,' said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at political risk advisory group Teneo.
Those efforts at mending ties followed a decade of tensions, after Israeli commandos stormed the  , a Turkish aid ship,in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists. The vessel was trying to break Israel's blockade and deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza.
On November 4, Turkey's foreign ministry   to Tel Aviv, citing Israel's refusal to accept a ceasefire, 'continuing attacks against civilians', and denying free entry to humanitarian aid.
It was the culmination of a sharp dive in ties since October 7.
On October 20, Erdogan said Israel's operations amounted to 'genocide'. At a rally on October 28, Erdogan referred to Israel as a 'war criminal' over its bombardment of Gaza since Hamas's cross-border assault three weeks earlier.
That same day, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen issued a formal recall of all Israeli diplomats from Turkey.The volume of trade between the two countries has also dropped by 50 percent since October 7, Turkey's trade minister, Omer Bolat, told a news conference in Kuwait last week.
The fracture is the latest in Turkey's often stormy but generally beneficial relationship with Israel since its establishment as a state in 1948.
Early recognition of Israel
The relationship between Turkey and Israel since the latter's formation has generally been characterised by warmer ties.
Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel's sovereignty in 1949, less than a year after it declared independence. Ankara officially opened its first diplomatic office in Israel in 1950.
Continued Palestinian support
Still, Turkey's support for Palestinian self-determination has been constant throughout, even as it has tried to keep relations with Israel afloat.
During the 1967 Six-Day War, Ankara joined calls for Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian land it occupied — the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights — but resisteddemandsfromArab statesto sever diplomatic links with Tel Aviv.
In 1979, Yasser Arafat travelled to Ankara to open the Palestine Liberation Organization's office. The following year, relations with Israel were again strained over what Turkey called Tel Aviv's 'unconciliatory' policy, which included Israel's decision to claim Jerusalem as its capital.
But when Turkey recognised Palestine as a state in 1988 — becoming the first country with diplomatic ties with Israel to do so — it declined to grant the Palestinian envoy full diplomatic status, after Israeli complaints.
Shared interests with Israel
By the 1980s, trade and tourism between Turkey and Israel were growing. State-owned Turkish Airlines started direct flights to Israel in 1986.In 1993, a Turkish foreign minister visited Israel for the first time.
From the mid-1990s, there was close cooperation in the areas of defence and intelligence between the two states — both of which were closely supported by the United States and shared concerns about potential threats from neighbours such as Syria, Iraq and Iran.
Two defence agreements were signed in 1996, paving the way for a strategic military partnership that included the upgrading of F-4 and F-5 jet aircraft, M-60 tanks and helicopters.
Turkey, Israel and the US participated in joint aerial and naval exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean until 2009.
Erdogan's balancing act
Turkey continued with its ties with Israel after the landslide election victory for Erdogan's Justice and Development Party in 2002. Erdogan visited Tel Aviv as prime minister three years later, presenting himself as a possible mediator between Israelis and Palestinians.
In 2004, Erdogan condemned Israel's assassination of Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin as 'state-sponsored terrorism', reflecting wider Turkish support for Palestinians, and Hamas in particular.
Yet, during high-level visits in 2006 and 2007, Turkey worked to resolve tensions between Syria and Israel over Syria's involvement in Lebanon and support for Palestinian groups and Hezbollah.
In 2007, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul offered to help secure the release of three captured soldiers: Gilad Shalit, who was held by Hamas from 2006 to 2011, and Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev who were both held by Hezbollah from 2006 until their bodies were returned to Israel in 2008. Israeli President Shimon Peres at the time thanked Turkey, as well as Egypt and Germany, for helping release Shalit.
The three-week war on Gaza in 2008-2009 reinforced tensions between Turkey and Israel.
The breakdown
The assault on the Turkish aid ship Mavi Marmara led to a diplomatic falling-out, which saw Ankara expel the Israeli ambassador.
Official ties remained frosty until 2016 when the two countries agreed to a compensation deal and a pathway to normalising relations.
But two years later, two events put a pause on those normalising efforts: dozens of Palestinian protesters were killed by Israeli security forces at the separation fence Israel built around Gaza and the US decided to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
Despite rekindled diplomatic tensions, business between Turkey and Israel continued to boom. Between 2010, the year of the Mavi Marmara incident, and 2021, trade volume more than doubled from $3.4bn to $8.4bn.
Over the last two years, Erdogan has sought to improve the relationship with Israel as part of a wider foreign policy of smoothing over fractious ties with regional powers such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Last year, Israeli President Isaac Herzog visited Ankara and ambassadors were appointed in both capitals. Erdogan met Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time in September and they both pledged greater cooperation between their countries.
The horrors of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Erdogan's hardening rhetoric, however, appear to have stalled those plans.
Last month, he cancelled any  . Early in the current war, Erdogan spoke to multiple world leaders and   between Hamas and Israel. That suggestion, said Piccoli of Teneo, appeared to have evaporated in recent days.

Fans of Scotland's Celtic Football Club have pledged to continue their display of solidarity with the people of Palestine and 'show the world that the club stands with the oppressed, not the oppressor' in the wake of   on the besieged Gaza Strip and despite backlash from the club's board.
The Green Brigade, an ultras group of hardcore Celtic fans, displayed banners saying 'Free Palestine' and 'Victory to the resistance!!' during the club's Scottish Premiership match against Kilmarnock in Glasgow last week.
The fans based at the North Curve section of Celtic Park unfurled large Palestinian flags before kickoff and continued to wave them during their side's 3-1 win.

Two days later, the club's board responded with a strongly worded statement saying, 'Celtic is a football club and not a political organisation' and distanced itself from the fan group's show of solidarity.
'The club has always made clear that political messages and banners are not welcome at Celtic Park, or any match involving Celtic.'
Israeli international and former Celtic midfielder Nir Bitton criticised the fans on social media, saying they had been "brainwashed".
"Shame on you!!! Yes free Gaza from Hamas not from Israel!!" he said on Instagram.
"Supporting terror organisation who's proudly celebrating the slaughtering of families is absolutely crazy."
However, the fan group remained undeterred and called on all Celtic fans to raise the Palestine flag during the club's UEFA Champions League match against Atletico Madrid on October 25.
'We must apply learning from apartheid South Africa to dismantle apartheid Israel – if we are neutral in situations of injustice, we have chosen the side of the oppressor,' the Green Brigade said in a statement this week.
"We send our sincere solidarity and prayers to our friends across all of Palestine at this traumatic time when yet again much of the international community turns its back in cowardice while war crimes are inflicted on a largely defenceless, imprisoned population," the statement added.

Israel has been bombarding the Gaza Strip since Saturday after the Palestinian armed group Hamas carried out deadly attacks inside the country.
Israeli air strikes have killed more than 1,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 6,600, according to officials in the besieged enclave.
More than 1,300 people were killed and 3,000 injured in Hamas's multipronged attack on towns in southern Israel, according to Israeli officials.
'True values of the club'
The Green Brigade's show of solidarity is 'incredibly important to the Palestinian people, who are being bombarded and targeted', according to Abdullah Al-Arian, associate professor of history at Georgetown University in Qatar.
'By choosing to be on the side of justice for an oppressed population, these fans are representing the true values of the club and are more in-tune with the history of the club than the current board happens to be,' Al-Arian told Al Jazeera.
Al-Arian said it is 'becoming increasingly hard' to show support for the Palestinians in Western countries because some governments in Europe have   against the Israeli attacks in Gaza and have threatened to ban the display of the Palestinian flag.
Al-Arian, author of the book Football in the Middle East: State, Society, and the Beautiful Game, underlined the importance of using football stadiums to raise awareness for such causes because they are "the last democratic spaces where people come together and express themselves in a way that cannot be censored, drowned out or criminalised the way that we see in the general public discourse.
"Especially as we see the posture of the media and government as being one silencing and intimidation of people who are simply standing up for human rights of the people of Palestine.
'Football matches are viewed by millions around the world where people get to witness these acts of solidarity and they help create a common bond for people who want to stand for justice for the people in Palestine.'
According to the fan group, the board's statement "is sadly in step with much of the political and media class", and it questioned why similar political messaging was welcome at Celtic Park to show solidarity with Ukraine but is being condemned now.
"The question on any reasonable mind should be why? Why are Ukrainian lives more sacred than Palestinian lives?" it said.
By the way, this picture (at a Celtic away match) is over ten years old.
Suppression of support for Palestine has very long been an establishment priority.
Who else is going to show so much public support for #Palestine  apart from the #Celtic  fans. More power to the Celts. pic.twitter.com/zWllqzQglP
- Marco Hilley (@marcohilley) October 8, 2023
Long association with Palestine
Celtic fans have a history of supporting Palestinians and have raised funds for independent organisations working in the occupied territories.
In 2019, the Aida Celtic football academy was opened at the Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank with help of funds raised by the club's fanbase.
The club has received widespread support in all Palestinian territories in recent years, and Al-Arian said the club's backing of the Palestinian cause offered support to people "who are on the front line in a brutal assault on their lives".
'It tells Palestinians that people all over the world stand with them despite their respective governments taking immoral stances and turning a blind eye to the collective punishment and atrocities,' he said.
Celtic's fierce local rival Rangers have, in turn, supported Israel whenever both teams have met in the Old Firm - local derby - fixture over the years.
The blue-and-white-kitted Glasgow club held a minute's silence for the people killed in Israel ahead of their Premiership match last weekend.
According to Al-Arian, the contrasting stances show that football is 'never really separated from politics'.
He said Celtic's community of fans grew out of the working class segment of society and have adopted a number of causes as part of their identity.
'They use these causes to fuel their support for the club and to honour values that become deeply ingrained in the club and its fans.'
The Green Brigade said it remains "unequivocal in support for the Palestinian people".
"We call on the Celtic support – the true custodians of Celtic Football Club – to stand on the right side of history."

November 4th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in cities across the world for a weekend of demonstrations demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
Pro-Palestine demonstrations took place on Saturday in various cities including Washington, DC; London; Paris; Berlin; Milan and Dhaka. In Turkey, a convoy of Palestine supporters headed to a US military base in the south of the country for a protest to coincide with US Secretary of State  's arrival to the country on Sunday.
On Saturday, at least 15 people were killed and dozens more wounded in an Israeli attack on al-Fakhoora school in  , as Israel continued its air and   of the besieged enclave.
Since the war began, 9,488 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza.   have died in Gaza in this war so far than in all conflicts around the world in each of the past four years, according to the charity Save the Children. More than 1,400 people in Israel have died, mostly in the October 7 attacks by Palestinian group Hamas on southern Israel.

United Kingdom
Large crowds held sit-down protests in London blocking Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus before marching to and gathering in Trafalgar Square.
Protesters held 'Freedom for Palestine' placards and chanted 'ceasefire now' and 'in our thousands, in our millions, we are all Palestinians'.
London's Metropolitan Police estimated that around 30,000 attended the rally. Police said they had made 11 arrests, including one for displaying a placard that could incite hate, contrary to terrorism legislation.
Earlier, some demonstrators had also gathered outside the BBC headquarters in London in protest at the network's coverage of the war, which they called 'biased'.
Echoing Washington's stance, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government has stopped short of calling for a ceasefire, and instead advocated humanitarian pauses to allow aid into Gaza.
France
Thousands also marched in central Paris to call for a ceasefire with placards reading 'Stop the cycle of violence' and 'To do nothing, to say nothing is to be complicit.'
It was one of the first, big gatherings in support of Palestinians to be legally allowed in Paris since the war began.
"We came here today to show the people of France's solidarity with the Palestinian people and our support for peace, for a peace solution with two states, an Israeli state and a Palestinian state," said Antoine Guerreiro, a 30-year-old civil servant.
Wahid Barek, a 66-year-old retiree, lamented the deaths of both Israeli and Palestinian civilians.
"I deplore civilian deaths on both sides. Civilians have nothing to do with these actions. It really is shameful," he said.

Germany
In Berlin, about 6,500 people gathered at midday for a demonstration that police said was taking place under strict conditions. Germany had previously banned Palestine solidarity rallies.
People carrying Palestinian flags and placards reading "Stop the genocide in Gaza" or "   – we demand equality" gathered on Alexanderplatz, a major square in the centre of the city.
One speaker called for an end to the "apartheid culture" and a stop to the bombing of Gaza.
Italy
Some 4,000 protesters marched through the streets of Milan in support of a ceasefire, according to local media.
The demonstration called under the slogan 'Stop war, no racism' took place just as in a nearby square, the far-right League party held a rally 'in defence of the West'.

In the Senegalese capital, Dakar, people gathered outside the central mosque with placards and Palestinian flags.
'This protest was supposed to take place last week, but it was banned,' Al Jazeera's Nicholas Haque reported from Dakar.
'There are many Senegalese people, but also the Lebanese Senegalese community has also come out in numbers to show their support.'

Turkey
Hundreds of protesters gathered in Istanbul and Ankara, a day before a visit to Turkey by US Secretary of State   for talks on Gaza.
In Istanbul's Sarachane Park, they held banners that read, "Blinken, the accomplice of the massacre, go away from Turkey", with a picture of Israeli Prime Minister   and Blinken together with a red "X" mark on it.
In the Turkish capital, Ankara, demonstrators rallied near the US embassy, chanting slogans and holding posters which read: "Israel bombs hospitals, Biden pays for it."
Meanwhile, a '   for Palestine' headed to the Incirlik military base near the southern city of Adana, primarily used by Turkish and US forces. Organisers expects thousands of vehicles to converge around the base on Sunday.

United States
Tens of thousands took to the streets in Washington, DC in the largest demonstration since the war began on October 7.
'I am surrounded by a sea of protesters, more than I have seen since the war on Gaza started,' Al Jazeera's Heidi Zhou-Castro said.
'Organisers have called this the big one, they are expecting somewhere between 20,000 up to 100,000 people,' she added. 'The crowd around me isn't just Arab Americans who are rallying in support of Palestinians in Gaza, but also many Americans from all walks of life.'
A Jewish American protester attending a march for Gaza said President   needs to stop funding Israel's army.
'I'm a human being and I care about the people in Gaza being murdered. I care about genocide going on in the name of Jewish people by Zionists who do not represent Judaism,' he told Al Jazeera.
'I object to the US funding this genocidal war. That's what we're doing - it wouldn't happen if the US did not fund Israel,' he said.

'Fantasy land': How Biden's normalisation drive ignored Palestinians

October 11th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - Addressing the world at the United Nations   last month, United States President Joe Biden spoke of a "more sustainable, integrated Middle East" - one where Israel enjoys "greater normalisation and economic connection".
That vision seemingly demoted the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to a distant concern.
With a military occupation,  , walls and checkpoints in Palestinian territories like the West Bank and Gaza, a relatively stable status quo had been established — at least, on the surface.
This has allowed Israel and the US, its top ally, to largely ignore the plight of Palestinians and move on to other issues, experts say.
The Biden administration has been working with Israel on a broad range of subjects: a diplomatic deal with Saudi Arabia, a trade route linking   and concerns about Iran and its nuclear programme.
But regional order was shaken on Saturday when the Palestinian group Hamas launched a   against Israel from the besieged Gaza Strip, killing hundreds of people.
"This isn't just a blind spot. This is fantasy land, the way the US has been approaching this idea of   as if the Palestinian issue didn't exist," said Zaha Hassan, a human rights lawyer and fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Normalisation drive
Many experts and leaders in the region have warned that the Palestinian issue must not be sidestepped. Renowned rights groups, including Amnesty International, have accused Israel of imposing a  on Palestinians.
"No architecture for regional security and development can stand over the burning ashes of this conflict," Jordan's King Abdullah told the UN in September.
But the Biden administration has pushed on with decoupling its larger Middle East policies from Palestinians' demands for a viable state of their own, advocates like Hassan said.
The US recently admitted Israel to its exclusive  , a move critics have framed as a political perk for the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Normalisation with Saudi Arabia is another big prize sought by Israeli leaders that Biden and his aides were eyeing.
Few Arab states have recognised Israel since its inception in 1948, but former US President Donald Trump's administration helped secure a series of agreements in 2020 — known as the Abraham Accords — that established   between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco.
Sudan also agreed to normalise relations with Israel as part of Trump's push. Biden has been trying to expand the list of countries willing to forge relations with Israel.
His administration has also prided itself on establishing regional partnerships. At   in July this year, for instance, the US helped foster dialogue between Israel and Arab countries like Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco and the UAE.
Palestinian leaders, meanwhile, have   as a "stab in the back". Previously, the overwhelming majority of Arab states had conditioned forming ties with Israel on securing Palestinian rights as articulated in the  .
However, Biden administration officials have argued that, by continuing Trump's push for normalisation, Washington is strengthening security in the region.
Israel support
Dan Shapiro, the senior adviser for regional integration at the US State Department, told Al Jazeera Arabic  last week that the Biden administration is discussing Israel's normalisation with countries beyond the Gulf region — in Africa and East Asia.
Shapiro, a former envoy to Israel whose current role was recently created, went on to hail the "dramatic increase in security cooperation" between Israel and its new Arab partners.
"The United States sees it as very much in our interest to be a partner to those countries as they build those coalitions, so that they work with us and that we work with them and together we make the Middle East stronger and safer and more prosperous," he said.
While US officials have acknowledged that the push to forge formal relations between Israel and Arab countries is not a substitute for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, Washington has done little to revive prospects of establishing a Palestinian state.
And the Biden administration, which provides $3.8bn in annual aid to Israel, has been reluctant to hold the Netanyahu government accountable for violence against Palestinians and   in the occupied West Bank, in defiance of US policy.
At the UN General Assembly session last month, Netanyahu dismissed the idea that peace with Palestinians should be a condition for normalising ties with its Arab neighbours.
"We must not give the Palestinians a veto over new peace treaties with Arab states," he said.
Netanyahu also   of the region showing the Palestinian territories and Syria's Golan Heights as part of Israel — sparking fears among Palestinian rights advocates that their concerns were being erased amid talks of normalisation.
"I think what's happened Saturday and what's continuing to unfold is a clear reminder that the region cannot forget about the Palestinian situation that, left unresolved, will continue to stand in the way of a wider regional peace. And the US has to reckon with that now," Hassan said.
Palestinians 'will not disappear'
So far, it does not appear that the recent outbreak of violence has sparked a reassessment of US policy towards Israel.
On Tuesday, Biden portrayed   as a "terrorist" assault aimed at killing Jewish people, with no mention of the Palestinian struggle. He also compared Hamas to ISIL (ISIS).
Hamas officials have cited Israeli violations, including raids by Israeli forces at Al-Aqsa Mosque, as the reason behind the attack.
'Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond, indeed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks,' Biden said on Tuesday, pledging to support Israel's war efforts in Gaza.
But Khalil Jahshan, executive director of the Arab Center Washington. DC, a think tank, said the massive scale of hostilities shows that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot be overlooked in regional policies.
He said the situation is "telling the US, Israel and whoever else — particularly the long queue of Arab normalisers — that creating a new Middle East that serves mostly your economic purposes is tantamount to creating   for the Middle East without Palestine".
"The Palestinian people will not acquiesce to that, will not disappear and will not accept the crumbs that fall off the table of such events," Jahshan added.
As Biden calls for more support and weapons for Israel, Jahshan questioned what the long-term US strategy is.
"When do you stop? When do you look seriously at ending this conflict, at ending the occupation, at giving the Palestinian people a place under the sun — the right to determine their own future?"

Biden writes two different letters on Gaza war, reflecting his US audience

United States President Joe Biden has delivered two different messages on the   to pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel Americans, NBC News has reported , based on copies of official White House correspondence.
While one letter showcased   for Israel against Palestinian group Hamas's "terrorism", the other spoke about the US administration's efforts to protect  .
According to NBC, the letter sent to pro-Israelis invoked the Holocaust in relation to the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel. It also pledged continuous support to Israel and efforts to   taken by Hamas and being held in Gaza.
"The people of Israel lived through a moment of pure evil" that "resurfaced horrible memories" and amounted to the "deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust", NBC reported Biden's letter, dated November 1, as saying.
"The United States stands with Israel," it continued. "We will continue to ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against terrorism in accordance with international humanitarian law."
On the other hand, Biden's letter to pro-Palestinians focused on aid to Palestine and made no mention of the Holocaust or of US support for Israel.
"We mourn the many innocent Palestinians who have been killed," NBC reported Biden's second letter saying, dated November 8.
It added that the administration "is working closely with partners to ensure that life-saving assistance - including, food, water, and medicine can urgently reach innocent Palestinians in Gaza" and emphasised that "the United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilians during conflict".
While the two letters do not appear to contradict one another, or Biden's policies, NBC reported that it was not common for the White House to craft different versions of a letter on the same topic that vary so much in their emphasis.
It added that the incident "reflects the political tightrope Biden is trying to navigate as pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian elements of his coalition fray over the war", and with less than a year to go before elections.
 
In an opinion piece published on Saturday in the Washington Post, Biden wrote that Gaza and the occupied West Bank 'should be reunited under a single governance structure' - a revitalised Palestinian Authority.
"Gaza must never again be used as a platform for terrorism. There must be no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, no reoccupation, no siege or blockade, and no reduction in territory," he wrote, adding that "after this war is over, the voices of Palestinian people and their aspirations" must be at the centre of "post-crisis governance in Gaza".
Earlier this week, the US president and two of his cabinet members were being   as well as aiding and abetting 'genocide' in Gaza.
A federal complaint ( PDF ), filed on Monday against Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, accused them of 'failure to prevent and complicity in the Israeli government's unfolding genocide'.
The complaint noted that Washington was Israel's closest ally and strongest supporter, as well as its biggest provider of military assistance - with Israel being the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign assistance since World War II.
Because of this, it said, the US could have a 'deterrent effect on Israeli officials now pursuing genocidal acts against the Palestinian people'.
Also this week, police in riot gear   calling for a ceasefire outside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, DC.
Wednesday's protest came a day after many thousands of   gathered on the National Mall, holding placards with words like, 'Let Israel finish the job', 'From the river to the sea, Israel is all you'll see' and 'No ceasefire'.
At least 12,000 people, including 5,000 children, have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7, according to Palestinian officials. In Israel, the official death toll from Hamas's attacks stands at about 1,200.

China-Middle East summit told 'Israel seeks to end Palestinians' presence'

November 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel seeks to end the Palestinian people's presence on their "historical land," Palestine's foreign minister has said.
Riyad al-Maliki's comments came as diplomats from Arab and Muslim-majority nations met their Chinese counterparts in Beijing on Monday.
Beijing is hosting a delegation of foreign ministers from the Palestinian Authority, Indonesia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan for talks aimed at finding a solution to end the war in the Gaza Strip.
The summit, during which China pledged to work to "restore peace in the Middle East," is seen as part of a push by Beijing to step up its international role.
The Palestinian Authority's al-Maliki accused Israel of seeking to "bring to an end the Palestinian people's presence on what remains of its historical land," AFP reports.
A spokesperson for Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip will threaten peace, security and stability in the region and the world.
'Egypt is making every effort to bring aid into the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing, but Israel's policy of obstructing the entry of aid is a systematic policy aimed at pushing the Palestinians to leave the strip under the weight of bombing and siege,' the spokesperson said.
China, the host of the summit, has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinians. Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the visiting diplomats that his country could see that "a humanitarian disaster is unfolding in Gaza" and that it must be stopped.
"The situation in Gaza affects all countries around the world, questioning the human sense of right and wrong and humanity's bottom line," he said, before urging the international community to "act urgently" to prevent the war from spreading.
Following the outbreak of the war last month, Wang reportedly told his Saudi counterpart Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud in a phone call that 'Israel's actions have gone beyond self-defence".
Wang and other Chinese officials called for an immediate ceasefire and a "cooling down" of the situation.
Power vacuum
Beijing has repeatedly called for a two-state solution to end the war, which has now killed more than 13,000 Palestinian people in Gaza and some 1,200 in Israel.
Beijing's Middle East envoy Zhai Jun visited the region last month seeking a solution to end the war and has been in talks with Russia to work together to help Israel and Palestine reach a two-state solution.
At the summit, Wang highlighted again that Beijing is "a good friend and brother of Arab and Muslim countries".

"China firmly stands with justice and fairness in this conflict," he said.
"We are willing to work together with our brothers and sisters in Arab and Islamic countries to make unremitting efforts to settle the war in Gaza as soon as possible," he added.
The meetings are a sign that China is stepping up its international role by filling a power vacuum left by the US, according to political analyst Ibrahim Fraihat.
'The US has shot itself in the foot by throwing all of its weight behind Israel's side and by doing so, it has diminished its role as a credible third party intervener,' Fraihat, of the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera.
'They [Chinese authorities] are very interested in this role - they have strong ties with Israel, they have the trust of the Palestinians and weight in the international system,' he added, referring to China's veto power at the UN Security Council.

The US House of Representatives has rejected an effort to censure Palestinian American Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat who has been advocating for Palestinian rights amid  .
The measure, which was introduced by far-right Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, was halted in a 222 to 186 vote on Wednesday, with 23 Republicans joining the Democrats in opposing it.
A Democratic effort to in turn censure Greene was called off in response.
The so-called censure resolution against Tlaib accused the Michigan representative of "anti-Semitic activity, sympathising with terrorist organisations and leading an insurrection at the United States Capitol Complex", referring to a sit-in by Jewish activists inside Congress to demand a ceasefire in Gaza.

- Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (@RepRashida) October 26, 2023
Tlaib, the only Palestinian American member of Congress, had rejected the measure as rooted in bigotry.
"I will not be bullied, I will not be dehumanised, and I will not be silenced," she said last week. "I will continue to call for ceasefire [in Gaza], for the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid, for the release of hostages and those arbitrarily detained, and for every American to be brought home," she said in a statement.
She also called Greene's resolution "unhinged" and said it's "deeply Islamophobic and attacks peaceful Jewish anti-war advocates."
While the censure itself carries no practical effect, it leaves an historic footnote that marks a lawmaker's career.
Greene has not commented on the resolution to censure her but criticised the dozens of Republicans who voted against moving the Tlaib measure forward.
Tlaib was among one of the more than a dozen progressive legislators in the United States who last month introduced a   urging 'an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Israel and occupied Palestine'.
'All human life is precious, and the targeting of civilians, no matter their faith or ethnicity, is a violation of international humanitarian law,' the proposed resolution  read.
The war erupted on October 7 when the Palestinian group Hamas launched a   against Israel from the besieged Gaza Strip, killing more than 1,400 people, according to Israeli officials.
Israel responded with a relentless bombing campaign that has killed more than 8,700 Palestinians, according to authorities in Gaza. Meanwhile, an   on Gaza has cut off supplies of fuel and heavily restricted access to food, water and electricity in the densely populated enclave,  are filled with the dying and wounded and shortages have put huge  .
Last month, Tlaib had described the horrific humanitarian situation in Gaza, home to some 2.3 million people, saying "entire families are being wiped out" and criticising Democrat President Joe Biden and Secretary Antony Blinken for failing to call for a ceasefire.
Tlaib also stressed that the collective punishment of Palestinians is a war crime. 'See what's happening. Don't turn away. All they need to do is see Palestinians as human to see again that these are  ,' she said.

November 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Here is the situation on Friday,  12, 2023:
The latest developments
Israel continues to target hospitals in Gaza from the air as its ground forces have also surrounded several hospitals in the northern part of the besieged enclave. Ahmad Mokhallalati, a surgeon at the al-Shifa Hospital, told Al Jazeera that medical staff and patients 'are in the middle of the warzone'.
At least 13 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on a house in Khan Younis, health officials in Gaza said on Sunday.
Are Israel and the United States not on the same page about the future of Gaza? Washington has asked Tel Aviv to clarify Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments on 'not giving up security control of Gaza' that clash with US suggestions that the Palestinian Authority should take over the strip after Hamas is 'destroyed'.
Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said on Saturday in his second speech since the start of the war that the Lebanese war front remains 'active' and that the armed group has used new weapons against the Israeli military.
Major cities around the world, including New York, London, Melbourne, Paris, Baghdad, Karachi, Berlin and Edinburgh have  , involving hundreds of thousands, in support of Palestinians and an immediate ceasefire. Thousands rallied in Tel Aviv on Saturday to call for the release of captives held by Hamas in Gaza.
Human impact and fighting
More than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war. But the United Nations said on Sunday that the 'collapse of services and communications at hospitals in the north of Gaza' is delaying the Ministry of Health in Gaza from updating the numbers.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has lost communication with its contacts inside al-Shifa Hospital, and people have been targeted and killed while trying to get out.
At least   have died in the hospital due to power blackouts and dozens more are at risk.
Tens of thousands have fled the northern parts of Gaza in recent days as the Israeli military ramps up its operations there. But Israeli forces also   and other spots in the south, leaving no safe place in the strip. More than 70 percent of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are now displaced.
Diplomacy
Leaders from across the Arab and Islamic world convened on Saturday in Riyadh as Saudi Arabia hosted members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Arab League to discuss Gaza. They   justifying the Israeli aggression as self-defence and called for a ceasefire.
Tense talks are ongoing at the UN Security Council to break a deadlock that has prevented the world's most powerful decision-making authority from having any real effect on stopping the killing of civilians. A   has been circulated among members, coming after several failed efforts.
Ireland's parliament is expected to vote next week, based on a motion by the left-wing Social Democrats, on whether it will expel the Israeli ambassador.
No respite for the occupied West Bank
Israeli forces continue to exponentially intensify their raids in the occupied West Bank. Sources in the Palestinian Authority have told Al Jazeera that the number of raids has increased to about 40 per day in the past week.
The number of Palestinians killed in the occupied West Bank since October 7 has now risen to 185, and about 2,500 Palestinians have been arrested by Israeli forces in that time.
Families, many of them carrying children, are   areas in the occupied West Bank that are heavily raided, including the Jenin refugee camp.

Blinken discusses 'humanitarian pauses' as Israel encircles Gaza City

November 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that he discussed 'humanitarian pauses' with Israeli Prime Minister  , whose forces continue to hammer the Gaza Strip.
After arriving in Israel on Friday, the first stop in a trip to the region, Blinken emphasised US support for Israel but asked for steps to protect civilians and allow greater aid into Gaza.
"We believe that each of these efforts [to protect Palestinian civilians and increase aid into Gaza] would be facilitated by humanitarian pauses, by arrangements on the ground that increase security for civilians and permit the more effective and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance," the top US diplomat told journalists.
The visit has come as Israeli troops   after several days of intensifying ground operations in the strip, where it has pledged to dismantle the Palestinian armed group Hamas after a deadly attack on October 7 that Israel has said killed more than 1,400 people.

That attack, which included the   of civilians, among them women and children, has been widely condemned by global leaders and international organisations.
But criticism has mounted as Israel   to food, fuel, and electricity for Gaza's more than 2.3 million residents and levelled entire neighbourhoods with relentless air raids.
Palestinian authorities have said that more than 9,227 people, many of them women and children, have been killed by the constant bombardment, combining with   from Israel's siege to overwhelm Gaza's already fragile  .
Aid agencies and international groups have warned that a   is unfolding, and Palestinians in the besieged enclave have few options for seeking refuge.
Israel had instructed the population of Gaza's northern regions to move south, but no corner of the strip   from the attacks.
​​"Never have I been in a situation where we are effectively starved of the vital humanitarian supplies that we need to provide to people," said Tom White, director of the UN agency on Palestinian refugees, adding that most Palestinians in Gaza were surviving on one or two pieces of bread per day.
Speaking with members of the United Nations on Friday, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said that there has been 'some progress' on negotiations to allow   into Gaza.
"If we do not have pauses, we will not keep up with the needs of the people of Gaza and the Israelis also caught up in those areas of conflict," he said.
While the United States has continued to pledge full support for Israel and rejected growing calls  , it has started to temper those statements with discussion about the need to protect Palestinian civilians and allow aid into Gaza as the death toll mounts.
Blinken and US President   have both voiced support for pauses in the fighting to help facilitate the flow of humanitarian assistance, but Israel has firmly rejected those calls so far.
Netanyahu said there would be no 'temporary truce' until Hamas released all of the more than 240 people   on October 7, a group that includes Israeli soldiers and civilians, as well as foreigners.
Blinken said he also told Netanyahu the US wants to see Israel take concrete steps to crack down on   on Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, where 132 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers since the fighting began.

The unexpected return of former United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron to British politics during   and pro-Palestinian protests in Britain has sparked questions over the implications for the UK's policies towards the Middle East.
Cameron, now foreign secretary, has previously called the Gaza Strip   and advocated for a   to the Israel-Palestine conflict, but he has also been a staunch backer of Israel. On October 9, as Israel announced a   and pummelled the enclave in retaliation for a surprise attack two days earlier by the armed Palestinian group Hamas, the 57-year-old made his pronouncement in favour of the Jewish state.
'I stand in complete solidarity with Israel at this most challenging time and fully back the Prime Minister and UK Government in their unequivocal and steadfast support,' he said on X, including the blue and white Israeli flag in his post.

Hundreds of thousands of protesters have marched in London in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza over the weekend as a small number of far-right groups staged counterprotests.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak sacked   on Monday after she drew anger for accusing police of being too lenient with pro-Palestinian protesters and making comments described as 'inflammatory'.
He replaced Braverman with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly before announcing Cameron as Cleverly's surprise replacement.
Ben Whitham, professor of international relations at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London (SOAS), said that while Cameron was expected to strike "a more conciliatory tone', he would not be favourable to Palestinians in the conflict.
'Certainly, like any senior Conservative politicians, he is broadly going to side with Israel and its alleged right to carry out the offensive in Gaza,' he told Al Jazeera.
Whitham said Cameron's appointment was also aimed at 'healing some of the divisions within the Conservative Party'.
'He is seen as having strong ties to strategic economic partners in the Middle East,' including an ongoing personal relationship with Saudi Arabia's leadership, Whitman said.
'Prison camp'
During his tenure as prime minister from 2010 to 2016, Cameron criticised Israel's 'illegal' settlements in the occupied West Bank and the blockade of the Gaza Strip. 'Gaza cannot and must not be allowed to remain a prison camp,' he said on a visit to Turkey in 2010.
However, as Palestinians in Gaza benefitted from a fleeting ceasefire that temporarily halted one of the deadliest  , his party rejected calls from coalition members to re-examine arms export licenses to Israel should the fighting resume.
Israeli newspaper Haaretz cited the episode among the reasons why Cameron was the most pro-Israeli British prime minister ever, snatching the honorific title from 'ardent' supporters like Gordon Brown and Tony Blair and 'unabashed admirers of the Zionist endeavour' of the calibre of Margaret Thatcher and Harold Wilson.
'In many ways, he sees the Middle East very similarly to Netanyahu,' Haaretz said, referring to current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also held office from 2009 to 2021. Since last month, Netanyahu has repeatedly refused a ceasefire in Gaza and has promised to   in an aerial and ground offensive that has killed more than 11,200 Palestinians.
During the 50 days of hostilities lasting from July 8 to August 26, 2014, 2,251 Palestinians were killed. Sayeeda Warsi, a senior minister in Britain's Foreign Office and Britain's first Muslim to serve in the cabinet, resigned as the ceasefire collapsed and accused Cameron's government of taking a 'morally indefensible' approach to the conflict.
Warsi said at the time that the government's response to the events in Gaza was one of the factors behind the radicalisation of British Muslims, which could have consequences for years to come, citing early evidence from the Home Office.
Yet, the member of the House of Lords appeared to have buried the hatchet as she welcomed Cameron back on Monday. 'If ever there was a time for balanced, thoughtful, compassionate leadership it is now. Your country needs you,' Warsi said on X.
According to Whitham, the former prime minister's personal ties with Saudi Arabia have played a decisive role in his political reinstatement. Cameron was among a handful of leaders, including former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and former US presidential senior adviser Jared Kushner, to travel to Saudi Arabia in 2019 for the '  ' summit.
'We have [a pillar] in British foreign policy in the Middle East that is becoming more important in the post-Brexit context, which is that these foreign strategic allies outside of Europe, like Saudi Arabia, are really important,' Whitham said.
'Maintaining good relations with these partners comes above everything else," he added. "And Cameron is seen very much as a continuity candidate in this respect.'
Military involvement in the Middle East
Cameron has been a supporter of using Britain's 'military prowess' to defeat groups regarded as "terrorists" in the Middle East. In 2014, as ISIL (ISIS) sought to establish a "caliphate" in Iraq and Syria, he warned that the West faced having an 'extremist' state on the borders of the Mediterranean if ISIL succeeded in its goals.
His government agreed to extend air strikes into Syria from Iraq, where he voted in favour of an invasion when it was put to the British Parliament in March 2003.
'Probably the most controversial foreign policy decisions during Cameron's time as prime minister was the decision to use extrajudicial killings in Syria, which inaugurated a programme of drone strikes that continues to this day,' Whitham said.
Since his resignation in 2016 after his unsuccessful bid for Britain to remain in the European Union, Cameron's Middle East policy has been reviewed and found to have had a lasting impact for the region.
In 2011 when Britain and France intervened in Libya, Cameron's government said the operation was aimed at protecting civilians under fire from longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi. But the Foreign Affairs Committee later analysed the decision and found it had relied on flawed intelligence and hastened the North African country's political and economic collapse.
The parliamentary   that Cameron had a 'decisive' role in the decision to intervene and must bear the responsibility for Britain's role in the crisis in Libya.
Much like former US President Barack Obama, Cameron opened the path to the use of lethal force in parts of the Middle East, Whitham said. 'Cameron has demonstrated that he's quite keen on military intervention in the region,' he said.
'I wouldn't want to speculate on whether he will join the chorus of pro-Israel voices and potentially frame Hamas as an extension of ISIS. That will be down to the line Sunak takes and Cameron will have to toe that line.'

Deadly fighting erupts in Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon

At least two people have been killed in   among Palestinian factions in a refugee camp in southern Lebanon as a ceasefire agreement agreed earlier was not honoured by the rival sides, state media reported.
One person was killed in the fighting inside the Ein el-Hilweh camp and another was killed by a stray bullet outside the camp, National News Agency (NNA) said on Saturday, adding that several people were also wounded outside the camp by stray bullets.
The sound of heavy machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades echoed throughout the camp and its outskirts, witnesses told dpa news agency.
The clashes, which erupted on Saturday inside Lebanon's largest Palestinian refugee camp pitted members of the mainstream Fatah Movement and a Palestinian armed group calling itself Muslim Youth.
Reporting from outside the Ein el-Hilweh camp on Saturday, Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr said neither side is backing down in the deadly confrontation.
"Efforts to end the fighting have so far failed. Ceasefire agreements have broken down time and time again. The Fatah Movement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is at war with a number of armed groups that call themselves the Muslim Youth," Khodr said.
"Fatah is demanding that the Muslim Youth hand over eight suspects believed to be responsible for assassinating one of its senior commanders. They are also demanding that the Muslim Youth vacate positions that they have set up in UN-run schools inside the camp so that the academic school year can begin. So far, the Muslim Youth is refusing to do that," she added.
A public hospital which is located on the outskirts of the camp had to transfer all its patients to other facilities in the port city of Sidon because it was hit by several stray bullets.
'Does not serve the Palestinian cause'
Meanwhile, Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati discussed with President Abbas the volatile situation in an attempt to end the fighting.
Mikati called for an end to the fighting saying that what is happening in Ein el-Hilweh "does not serve the Palestinian cause and is harmful to the Lebanese state".
The Lebanese army said in a statement that it is taking measures, including contacting several sides, to work on ending the clashes. It also called on people to avoid getting close to areas of fighting.
The Ein el-Hilweh camp witnessed   at the end of July following the assassination of Fatah commander Mohammad 'Abu Ashraf' al-Armoushi and several of his aides.
The fighting at that time resulted in the deaths of 13 people.
Ein el-Hilweh is home to approximately 80,000 people, most are Palestinian refugees from the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948 and their descendants.
Palestinians from Syria have also arrived because of the war in the neighbouring country. There are some 12 camps hosting Palestinian refugees across Lebanon.

Gaza telecom companies warn of coming blackout

The two main telecommunications companies in Gaza have warned of a 'complete telecom blackout in the coming hours' due to a lack of fuel amid an Israeli siege on the Palestinian territory.
'Main data centers and switches in the Gaza Strip are gradually shutting down due to fuel depletion,' Paltel and Jawwal said in a joint statement on Wednesday.
The companies said 'all generators' operating network elements in Gaza have ground to a halt, and that basic network elements were now relying on batteries.
Our main data centers and switches in Gaza Strip are gradually shutting down due to fuel depletion. Currently, main network elements depend solely on batteries.
This will lead to a complete telecom blackout in the coming hours. #KeepGazaConnected
- Jawwal (@JawwalPal) November 15, 2023
'The countdown has begun for the halt of all communications and internet services in the Gaza Strip,' Laith Daraghmeh, CEO of the Palestinian telecommunication regulatory authority, said in a statement cited by the Turkish state news agency Anadolu.
He said talks were under way with international institutions 'to ensure the entry of quantities of fuel necessary for the operation of the communications service'.
On Sunday, Palestinian Communications Minister Yitzhak Sidr warned that all communications and internet services would stop in the Gaza Strip by Thursday due to depleting fuel.
Israel cut off fuel shipments into the Gaza Strip as part of a "complete siege" on the territory after Hamas fighters from Gaza launched an attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
Since the attack, Israel has bombarded the Palestinian territory, launched a ground offensive and severely restricted supplies of water, food and electricity. More than 11,400 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to Palestinian authorities, including more than 4,600 children.
The   to enter Gaza since Israel imposed the siege arrived in the besieged territory on Wednesday.
The UN agency for Palestine refugees said it received 23,000 litres of fuel, which Israel said could be used to transport aid coming in via Egypt. UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said that 160,000 litres a day are needed just to run basic humanitarian operations.
"It is appalling that fuel continues to be used as a weapon of war," Lazzarini said. "This seriously paralyses our work and the delivery of assistance to the Palestinian communities in Gaza."
Since Israel launched a ground invasion in late October, Gaza has experienced   previously, after Israel cut communications and internet services.
Humanitarian agencies and first responders have warned that blackouts severely disrupt their work and put lives at risk.
'Telecom blackouts enable Israel to cover up the mass atrocities being committed against the Palestinian people in Gaza and to maintain its chronic impunity,' said Al Mezan, a Gaza-based human rights group, in a statement.
Communications networks in Gaza have been unreliable since the war began due to lack of electricity and damage to infrastructure.
The Palestinian Ministry of Communications has previously appealed to neighbouring Egypt to operate communication stations near the Gaza border and activate roaming service on Egyptian networks.
The warning comes after the Israeli military entered Gaza's largest medical complex, al-Shifa, in what they called a "targeted operation" to search for Hamas weapons and infrastructure. Several people have been detained   at the hospital.
The raid comes after Israeli forces besieged the hospital for several days amid growing alarm over the deteriorating conditions in the facility, where the UN says thousands of people have sought shelter from the war. Hundreds of patients remain at the hospital, which ceased to function at the weekend due to a lack of fuel.
Ahmed Mokhallalati, a surgeon  , told Al Jazeera that Israeli forces moved tanks inside the hospital grounds after 'continuous, aggressive gunshots, bombardments and attacks since yesterday evening'.
'Imagine being in a hospital where the water is not there, the basic hygiene of the people going to the toilet is a challenge. Food and drinking water haven't come to the hospital for the sixth day now, with no way of getting anything in the hospital,' Mokhallalati said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement it was 'urgently exploring the possibility for evacuating patients and medical staff" in al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza in discussions with Palestinian Health Minister Mai al-Kaila and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

Israeli forces raid Jenin, surround hospitals in occupied West Bank

A number of hospitals were surrounded and at least five people were killed as Israeli forces launched a major raid on Jenin in the occupied West Bank.
The attacks, launched overnight and lasting into Friday, also left at least 14 others injured, according to Palestinian sources. The raid on the Ibn Sina Hospital has ended after several hours.
The five that died were killed by a drone strike on the Jenin refugee camp. Air strikes have become more regular in the West Bank as the war in Gaza rages.
Emergency services were prevented by Israeli forces from reaching the injured, potentially placing lives at risk, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
From about 10.30pm on Thursday, the Israeli army pushed at least 80 military vehicles into the city of Jenin, raiding Palestinian homes and detaining several people. There were reports of violent clashes.
'Dozens of armoured vehicles turned up, with bulldozers as well, damaging cars, damaging the roads,' reported Al Jazeera's Sara Khairat from occupied East Jerusalem. The raid lasted for about eight hours.
At least four hospitals were surrounded by Israeli soldiers.
'Israeli forces turned up at Ibn Sina Hospital, one of the biggest in the occupied West Bank. They turned up in a raid where they asked medical staff to put their hands up and evacuate the hospital,' Khairat said.
A number of doctors from the hospital refused to comply and evacuate; two paramedics were arrested, she added.
'It is important to note that this happened in Jenin refugee camp where clashes have been intense almost daily But the nature of this particular raid is quite incredible, really. Not just it being a hospital but the way the Israeli forces are coming in,' Khairat continued.
The Israeli military said that it had exchanged fire with Palestinian fighters, who then used ambulances to flee towards Ibn Sina Hospital 'in order to hide there'. One Palestinian fighter was arrested at the entrance of the medical facility, the army said.
Tensions have been high across the West Bank since Israel launched its war on Hamas on October 7, which has killed at least 11,500 people in the Gaza Strip.
Wafa also reported that Israeli forces raided several homes in the town of Ni'lin, west of Ramallah, and arrested at least 28 people on Friday.
On Thursday, three Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli soldiers after opening fire at a checkpoint in the West Bank. One Israeli soldier was killedin the attack, according to Israeli officials.
Al Jazeera's Zein Basravi, reporting from Ramallah in the West Bank,said such attacks using small arms and explosives have increased in recent weeks amid mounting anger over civilian deaths in Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank.
'As Israel continues to turn up the heat, turn up the pressure on Palestinian communities, people are beginning to push back,' he said.
Since October 7, 203 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli raids in the West Bank.

Sport weekly: Football speaks out on the Israel-Hamas war

October 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Welcome to Al Jazeera's Sport Weekly newsletter, which explores the intersection of sport with politics, culture and money. You can sign up  .
For those exhausted by supporting club teams on the slide or stressed by the vagaries of fantasy football, this week brings the more pedestrian pace of an international break.
England face Italy in a Euro 2024 qualifier, Scotland can seal a spot at the tournament if Norway fail to beat Spain, and Euro hosts Germany begin 'das reboot' under new boss Julian Nagelsmann with a friendly against the USA.
Asian teams begin their 2026 World Cup qualification campaigns, with  with some hope after years of war and Pakistan  a three-decade winless record.
But, as so often, politics is overshadowing football; this week's horrific violence between Israel and Hamas, and the soaring civilian death toll is already in the thousands.
UEFA postponed Israel's Euro 2024 qualifiers against Kosovo and Switzerland, while Palestine were unable to travel to Malaysia for a tournament.
Lior Asulin, a former player for Hapoel Tel Aviv, was killed by Hamas fighters at a   in southern Israel. He joins a long list of athletes killed in the conflict – including  , killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank late last year.
Football federations have been urged to speak out on the latest violence, and even take sides, while some fans have been told to shut up.
While FIFA was quick to send condolences to the victims of this week's earthquake in Afghanistan, and decisive in acting when the Russian war in Ukraine began last year, President Gianni Infantino only sent condolences to the Israeli and Palestinian football associations on Friday.
Meanwhile, if the British government and the main opposition had their way, the Wembley arch would be lit in blue and white on Friday for England's friendly against Australia in solidarity with Israel.
The arch was previously lit up in colours of the Turkish, French and Belgian flags after attacks, and in Ukrainian colours after Russia's full-scale invasion.
But while most would join the politicians in condemning Hamas's killing of Israeli civilians, why is there not the same level of concern when the victims are Palestinians killed by Israel, especially as Israel inflicts even more misery on the  ?
The English Football Association eventually decided that a period of silence will be held before the game for "the innocent victims of the devastating events in Israel and Palestine" and that players will wear black armbands. The arch will not be illuminated in any colours.
The UK government issued a rare rebuke to the FA over the decision.
"It is especially disappointing in light of the FA's bold stance on other terrorist attacks in the recent past,' Britain's Secretary for Culture, Media and Sport Lucy Frazer said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
"Words and actions matter. The Government is clear: we stand with Israel".
I am extremely disappointed by the FA's decision not to light up the Wembley Stadium arch following last weekend's horrific terrorist attacks in Israel, and have made my views clear to the FA.
- Lucy Frazer (@lucyfrazermp) October 12, 2023
 
Fans attending the game, meanwhile, are banned by the FA from bringing national flags other than those of England or Australia.
And Home Secretary Suella Braverman said earlier this week that waving a Palestinian flag on streets in the UK 'may not be legitimate' if deemed to be a show of support for 'acts of terrorism'.
This comes amid controversy over a Scottish Premiership game last Saturday, in which  , a Celtic ultras group, waved Palestinian flags and banners saying "Free Palestine" and "Victory to the Resistance".
Many Celtic fans have deep connections to the Palestinian cause. (Across the sectarian divide, fans of Glasgow-pals Rangers can be seen displaying Israeli flags).
Celtic's board subsequently released a statement saying that they wished to "disassociate" from the displays and that 'political messages and banners are not welcome at Celtic Park,' especially at "a time of loss and suffering for many".
The fan group hit back at the "elitist board", insisting in a statement that all fans "have the right to express political views on the terraces just as ordinary citizens do elsewhere in society".
They also questioned the board's stance, since expressions of support for Ukraine were welcome in the stadium after Russia's full-scale invasion.
"Why are Ukrainian lives more sacred than Palestinian lives?" they asked, calling on all Celtic fans to raise the Palestine flag during the club's UEFA Champions League match against Atletico Madrid on October 25.
Meanwhile, there was another reminder this week that football can confound and that stadiums are often the unruliest places in some societies.
Fans at a football match in Tehran chanted for Palestinian flags handed out by the authorities to be shoved somewhere very eye-watering.
'This is a really interesting and often overlooked dynamic in Iranian society compared to what the regime says; extreme anger at being constricted and impoverished whilst huge sums are spent on Hamas and Hezbollah,' journalist  wrote on X.

All of this raises questions. Since there is no clean separation of politics from sport, who gets to speak freely? Whose politics are allowed? Who is football for?
Of course, there should be limits – racism, homophobia, transphobia and other forms of hate speech should not be tolerated in stadiums - and there will be debates over where the lines are and on the timing of statements.
But defending football stadiums as a civil society space – whether for protest, activism, or indeed somewhere to forget the world outside the stadium – free from the burdensome interference of politicians and officials seems vital.
Abdullah Al-Arian, associate professor of history at Georgetown University in Qatar and author of Football in the Middle East, told Al Jazeera this week that football stadiums are among "the last democratic spaces where people come together and express themselves" in a way that is hard to censor, drown out or criminalise.

Israeli lawmaker blames pogroms against Palestinians for 'terrible' attacks

October 8th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
An Israeli lawmaker has told Al Jazeera that his party warned about events like Saturday's Hamas attack on Israel if the country's government continued its illegal occupation of Palestinian lands.
Hamas launched a multipronged assault at dawn on Saturday with thousands of rockets fired at Israel, and the Gaza-based group's fighters infiltrating Israeli towns and illegal settlements.
The attack left at least 300 Israelis dead, including dozens of soldiers, with bodies strewn on roads. Meanwhile, at least 313 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,700 others wounded in Israeli bombardments of the besieged Gaza enclave.
Ofer Cassif, a member of the Knesset and leftist Hadash coalition, said he warned the situation would "erupt" if the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not change its policies towards Palestinians. Hadash has four seats in the 120-member Knesset.
'We condemn and oppose any assault on innocent civilians. But in contrast to the Israeli government that means that we oppose any assault on Palestinian civilians as well. We must analyse those terrible incidents [the attacks] in the right context – and that is the ongoing occupation," Cassif said.
"We have been warning time and time again everything is going to erupt and everybody is going to pay a price – mainly innocent civilians on both sides. And unfortunately, that is exactly what happened," he said.
"The Israeli government, which is a fascist government, supports, encourages, and leads pogroms against the Palestinians. There is an ethnic cleansing going on. It was obvious the writing was on the wall, written in the blood of the Palestinians – and unfortunately now Israelis as well," he added.
More than 20,000 Palestinians have left Gaza's border region to head further inside the Hamas-controlled territory to seek refuge in UN schools, according to UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.
Previously, conflicts between Israel and Hamas resulted in extensive devastation in Gaza and days of rocket attacks on Israeli towns. The current escalation appears to be even more precarious than normal, as Israel's far-right government grapples with the unprecedented security breach, while Palestinians are mired in despair due to the ongoing occupation in the West Bank and the suffocating blockade in Gaza.
"The only thing Netanyahu cares about is not the well-being of the citizens of Israel, let alone of Palestinians in the occupied territories," Cassif said. " He is interested in surviving. He just wants to stay out of prison. That is the only motivation and incentive that drives [him].'
Netanyahu is facing numerous   at home with the country's attorney general filing several charges against him, including fraud, breach of trust, and corruption. The Israeli leader has strongly denied the charges.
The latest escalation   the prospect of a broader regional conflict. On Sunday, Hezbollah, a powerful armed group backed by Iran, said it had launched guided rockets and artillery onto three posts in Shebaa Farms 'in solidarity' with the Palestinian people.
Shebaa Farms, which is claimed by Lebanon, was captured by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War.
The Israeli military said on Sunday it fired artillery into an area of Lebanon from where cross-border mortar fire was launched. Israel's military said one of its drones struck a Hezbollah post in the area of Har Dov, an area in Shebaa Farms.
"I'm afraid that some of the elements like Hezbollah are going to join this war. I hope not, of course. Indeed, for the sake of all people, of all civilians, Palestinians and Israelis alike, I hope that that this is going to end as soon as possible," Cassif said, adding that "the only way to stop the bloodshed of both peoples is to put an end to the occupation".
On Sunday, an Egyptian policeman   on tourists in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, killing at least two Israeli nationals and one Egyptian, according to local media reports.
Extra News television channel, which has close ties to Egyptian security agencies, quoted an unidentified security official as saying that another person was wounded in the attack at an Israeli tour group in Pompey's Pillar site in Alexandria.
'This morning during a visit of Israeli tourists in Alexandria, Egypt, a local opened fire at them, murdering two Israeli citizens and their Egyptian guide," Israel's foreign ministry said in a statement.

Thousands of Iranians held rallies across the country against  , with a top military commander warning that Israel was heading for a long and bloody war with Palestinian group Hamas.
The demonstrations on Saturday in the capital Tehran and other cities were held in "support of the oppressed children of Gaza" under the slogan "Palestine is not alone", according to local media.
Israel's air and ground campaign has killed an estimated 12,000 people in the Palestinian territory, including 5,000 children, according to Palestinian authorities.
Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas in response to the group's   which Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and in which about  .
"Palestine stands on the path of a war of attrition … Israel will face a definitive defeat and end up in the dustbin of history," Commander Hossein Salami from the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told the rally in Tehran, which was aired live on state TV.
"The battle is not over. The Islamic world will do whatever it has to do. There are still great [unused] capacities left," Salami said, without referring to any possible moves by Iran to join the conflict.
"The Zionist regime [Israel] can no longer see peace and security. Muslims will take revenge on behalf of the oppressed people of Gaza, and this revenge has no expiration date."
In Tehran, demonstrators waved Palestinian flags, while others held banners that read, "Down with America" and "Down with Israel", according to the AFP news agency.
Others set alight Israeli flags, while some waved the flags of Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah, Iran's ally, which has been engaged in   since October 7.
State television also showed some protesters carrying bundled white shrouds symbolising the children killed in Gaza, during the marches held in advance of World Children's Day on Monday.

Similar demonstrations took place in other major cities including Shiraz, Kerman and Isfahan.
Earlier this week, hundreds of body bags were laid out in Palestine Square in Tehran to protest against the continuing Israeli offensive on Gaza.
Iran has made support for the Palestinian cause a centrepiece of its foreign policy since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Iran, which supports Hamas financially and militarily, has hailed the October 7 attacks a "success" but denied any involvement.
It has also lambasted Israel's bombardment of Gaza as "genocide" while denouncing the United States over its support for Israel.
On Saturday, Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanani decried Israel's "attacks" on  .
"Attacking hospitals is in conflict with all human rights standards, international law and Geneva Conventions and makes the criminal nature of this regime even more obvious to the world," he said on X.
His statement came as hundreds of people fled Gaza's main al-Shifa Hospital, where more than 2,000 patients, medics and displaced people were trapped.
Israel has been pressing military operations inside the hospital, searching for a Hamas operations centre it claims lies under the sprawling complex – a charge Hamas has denied.

Palestinian Authority President Abbas fires occupied West Bank governors

August 11th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas has fired most of the governors in the occupied West Bank, responding to long-standing demands for a political shake-up amid growing frustration.
Abbas issued a decree on Thursday dismissing the governors of eight provinces under Palestinian administration in the occupied territory. The upheaval included the northern cities of Nablus, Jenin and Tulkarem, the focus of a recent surge in Palestinian armed resistance that has undermined the PA's leadership. The governors of Qalqilya, Tulkarem, Bethlehem, Hebron, Tubas and Jericho were also removed.
Abbas's decree also fired four governors in the besieged Gaza Strip, whose role has remained symbolic since the 2007 Hamas takeover of the enclave.
Only three areas – including Ramallah, the seat of the internationally recognised PA – retained their governors. The president's office said that he would form a committee to suggest replacements.
A number of the sacked governors said they found out about their dismissal from local media.
"I was not previously informed of the referral for retirement, and I learned about the decision from the media," Akram Rajoub, the previous governor of Jenin told Quds News Network.
Others, like the former governor of Jericho Jihad Abu al-Asal, said while he and his colleagues had expected an overhaul for years given growing demands for change, Thursday's decree still took them by surprise.
"No one spoke to us," he said. "We do not know what the reasons are, and we were surprised to learn about it from the media."
Yet none expressed dissent with the decision of the president, with al-Asal saying: "Even if we don't understand all the reasons for it, we will comply."
'It will take much more'
Although the decision is unlikely to have an immediate impact on the ground, experts said it signals Abbas's recognition of the PA's deepening unpopularity and his desire to show that he is heeding calls for change.
"It gives the authority a new face, which is important particularly as the governors are in charge of all security matters," said political analyst Jehad Harb. "But it won't change anything really. [Abbas] is trying to rebuild some public trust, but it will take much more."
The move comes as the secular nationalist Fatah party, which runs the PA, grapples with mounting crises – internal and otherwise.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government has imposed numerous sanctions on the PA, expanded settlements on Palestinian lands, and overseen Israeli military raids into occupied West Bank cities that Palestinian officials say weaken their control.
Powerful ministers in Netanyahu's government have openly called for the collapse of the PA and the annexation of the occupied West Bank. These policies have been accompanied by a surge in vigilante settler violence against Palestinians.
On Friday, yet another Israeli raid on a Palestinian refugee camp resulted in the killing of a 23-year-old man.
Mahmoud Jarad was shot in the chest as Israeli soldiers   the Tulkarem refugee camp in the northern occupied West Bank.
At least 220 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli occupation forces since the beginning of 2023, according to Palestinian officials, in what the United Nations said was the deadliest year since it began recording fatalities at the end of the Second Intifada. At least 27 Israelis have been killed in separate attacks during the same period.

Here is   on Thursday, October 26, 2023:
Latest developments
Israeli air raids killed   of Al Jazeera Arabic's Gaza bureau chief, Wael Dahdouh, on Wednesday.
Israel's Army Radio said it carried out a "relatively large" ground incursion into Gaza overnight. The army claimed it killed "many' fighters, and destroyed military infrastructure and antitank positions.
Competing   resolutions on the Israel-Gaza war have failed to pass the United Nations Security Council, either due to vetoes from permanent members, or insufficient votes in favour. Frustration between member states seems to be growing over   on principles of self-defence and navigating humanitarian assistance.
Air attacks in Khan Younis have killed at least 18 people and injured several others, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa.
Human impact and fighting
US President Joe Biden is receiving backlash from American Muslims for questioning the accuracy of the Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which has now crossed 6,500. The Israel and Palestine director of Human Rights Watch responded, saying the death toll is reliable.
Israeli bombardment on Palestinian journalist Duaa Sharaf's house killed Sharaf and her child in the early hours of Thursday, according to Wafa.
Israel's military said on Wednesday that it intercepted a surface-to-air missile fired from Lebanon towards an army drone.
Overnight strikes across Tal al-Hawa in the south ignited a huge fire.
With 130   of incubators shutting down, ICUs in Gaza no longer have water for some of them, according to Dr Mohammed Qandeel from Nasser Hospital.
An Oxfam   says starvation is being used as a "weapon of war" in Gaza.
(Al Jazeera)
Diplomacy
A summit of European Union leaders on Thursday will call for a "humanitarian pause" in Israel's war on Gaza.
In the US House of Representatives, a pro-Israel resolution brought to the floor by Speaker Mike Johnson passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.
Biden called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discussed a 'pathway for a permanent peace". The two leaders have been holding regular phone calls and discussing urgent safe passage for foreign nationals wishing to leave Gaza, according to the White House.
Japan's Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa met the Israeli ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen. The minister called for fighting to be temporarily suspended in Gaza and for more humanitarian assistance to be delivered to the enclave.
UN Chief Antonio Guterres said his comments at the UNSC debate have been misinterpreted as "justifying acts of terror by Hamas".
Escalation in the occupied West Bank
Ramping up overnight raids in the West Bank, Israeli forces have arrested more than 1,200 Palestinians across the occupied territory since October 7.
Armoured Israeli vehicles are again patrolling Nablus and Hebron overnight.
Reporting from Ramallah, Al Jazeera correspondent Charles Stratford said arrest attempts in Hebron seem to be focusing on female activists, including university students and a "well-known writer and political analyst".

Who are Israeli settlers, and why do they live on Palestinian lands?

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Since Israel unleashed its brutal bombing campaign in Gaza on October 7 in the wake of a deadly Hamas attack, settler attacks against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem have more than doubled from an average of three to eight incidents a day, according to the United Nations.
The spike in settler attacks have forced hundreds of Palestinians to flee their homes in the past three weeks amid the Israeli bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 9,500 people.
So, who are the settlers and where do they live?
Who are the settlers?
Settlers are Israeli citizens who live on private  in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The vast majority of the settlements have been built either entirely or partially on private Palestinian land.
More than 700,000 settlers – 10 percent of Israel's nearly 7 million population – now live in 150 settlements and 128 outposts dotting the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
A settlement is authorised by the Israeli government while an outpost is built without government authorisation. Outposts can range from a small shanty of a few people to a community of up to 400 people.
Some of the settlers move to the occupied territories for religious reasons while others are drawn by a relatively lower cost of living and financial incentives offered by the government. Ultraorthodox Jews form one-third of all settlers.
A majority of Israeli Jews who live in the West Bank say that the construction of settlements improves the security of the country, according to the Pew Research Center. The argument is that settlements act as a buffer for Israel's national security as they restrict the movement of Palestinians and undermine the viability of a Palestinian state. However, some on the Israeli left argue that the settlement expansion hurts the two-state solution and thereby Israel's own prospects for peace.
(Al Jazeera)
When were the first settlements built?
Israel started building settlements just after capturing the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the June 1967 Six-Day War.
In September 1967, the Etzion Bloc in Hebron was the first settlement built in the occupied West Bank. The settlement now hosts 40,000 people.
Kfar Etzion, one of the oldest settlements, houses around 1,000 people while the largest – Modi'in Illit – has around 82,000 settlers, most of them ultraorthodox Jews.
Successive Israeli governments have pursued this policy leading to a rise in settler population in the occupied territories.
About 40 percent of the occupied West Bank land is now controlled by settlements. These settlements — along with a vast network of checkpoints for Palestinians — effectively separate the Palestinian parts of the West Bank from each other, making the prospect of a future contiguous state almost impossible, according to critics.
The first Jewish settlement in Palestine goes back to the early 20th century when Jews facing widespread discrimination, religious persecution and pogroms in Europe started to arrive. Back then Palestine – which was still under British colonial control - was overwhelmingly Arab with a tiny Jewish minority.
Tel Aviv, Israel's largest city, was built as a settlement in the suburb of the Arab city of Jaffa in 1909.
The mass migration of Jews to Palestine triggered an Arab uprising. But in the ensuing violence, the well-armed Zionist militias ethnically cleansed 750,000 Palestinians in 1948. Palestinians call their expulsion the Nakba, which is Arabic for catastrophe.
Are settlers backed by the government?
The Israeli government has openly   settlements for Jews to live there.
The Israeli authorities give its settlers in the West Bank some 20 million shekels ($5m) a year to monitor, report and restrict Palestinian construction in Area C, which is over 60 percent of the West Bank. The money is used to hire inspectors and buy drones, aerial imagery, tablets and vehicles among other things.
On April 4, Israeli authorities asked to double that amount in the state budget, to 40 million shekels ($10m).
Over the past few years, the Israeli army has been operating a hotline it calls War Room C, for settlers to call and report  Palestinian construction in Area C.
Several Israeli laws enable settlers to seize Palestinian land:
Israel has declared about 26 percent of the West Bank's territory  as "state land," on which settlements can be built.
Israel has used legal means to expropriate Palestinian property for public needs such as roads, settlements and parks.
After the signing of the 1993 Oslo Accords with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), the Israeli government officially stopped building new settlements but the existing settlements continued to grow.
The settlement population in the West Bank and East Jerusalem grew  from approximately 250,000 in 1993 to nearly 700,000 in September this year.
But in 2017, Israel formally announced the start of new settlements.
Prime Minister Netanyahu - Israel's longest-serving prime minister - has bolstered settlement expansions since he first came to power in 1996.
There are also Israeli "nongovernmental" organisations that work to evict Palestinians from their land using loopholes in the land laws.
Israeli authorities also regularly seize and demolish Palestinian properties citing the lack of Israeli-issued building permits and land documents.
But international rights groups say acquiring an Israeli building permit is nearly impossible.
Are Israeli settlements legal under international law?
No.All settlements and outposts are considered illegal under international laws as they violate the Fourth Geneva Convention, which bans an occupying power from transferring its population to the area it occupies.
Settlements, activists say, are enclaves of Israeli sovereignty that have fragmented the occupied West Bank, and any future Palestinian state would look like a series of tiny, unconnected South Africa's former Bantustans, or black-only townships.
The United Nations has condemned them through multiple resolutions and votes. In 2016, a United Nations Security Council resolution said  settlements had "no legal validity".
But the US, Israel's closest ally, has provided diplomatic cover over the years. Washington has consistently used its  at the UN to protect Israel from diplomatic censure.
Israel authorises and encourages settlements. Though it deems outposts as illegal under its laws, Israel has in recent years retrospectively legalised several outposts.
More than 9,000 settlers withdrew from Gaza in 2005 when Israel dismantled settlements as a part of a 'disengagement' plan by former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
How does Israel keep control of the West Bank?
Israel has built a wall or   that stretches for more than 700km (435 miles) through the West Bank restricting movement of more than 3 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. But Israel says the wall is for security purposes.
Palestinian farmers need to apply for permits to access their own land. These permits need to be renewed repeatedly and can also be denied or revoked without explanation.
For instance, about 270 of the entire 291 hectares that belong to the Palestinian village of  near Bethlehem are designated as Area C, which is under Israeli control. About 60 percent of the occupied West Bank falls under Area C.
Besides the separation wall, over 700 road obstacles are placed across the West Bank including 140 checkpoints. About 70,000 Palestinians with Israeli work permits cross these checkpoints in their daily commute.
Palestinians cannot move freely between the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, and require permits to do so.
Rights groups such as Human Rights Watch and B'Tselem have concluded that Israeli policies and laws used to dominate Palestinian people can be described as " apartheid ".
Has settler violence spiked in recent weeks?
Yes. Settlers have carried out more than 198 attacks in the West Bank forcing around 1,000 Palestinians to flee their homes as Israel has continued its relentless bombardment of Gaza, since October 7.
"Settlers have been committing crimes in the occupied West Bank well before October 7. It is as though, however, they got a green light after October 7 to carry out more crimes," Ghassan Daghlas, a   official monitoring settler activity told Al Jazeera.
On October 28, a Palestinian farmer harvesting olives was   by settlers in the occupied West Bank city of Nablus."We are now during the olive harvest season - people have not been able to reach 60 percent of olive trees in the Nablus area because of settler attacks," said Daghlas.
Bedouin village of Wadi as-Seeq village in the occupied West Bank was emptied out of its 200 residents on October 12 following threats from settlers.
The current violence comes as last year saw record settler violence, risingfrom an average of three to eight incidents a day, according to theUnited Nations.
In recent years settlers have increasingly been trying to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound raising Palestinian concerns that they want to encroach upon Islam's third holiest site. Jewish prayers are not allowed as per 'status quo' governing the Al-Aqsa.
Three days before Hamas carried out a deadly attack inside Israel, settlers   the mosque compound. In 2021, Israeli police stormed the mosque compound to facilitate the entry of settlers, triggering a deadly conflict.
In February, far-right settlers went on a rampage in the West Bank town of Huwara torching dozens of houses and cars. Following the violence, Israeli Finance Minister BezalelSmotrich called for Huwara to be 'wiped out'.
Israeli settler violence has displaced more than 1,100 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since 2022, according to a UN report released in September 2023.

Israel and Palestine: Is war the only way out?

October 28th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The boy  , wide-eyed and covered in ash and debris. Once a doctor embraces him, the boy, whose name is Muhammed Abu Louli, and who just survived an Israeli air strike on the Gaza Strip, scrunches his terrified face and lets out a long wail.
On another evening in the besieged territory, veteran Al Jazeera journalist Wael Dahdouh is live on air when he gets the news: An Israeli strike has  , including his wife, son, daughter and grandchild.
Throughout Gaza, doctors   in the blockaded enclave's crumbling hospitals, passing out in shock when they see their own maimed, bloodied family members among the deceased.
And   in the southern part of the strip, shelters for those fleeing Israel's indiscriminate bombing, with Palestinians saying the sight is eerie, reminiscent of the Nakba in 1948 when many were forced to leave their homes during Israel's founding.
These are the scenes in Gaza for weeks now as Israel's retaliatory attack following Hamas's incursion onto Israeli soil on October 7 runs into its fourth week.
The casualties are mounting heavy, with the death toll in Gaza  , many of them children. Israel has been   and carrying out   to set the board for a larger ground offensive on the impoverished enclave.
But is war the only way this will play out? Or are there other options?
The short answer: A longer, more enduring war exacted through a ground invasion is still very much in the cards. Mediating the end of the conflict through diplomacy is also a possibility, but one studded with a number of thorny issues centred on the hegemony of Western power. A third and most extreme scenario would be the reoccupation of the Gaza Strip – or the expulsion of Palestinians from the territory entirely.

The 'bloodiest type of warfare'
It would be like the battles of Stalingrad, Grozny or Mariupol.
The deadly, drawn-out sieges in the 1940s Soviet Union, 1990s Chechnya, and last year in Ukraine, respectively, are the closest examples of what a ground invasion of Gaza would look like, according to Zoran Kusovac, a strategic analyst and consultant.
That scenario would mean a prolonged war – which some analysts believe is exactly whatIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants.
Netanyahu's desire for a protracted conflict is to deflect from the years-long corruption cases he faces, as well as the weekly protests against his government's overhaul of Israel's judicial system, said Haim Bresheeth, a professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London and author of An Army Like No Other: How the Israel Defense Forces Made a Nation.
'He wants it to be very long [so that he doesn't] go to jail. And after the war, who will have the energy to put him into jail?' Bresheeth told Al Jazeera, saying that Netanyahu also wants to prevail as 'the hero destroying Hamas'.
'He's not concerned about the people who were killed by the attackers on the seventh of October. And he's not concerned about the prisoners of war.'
But a prolonged war involving a total ground invasion of Gaza would be akin to urban warfare, the bloodiest type of warfare, said Kusovac.
'Urban warfare in Gaza would be horrendous in terms of civilian casualties,' he told Al Jazeera.
If such a ground invasion was to occur, it would likely begin at night, as Israeli forces have an advantage in night training, Kusovac said.
But Gaza is also well-defended with its network of tunnels, which Hamas knows inside and out, and which could be planted with mines should the Israelis try to penetrate them, he said.
Still, Israel is equipped with sophisticated technology like robots that could enter these tunnels, Kusovac said, which aren't only Hamas outposts, but also how some food and other vital supplies enter the blockaded territory.
The scale of this conflict is already different, when compared with past Israeli assaults on Gaza and the disproportionate amount of military use against Palestinians, said Loreley Hahn Herrera, a lecturer at SOAS's Centre for Palestine Studies.
The response to Hamas's attack has been a 'real act of vengeance from Israel', she said.
'It's really [an] offensive based on carpet bombing Gaza,' Herrera told Al Jazeera.
Zachary Foster, a historian of Palestine and a doctoral alumnus from Princeton University, said the scale of violence against Palestinians when compared with previous deadly assaults against Gaza in 2008 and 2014 is staggering.
In 2008, 1,385 Palestinians were killed over 22 days, while in 2014 Israel's 50-day bombardment killed 2,251 Palestinians, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
In the five days following October 7, Israel   on the densely populated territory, more than it did in 50 days in 2014. Gaza's death toll as a result 20 days into the current conflict is numerous times higher than in the past.
Previously, Israel targeted specific buildings that left surrounding ones intact, whereas now Israel has been levelling entire streets and neighbourhoods to the ground, Foster said.
'[There's] no attempt whatsoever to distinguish between military and civilian personnel,' he told Al Jazeera.
A total siege on Gaza through the cutting off of food, water and electricity lasting as long as it has in this conflict is also fundamentally new, Foster said.
The historian is also keeping a record of Israeli politicians and pundits who have expressed 'genocidal intent' since the events of October 7 – also unprecedented, he said, with his list naming 24 people  as of October 20.

Diplomacy: Now or 'after another 5,000 dead civilians'?
Still, Foster said that each day that passes that Israel chooses not to pursue a ground invasion makes it less likely that it will.
A protracted war would lead to huge Israeli military personnel losses and could widen the scope of the war with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in a much more serious way, which Israel will want to avoid, he said.
Additionally, Hamas would be ready to engage in guerilla warfare, through its use of its 'booby-trapped' tunnels, 'a nightmare scenario' for Israel, Foster added.
A diplomatic solution is, therefore, the sole way the conflict will progress, he argued.
'I think it's the only way it will play out,' he said. 'The only question is, will the diplomatic solution come now? Or will it come after another 500 or 5,000 dead civilians?'
In order for both sides to come to the negotiating table, they will each have to make compromises, Foster said.
Israel will likely demand a release of the   on October 7 and a cessation of rocket attacks, while Hamas will urge for a loosening of the blockade on Gaza and a cessation of bombing on civilian areas, he said.
But the road to diplomacy appears lengthy.
Arab countries' normalisation with Israel in recent years has prevented stronger condemnations of Israel's actions in Gaza, which is thereby hindering a possible diplomatic solution and risks escalating the crisis throughout the region, said the analysts.
Arab leaders should be held accountable for abandoning the Palestinian cause, Herrera said.
There's been limited success in the international arena as well, with the UN Security Council unable to pass resolutions for a ceasefire due to  .
US President Joe Biden's militaristic approach to foreign policy is to blame, along with Europe trailing in the lead of an 'American agenda', argued Bresheeth.
'Biden is a conflictual politician who is opposed to discussing any other [solutions] than military attacks,' he said, adding that the US is likely seeing this war as a profiteering one, an opportunity to sell more arms.
'The forces that want a peaceful solution are all countries that don't have enough sway in the UN,' Bresheeth added.
Western leaders, meanwhile, have paid visits to Israel and been unequivocal in their support for the country's "right to defend itself".
'Impossible to have a land without a people'
A third possible scenario could change the entire makeup of the Gaza Strip, either through Israeli reoccupation of the territory, or the expulsion of all Palestinians there.
'I think the interest of Israel reoccupying the territory of the Gaza Strip, basically comes down to Israel's aims since the 1940s, [since the] establishment of the State of Israel, which is to have the most amount of land with the least amount of Palestinians,' said Herrera, arguing that it's part of Israel's mission to 'complete the ethnic cleansing of Palestine'.
Additionally, Israel's evacuation orders for Palestinians to move south of the strip near the border crossing with Egypt, while it continues to bomb the southern sector and the crossing itself, 'really speaks to them wanting to expel Palestinians once more, and take most of the land', she added.
But Palestinians have been resistant to the idea of evacuating the Strip, with families who had left for the south also   in the northern parts of Gaza, preferring instead to die in their homes as Israeli bombardment continues unabated.
Anis Mohsen, the editorial director of the Institute for Palestine Studies' Arabic-language journal, spoke to a friend in Gaza who is one among many who has returned from the south of the Strip.
His friend's resolve to move south changed after strikes hit places of refuge there, like hospitals and churches, he said.
'Impossible to have a land without a people, so people should stay in their land,' is the sentiment among Palestinians, Mohsen told Al Jazeera.

Further, Egypt has refuted the idea of allowing Palestinians to move into its Sinai territory, stating it will lead to  .
According to Kusovac, clearing Gaza entirely is still an extreme right-wing idea among Israel's public – but one that has been gaining ground in the last few weeks.
And it's consistent with Netanyahu's thinking: if carried out, there would be no more Hamas, no more rockets, while the Israeli prime minister would emerge as the country's saviour, able to offer a razed-down Gaza as territory for more Israeli settlements, he explained.
Lessons from history
In whichever way the conflict will progress, Palestinians in Gaza will be worse off than ever before, argued Foster.
'The key lesson to learn from the past five wars fought between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is that you can expect the innocent people of Gaza will be forgotten,' he said.
The blockade is not likely to be loosened, the vast majority of people will remain dependent on food handouts, there will be electricity shortages and people will continue to suffer from multiple public health crises, he said.
'I think what history teaches us is that the world has basically forgotten the people in Gaza and [have deemed] them to a life living in an open-air prison,' Foster said.
But a changing public discourse in the West on the plight of Palestinians is also gaining ground, said Herrera, as the daily realities of war are captured online by Palestinians themselves.
And at the end of the day, there will be no real winners, suggestedBresheeth.
'Nothing good can come out of this situation, and the people responsible are not just the Israelis, but also their paymasters and supporters in the West, who are egging them on to this genocide,' he said.

Hamas releases 11 more captives from Gaza, Israeli army says

The Israeli military says 11 hostages have been released by the Palestinian armed group Hamas and are on their way to Israel, the latest in a   during a four-day humanitarian pause.
"Based on information that was received from the Red Cross, 11 hostages are currently on their way to Israeli territory," the Israeli military said in a statement on Monday.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, which has played a key role in  , said those released were six Argentinians, three French citizens and two Germans.
The release of the hostages, some of the roughly 240 people taken captive by Hamas in deadly attacks on southern Israel on October 7, comes after Qatar and Hamas said that an agreement has been reached   the initial four-day truce.
Qatar's Foreign Ministry said on Monday that Israel and Hamas had reached a deal to extend their truce for an additional two days, offering much-needed respite for Palestinians in Gaza, who have been exhausted by weeks of relentless Israeli bombardment, and hope for Israelis with loved ones held captive who they hope to see  .
Over the past several days, Palestinian groups in Gaza have released captives in exchange for the release of Palestinians held in  , many of whom are women and children who have been held without trial.
On Sunday, Hamas released 17 more captives – 14 Israelis and three Thais – the highest number so far. The total number of captives released since fighting began on October 7 now stands at 62, most of them since the temporary pause in the fighting began on Friday.
Israel has said that it will extend the truce by one day for every 10 hostages released, and Hamas has said it has agreed to an extended truce under 'the same terms' as the original deal.
The pause in fighting has also allowed for increased shipments of   into the Gaza Strip, where a relentless Israeli assault and siege of the territory has created a dire humanitarian crisis.

Pro-Palestinian or following trends? China's stance on war spilts analysts

When Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a ceasefire and an end to the 'collective punishment' of the people of Gaza on the sidelines of the BRICS summit this week, his comments added to a steady drum beat of criticism of Israel since the start of its war with Hamas.
"It is necessary to ensure the safe and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance and stop the collective punishment against the people of Gaza through forced eviction, as well as turning off water, electricity and oil," Xi said on Tuesday via video link at the summit hosted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.
China's initial response to the conflict was cautious and equivocal in apportioning blame.
Beijing waited until a day after Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel to call on the 'relevant parties' to end hostilities and stress the need for a two-state solution, and did not condemn the Palestinian armed group or mention it by name.
But within a week of the attack, Chinese diplomats began to call Israel's bombardment of Gaza a form of collective punishment and insist that the country's right to self-defence should be guided by international law and not come at the expense of innocent civilians.
Since then, Beijing has called for multilateral and peaceful solutions to the conflict of the kind promoted by the United Nations, where Beijing took the helm of the powerful Security Council earlier this month.
China, which has expressed its desire to be a peace broker in the Middle East, this week welcomed the announcement of the four-day truce between Israel and Hamas that took effect on Friday.
Chinese state media was quick to claim credit on Beijing's behalf, with the state-run Global Times saying the ceasefire could be attributed to multiple factors including "the latest UN Security Council resolution adopted under China's rotating presidency" and "the strong voice of the Global South."
China's stance on the war is a matter of contention among analysts.
While some see a clear pro-Palestinian through-line in Beijing's foreign policy, others argue it is simply mirroring a global balance of opinion that is increasingly critical of Israel's bombing campaign.
Before the war, China maintained friendly relations with both Israel and the Palestinians.
During the Mao Zedong era in the 1960s, Beijing viewed the Palestinian cause as part of the global campaign against imperialism and armed factions of the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
China now buys large quantities of oil from Iran, one of Hamas's main patrons, and key broker Qatar, as well as other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia.
Under Xi, China's comments about the war have been fairly consistent with past statements about Gaza made in 2008, 2014, and 2021, according to The China Project , typically calling for an end to violence and a mediated resolution.
In 2008, for instance, former top diplomat Qin Gang called for an end to 'actions that cause injuries and deaths to ordinary people' and for all parties to 'exercise maximum restraint and to settle differences through dialogue'.
Still, there have been noticeable shifts in Beijing's rhetoric towards statements that are more critical of Israel, said Benjamin Ho Tse Ern, an assistant professor at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies' (RSIS) China programme, such as its statement that the country had 'gone beyond self-defence'.
Ahmed Aboudouh, an associate fellow at Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa Program, said in a recent commentary that China was clearly signalling its support of the Palestinian side.
'The rhetoric from Beijing is carefully designed to focus on the broader context, such as implementing the two-state solution, addressing humanitarian issues and preventing the conflict from turning into a regional one,' Aboudouh wrote in a commentary on Chatham House's website in October.
'It has refrained from describing the Hamas incursion into Israel as a terrorist attack but has called Israel's retaliation 'collective punishment' of Palestinian civilians - signalling its opposition to an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza.'
Manoj Kewalramani, a foreign policy analyst for the Bangalore-based Takshashila institution, China's statements during the most recent conflict have shown a distinct pro-Palestine bent.
'Since [October 8], Beijing has been critical of Israel's actions, warning about violations of humanitarian law and against 'collective punishment. It has consistently called for a ceasefire, the need to avoid a spill-over of the conflict and the need to host a broader peace conference with a clear roadmap for a two-state solution,' Kewalramani said.
China has also not shied away from positively expressing its support for Palestinians.
Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a group of visiting diplomats from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Indonesia that China was a 'good friend and brother of Arab and Muslim countries' and a firm supporter 'of the cause of the Palestinian people.'
However, Hongda Fan, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, rejected the notion that Beijing is 'biased against Israel.'
Fan said Beijing's position simply reflects the balance of global public opinion amid mounting civilian casualties in Gaza, where at least 14,532 have been killed, according to Palestinian health authorities.
'The 'two-state solution' has not yet gained universal acceptance in Israel. In addition, China's relations with Arab countries and Iran have been developing relatively smoothly in recent years. These factors combine to make China appear to be siding with Palestine. Not really,' he said.
'And overall, international public opinion is becoming increasingly unfavourable to Israel, which also shows that China's position is not biased against Israel,' he said.
RISIS's Ho said the conflict has helped China score points against the United States, its main competitor, which is Israel's biggest ally and backer.
As US officials travelled through the region in October and November, Chinese diplomats did the same, visiting countries including Qatar, Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, while also meeting with Israeli representatives in Beijing.
'Since US policies seem to be more aligned with Israel, it is not surprising that China tends to align with Palestine, which is also viewed as the underdog,' Ho told Al Jazeera.
'This reflects China's 'underdog diplomacy' and that it wants to be seen as on the side – or at least, demonstrating support for – states that are being ostracised by the West.'

Lebanon fears regional war as Hezbollah-Israel fighting intensifies

There is growing fear in Lebanon that fighting between the armed group Hezbollah and Israel could spiral out of control, even as many residents sympathise with the Palestinians under bombardment in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war.
In recent days, the Lebanese armed group and Israel have   deeper into each other's territory, an escalation from previous skirmishes confined to the Israel-Lebanon border region.
The attacks mainly target military outposts and fighters, although there have been a handful of civilian casualties.
Most Lebanese villages in the crossfire have been  , with many fleeing to Hezbollah's stronghold in the suburbs of the capital Beirut. That area remains safe, for now.
'I really hope that an all-out war doesn't start because then it will never stop,' said Elie Khoury, 30, from his phone shop in Beirut. 'We won't be able to handle it [economically]. We don't even have enough medications and there is a shortage of needles in the hospitals.'
An online petition , which has already 8,939 signatures, has called on the Lebanese government not to get dragged into the war. It warns that Lebanon could otherwise be turned into another 'battleground for proxy wars' fought by foreign powers.
Some residents, however, told Al Jazeera that they would support Lebanon taking a more aggressive posture, citing the high death toll from Israel's attacks on Gaza.
More than   have been killed in the ongoing Israel bombardment, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Of that figure, 3,195 were children. That's higher than the total number of children killed in conflict zones across the world  , according to the nongovernment organisation Save the Children.
'The Israelis are killing children. What's happening in Gaza is not a war. It's a massacre,' said Jack Topalian, who runs a coffee stand in Beirut. 'How can we just keep silent?'

'A steady pattern'
  have thus far avoided hitting large urban centres in each other's territories and causing acute civilian casualties, two precautions required under international humanitarian law.
'Both have evacuated villages in order to limit the human death toll,' said Randa Slim, a Lebanese expert with the Middle East Institute.
Nevertheless, she noted that the uptick in violence is worrisome. Hezbollah has claimed to have lost 50 fighters in the fighting, and Israel said six of its soldiers have also died.
'We are seeing the escalation going steadily up every few days. It is a steady pattern,' Slim said. 'The trend is telling but so far, it doesn't appear to be out of control.'
Meanwhile, Palestinian fighters based in Lebanon have also stepped up their attacks.
On October 29, the Palestinian group Hamas said its fighters fired rockets from Lebanon, while another Palestinian armed group claimed responsibility for launching explosives into northern Israel as well.
The involvement of Palestinian fighters allows Hezbollah to claim plausible deniability if its forces cross Israel's 'red lines' such as killing civilians or attacking inhabited towns, said Slim.
But those Palestinian-led attacks are the source of tension in Lebanon. Groups like the Palestinian Liberation Organization played a prominent role in Lebanon's   before they were expelled in 1982. The presence of other Palestinian fighters remains controversial.
'It is a calculated risk on [Hezbollah's] part,' Slim said of the group's loose collaboration with Palestinian fighters, 'because for the majority of Lebanon, it brings back bad memories'.

Political paralysis
Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati told the news outlet AFP on Monday that he is working to avoid a war despite the escalation on his southern border.
'[The] Lebanese have had enough of wars,' he said.
He added that Hezbollah — a much more powerful force than the Lebanese national army — has managed the situation 'rationally and wisely'. But he expressed fear that Lebanon could slide into the war, sparking a wider regional conflict.
'Chaos could engulf the entire Middle East,' he warned.
 , leader of Lebanon's Druze minority group, also said that the 'fate of Lebanon is at stake' and that the country's leaders are advising Hezbollah not to escalate its attacks.
Neither leader, however, has sway over Hezbollah, which is regionally backed by Iran.
Hassan Nasrallah, who is the secretary-general of Hezbollah, is expected to make a speech on Friday about the group's fight with Israel and Israel's ongoing bombardment of Gaza. His words could shape the fate of the country and the region.
'The Israelis are unable to advance in Lebanon by land. But we still must be careful and monitor the situation until Nasrallah speaks,' said Qassem Kassir, a Lebanese commentator close to Hezbollah.
A Lebanese MP, who spoke to Al Jazeera anonymously given the sensitivity of the situation, said that it would be a disaster if Lebanon were to enter into a wider conflict with Israel given its  , lack of social cohesion and  .
Lebanon's parliament has thus far been   a successor to former President Michel Aoun, who  .
The MP added that discussions in parliament mostly revolve around rallying support for Palestinians in Gaza and making emergency preparations in the event of an all-out war.
'We should have a clear position to stop the war in Gaza, to be [in support] of the Palestinian people and to take a stand,' he told Al Jazeera. 'But the situation in Lebanon is also dangerous and we are keen to de-escalate.'

At least five killed in Israeli raids in occupied West Bank: Ministry

At least five people have been killed by Israeli fire as the Israeli army carried out a number of overnight raids in the occupied West Bank, according to Palestinian officials.
The Palestinian health ministry said three people were killed early on Wednesday in an Israeli air attack on the Jenin refugee camp. Two more young people were killed during raids in Qalqilya and Qalandiya, respectively, it added.
The Israeli military said on Wednesday that a group of Palestinians at the camp "fired and hurled explosive devices" at its forces when they were carrying out "counterterrorism activities". The army hit them with a drone, it said, without mentioning casualties.
Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Ramallah, said Israeli forces went into Jenin "with military-grade bulldozers that they use so often to destroy homes" of Palestinians in the West Bank.
"The main focus of that raid was a refugee camp in Jenin, but there was another incident in the village of Burqin, just outside of Jenin. There were a number of arrests made there," he said.
The West Bank has emerged as another front in Israel's war in Gaza.
It began on October 7 when Hamas, the armed group that runs the Palestinian enclave, attacked southern Israel, prompting Israel to bombard Gaza with air attacks. The violence killed 1,400 people in Israel and more than 5,700 in Gaza.
At least 103 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank over the same period, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
The drone attack was at least the third use of Israeli air power in the West Bank.
Jenin refugee camp was the focus of a major Israeli military operation earlier this year.

Biden administration confirms it will let Israelis travel visa-free to US

US President Joe Biden's administration has confirmed it will allow Israelis to travel visa-free to the United States, despite condemnation and concerns over Israel's treatment of Palestinian and Arab-American travellers.
In a statement on Wednesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said Israel had been designated for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and that Israeli nationals will be able to travel to the US without a visa by November 30.
"The designation of Israel into the Visa Waiver Program is an important recognition of our shared security interests and the close cooperation between our two countries," Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said.
"This designation, which represents over a decade of work and coordination between the United States and Israel, will enhance our two nations' collaboration on counterterrorism, law enforcement, and our other common priorities."
The move comes just days after Israeli Foreign Minister   the Biden administration was set to admit Israel – a top US ally in the Middle East – to the programme in a move Cohen welcomed as "great news".
It also follows a high-profile meeting last week between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, where the two leaders pledged continued cooperation.
But the prospect of Israel's entry into the VWP has faced widespread condemnation from Arab-American civil rights advocates.
That is because one of the main elements of the programme is what is known as 'reciprocity'; countries in the VWP must allow visa-free travel for American citizens in exchange for a similar easing of visa requirements for their own nationals travelling to the US.

However, scores of US and other foreign nationals of Palestinian and other Arab descent are routinely turned away by Israeli authorities, who control all access to the occupied Palestinian territories.
For example, Israel in 2019 blocked US Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from visiting the country and the occupied Palestinian territories over 'their boycott activities against Israel'.
But in Wednesday's statement, the Biden administration said Israel "made updates to its entry policies to meet the VWP requirement to extend reciprocal privileges to all US citizens without regard to national origin, religion, or ethnicity".
"This important achievement will enhance freedom of movement for U.S. citizens, including those living in the Palestinian Territories or traveling to and from them," said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
Still, human rights advocates have cast doubt on whether Israel would live up to its commitments.
On Tuesday evening, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said it had filed a lawsuit against Israel's VWP designation. "Credible reports and ADC's own investigations have shown that Israel failed to meet all of the legal requirements for admission," the group said.

The beginning of the end? The hypothetical future of Palestinian politics

The masked Qassam Brigades fighter adjusts his AK-47 assault rifle before he slides into a chair in the Gaza office of Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas.
'Hello, Condoleezza Rice. You have to deal with me now. There is no Abu Mazen [Abbas] any more,' the fighter jokes in an imaginary phone call to the then-United States secretary of state. Around him, fighters with the armed wing of Hamas snap photos of themselves.
The year is 2007, and   has just fought and beaten a faction of   for control of Gaza.
Fatah lost the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections and was unhappy with the result, attacking the winners, Hamas.
This spelled not only a political fracturing but also a geographical one. The Palestinians split into the occupied West Bank, partially governed by the PA, and Gaza under Hamas.

The situation had remained frozen since then – until now when Palestinians' political future seems more uncertain than ever.
Israel's stated objective for its   in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for Hamas's surprise attacks on October 7 in southern Israel has been to take out the armed group.
If Israel is successful, the return of the PA to the beleaguered enclave is being touted as a possibility. But will it return? And can it?
Gaza under Hamas
Under Hamas, the Gaza Strip has been besieged, impoverished by Israel and assaulted on five occasions in the past 17 years.
In this latest assault, the Palestinian political future looks very precarious.
Israel said it aims to destroy Hamas entirely and that is why it launched an all-out assault on the Gaza Strip on October 7.
Israeli raids, settler violence and settlement expansions   are among the reasons Hamas launched its attacks on October 7, Izzat al-Rasheq, a member of Hamas's Political Bureau, said.
'We warned the Israelis and the international community that this relentless pressure will result in an explosion, but they did not listen,' al-Rasheq told Al Jazeera, adding that  , thousands of  , and the   all played a role as well.
In a scenario in which Israel succeeds in eliminating Hamas somehow, it has been suggested by the US that the PA take over the beleaguered enclave.
So far, Israel does not agree, but what do the Palestinians think of the PA? Can it return to Gaza? And can Hamas be destroyed?
Collusion vs confrontation
The crux of the divide between the two most dominant players in Palestinian politics is their differing approaches to the Palestinian cause.
While Fatah and the PA, whose current leadership is one and the same, focus on cooperation with Israel, Hamas's strategy is to confront Israel militarily, said Aboud Hamayel, a lecturer at Birzeit University in the West Bank.
'There's nothing we can do,' Hamayel said, mimicking what he said is the PA's defeatist tone.
The PA's support base in the West Bank is based on a transactional relationship with Israel, the analyst said. However, some Fatah factions do take part in the armed struggle in the West Bank, where the movement is more vocal and diverse than the PA, he added.
Fatah still exists in Gaza, where it is now in the opposition. Its supporters there are split between loyalty to Abbas and former Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan, who has been in exile in the United Arab Emirates for 10 years, Hamayel said.
The PA has international recognition and receives funding and tax revenues. In turn, it manages security in its territory, theoretically freeing Israel from dealing with day-to-day Palestinian life, Hamayel said, except when Israel conducts raids and arrests resisting Palestinians.

The post-war question
Fatah does want to achieve unity with Hamas, according to the group's spokesperson, even though several attempts over the years to do that have failed.
'Through national dialogue, we will reach a consensus on how to govern ourselves, how to lead our cause and present it to the world,' Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson and a member of its parliamentary body, the Revolutionary Council, told Al Jazeera.
A unified Palestinian entity is the stated US goal, especially as discussions arise on the fate of Gaza after the war, according to Kenneth Katzman, a senior fellow at the New York-based Soufan Center.
This entity would control both Gaza and the West Bank, accept Israel's existence and resume Oslo negotiations with Israel, he said, referring to agreements between Israel and the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in the 1990s.
'I think the intent is to get back to where the talks left off,' Katzman told Al Jazeera, adding that they would be the precursor to Washington mediating a two-state solution.
Rafe Jabari, a French-Palestinian political science analyst, agreed that a two-state solution should be pursued after the war's end but said a new agreement should be drawn up to replace the Oslo Accords because Palestinians were coerced to make too many concessions in that process.
Israel will be unwilling to relinquish control of the lands it occupies, he added, and it will not be able to take out Hamas as it says it wants to. 'Hamas is a part of Palestinian society. They can't eliminate Hamas,' he told Al Jazeera, adding that they're not just a political wing.
Hamas agrees. 'They cannot rearrange the Palestinian house to suit themselves. Hamas will remain, and what comes after Hamas will also be Hamas,' said al-Rasheq, adding that Palestinians would not accept 'the US or Israel or anyone else" telling them who should govern them.
'The Palestinian people will never accept an entity that enters Gaza on an Israeli tank,' he said.
Because it is impossible to eradicate Hamas, Jabari said, the group will have to be involved in any post-war negotiations.
'All actors should be involved in the resolution of the conflict,' he said, citing past negotiations in which that occurred even when one party was viewed as a 'terrorist group', such as during the French-Algeria peace agreement in 1962 or, more recently, in  .
A transition period involving an international peacekeeping force in Gaza was mentioned by both Katzman and Jabari as a possible first step before negotiations.
But, Jabari added, these forces have been abject failures in recent conflicts.
The PA's waning popularity
The PA's government in the West Bank is seen by many Palestinians as collusion with Israel.
Much of the frustration is with Abbas, who is seen as weak for not managing to advance any peace processes in his nearly two decades in power, Jabari said. He is also seen as not having advocated enough against Israel's practices from settlement expansions to harassment of Palestinians, he added.
  in the occupied West Bank have also been criticised as heavy-handed but, Nazzal said, the PA needs to 'restore order and protect the law'.
'Movements of the Palestinian security forces or officials or normal individuals sometimes require security coordination with the occupying power,' he said, adding that everything the PA administers in the occupied West Bank 'has to be coordinated with Israel".
Nazzal distanced Fatah from the PA, however, saying it is 'a liberation movement that doesn't have any sort of contact with Israel".
Despite frustration with the PA, Katzman said Palestinians who are bearing the brunt of the Israeli aggression may be more disgruntled with Hamas's actions.
'Much of the Gaza population now realises that Hamas is going to keep dragging them into a war with Israel, and they don't want that,' he said. 'So I think they're willing to overlook the Palestinian Authority's faults. I think that's true for Palestinians in the West Bank as well. They don't want forever war with Israel.'
However, al-Reshaq said: 'Palestinians everywhere support Hamas more. They see Hamas is working to resist the occupation,' he said, adding that global support for Palestinians has surged in the past few weeks.
'The beginning of the end'?
With mixed support for the PA among Palestinians, what is the likelihood of it returning to govern Gaza?
Nazzal pointed out that, despite Hamas rule, the PA already runs certain elements of life in Gaza, such as the health and education ministries and the banking system.
Meanwhile, the Fatah movement, he added, is opposed to a future in which Hamas is taken out.'We do not agree on the Israeli military objectives in Gaza, nor can we predict what will be the outcome of this terrible assault that Israel has launched against our people,' Nazzal said.
What Fatah knows, however, is that Palestinians should decide who governs them through legislative elections that secure a path for the two-state solution, he added.
'The only thing that nobody has tried is for the Palestinians to live freely in an independent state of their own,' Nazzal said. 'Until that happens, we will keep going from one cycle of violence to the next.'
The US is still ramping up its  , though, and the reasons President Joe Biden's administration has for this strategy is multifold, Hamayel said.
First is to buy time for Israel to finish its military operations by distracting the international community, he said.
It wants to allow its ally to retaliate for Hamas's October 7 attacks while coaxing it to think about what's next, the analyst said.
The White House also wants to keep its regional allies on side, especially as Arab states struggle with their citizens not feeling that they are doing enough to end the Israeli assault, according to Hamayel.
However, he concluded, the PA takeover would happen only if Hamas loses, an outcome still too early to predict.

Hamas, meanwhile, sees weakness in Israel's seemingly directionless attack on civilians.
'The size of the defeat [on October 7] made [Israel] lose its mind and strike out in any direction with no thought,' al-Reshaq said. 'It has failed. It failed on the battlefield on October 7 when faced with the Qassam Brigades, and it is failing now because it is unable to achieve any real goals in Gaza."
In the event that Israel cannot take Hamas out, the fissure between the two Palestinian political groups will deepen, Hamayel predicted.
Hamas would remain standing, a valiant hero for Palestinians for fighting Israel, and the PA would appear weak, shamed for cooperating with Israel over the years, he said.
That would kick off a vicious cycle of a seemingly weak PA inspiring more settler activity in the West Bank, which would erode the group's control of the territory more and more, he said.
'This could be the beginning of the end of the PA,' Hamayel said.

With the Rafah border crossing open, who is exiting Gaza?

The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened on Wednesday, allowing limited evacuations from the besieged enclave to Egypt after nearly nearly four weeks of Israel's war.
The opening could see up to 491 people entering Egypt.By 9:48am local time (07:48 GMT), people were already streaming through the Palestinian side of the crossing.

Two hours later, Al Jazeera correspondents on the ground reported scenes of chaos as people pushed to be allowed through the crossing, angry that their calls to embassies and government officials had gone unheard.
Before 15:00 GMT, the General Authority for Crossings in Gaza told Al Jazeera that 76 wounded Palestinians and their companions had so far crossed into Egypt through the Rafah border crossing, in addition to 335 holders of foreign passports.
The opening came the day after Israel bombed Jabalia refugee camp, which killed more than 50 people, according to Gaza's health authorities. The war has now claimed more than 8,700 Palestinian lives, including more than 3,500 children.
What is the Rafah crossing?
The   connects Gaza with Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. Located at the southern tip of the strip, it is currently the only way out of the besieged enclave. This is the first time the crossing has been opened since war broke out on October 7.
The two other crossings, which connect Gaza with Israel - Beit Hanoun (called Erez by Israel), which is for people, and Karem Abu Salem (called Kerem Shalom by Israel) for commercial goods - have been shut since Hamas launched its lightning attack near the Gaza border fence, killing more 1,400 Israelis.
US efforts to persuade Egypt to allow safe passage for all Gaza Palestinians have so far led nowhere. However, for the past 11 days, Egyptian authorities have allowed more than 200 trucks carrying vital humanitarian supplies through the Rafah crossing into Gaza.
How was the opening negotiated?
Qatar brokered the agreement between Egypt, Israel and Hamas, in coordination with the US, according to a report in Reuters.
The deal is said to be separate from other discussions taking place, in particular on hostages who are still being held by Hamas since its attack on Israeli territory last month.
The armed group is holding more than 230 people, including Israeli soldiers and civilians, and foreigners from numerous countries. Thus far, four have been released.
On Tuesday, a   announced that the armed group would soon be releasing "a certain number" of hostages.
The official list included the names of sick and injured people who were brought to the border in Palestinian ambulances. Egypt has set up a field hospital in Sinai, sending 10 ambulances to meet arrivals in Rafah.
Egyptian media had reported that more than 80 wounded Palestinians would enter Egypt for medical treatment.

How long will the border be open?
While it is known that the evacuation will be taking place for a limited time, no timeline has been made public.
Up to now, only a few convoys carrying essentials like food, water and medicine have been allowed through Rafah into the besieged enclave.
Who will be allowed to cross?
Palestine's General Authorities for Crossings and Borders listed a set of 491 people, some dual nationals, others foreign passport holders, and still others injured Palestinians, that a set of countries agreed to evacuate from Gaza.
There is no mention of US and UK nationals- although it is unknown whether citizens of these countries might have been included in lists for the ICRC and NGOs, which did not specify nationalities.

Palestinians in Gaza can go to 'tent cities': Former Israeli minister

Former Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon has told Al Jazeera that people in Gaza should evacuate their residences and relocate to the Sinai Desert in Egypt, where temporary tent cities could be established for them, amid the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas.
The   has been shared widely on social media, with Ayalon receiving widespread criticism for his comments, which many said were a call for "ethnic cleansing".
"We told the Gazan people to clear the area temporarily, so we can go and take Hamas out, and then, of course, they can come back,' said Ayalon, speaking to Marc Lamont Hill on an episode of UpFront that aired on Friday.
"We don't tell Gazans to go to the beaches or drown themselves No, God forbid … Go to the Sinai Desert. There is a huge expanse, almost endless space in the Sinai Desert just on the other side of Gaza."
In my interview with a former Israeli deputy Foreign Minister, he acknowledged that Israel is collectively punishing the people of Gaza. pic.twitter.com/gZRiz9k3o4

'The idea is for them to leave over to the open areas where we and the international community will prepare infrastructure tent cities, with food and with water, just like for the refugees of Syria,' Ayalon added.
Moreover, the former deputy foreign minister said everything will be "restored" in Gaza, if there is an "immediate surrender, unconditional surrender of Hamas", which Lamont pointed out was a "textbook" definition of collective punishment.
On October 9, Israel announced a   of the Gaza Strip, including the stoppage of fuel and gas deliveries, two days after fighters from Hamas carried out deadly attacks inside Israel.
The decision to cut basic supplies to Gaza, which has already been under an Israeli siege for 16 years, was condemned by the United Nations, which said it was an act of "collective punishment" and prohibited under international law.
Reaction
"Danny Ayalon is actually advocating for ethnic cleansing in front of the global public, secure in the knowledge that there's little to stop him in terms of international pressure or rebuke," Marc Owen Jones, an associate professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Another user said that based on Ayalon's remarks, Israel's goal was seemingly the "repurposing of Gaza into settlements while banishing what remains of the local population into refugee camps in the desert".
Others said Ayalon was calling for a second "Nakba" or "catastrophe".
The "Nakba" refers to the ethnic cleansing of Palestine  and the near-total destruction of Palestinian society in 1948. Zionist military forces expelled at least 750,000 Palestinians from their homes and lands and captured 78 percent of historic Palestine. The remaining 22 percent was divided into what are now the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Danny Ayalon, #Israeli  former Deputy Foreign Minister, loudly and clearly calls for a second #Nakba  and displacement of the Palestinians of #Gaza  to Sinai #Egypt , same as the Syrians! #Israel  is not defending itself, Israel is ethnically cleansing Gaza!

- Dr. Abdallah Marouf د. عبدالله معروف (@AbdallahMarouf) October 14, 2023
Lamont Hill also spoke on the episode with Osama Hamdan, a Hamas senior spokesperson. Hamdan avoided answering questions about whether the killing of Israeli civilians was justified, and instead referred back to the ongoing occupation of the Palestinian people.
Speaking about Hamas's attack on October 7, Hamdan said: 'The Israelis were shocked, these [were] the main troops attacking Gaza for the last 10 years They want to get back the image of the Israeli army.'
In the first seven days of the war, approximately one million residents of Gaza have been forced to leave their homes, as reported by the United Nations agency assisting Palestinian refugees. Humanitarian organisations have described the conditions in the besieged coastal enclave as "dire" or "catastrophic".
Israeli air attacks have claimed the lives of more than 2,329 Palestinians, with 724 of them being children. Meanwhile, more than 1,300 Israelis, including 286 soldiers, have been killed.

Israel releases Palestinian women and children prisoners under Hamas deal

Israel has released 39 women and children prisoners after Hamas freed 13 civilian captives in exchange under a Qatar-mediated deal that includes a four-day truce in Gaza.
Hundreds of Palestinians had gathered in anticipation on Friday outside the Ofer prison, where Israel had transferred those who were to be released, while others congregated in Palestinian towns.
At 8pm local time (18:00 GMT), two International Committee of the Red Cross buses were seen leaving Ofer.
According to the AFP news agency, 28 prisoners were released in the occupied West Bank, and 11 others were brought to East Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club NGO.
Marah Joudat Moussa Bakeer, who was among those released in Jerusalem, said prison officials had informed her earlier this week about a "deal".
"I expected a deal but I had no idea that there was an ongoing war. On Wednesday, they released me from my cell and informed me about a deal but did not give me any more details," she told reporters near her home in Jerusalem.
Bakeer was released after eight years in prison, where she was recently moved to solitary confinement, she said.
'I am very happy I have been released, but it's heartbreaking that we are doing it at the expense of many thousands who are being killed,' she said.
Feride Najeh, who was among the prisoners released in Beitunia, told Al Jazeera that she was "very happy" with the deal.
'We haven't eaten anything since this morning,' Najeh, who was serving a three-year sentence, said. 'They took us in a violent way and they did not let us take our stuff.'
'I am very happy with this deal. I would like to thank Gazan people for their resistance.'
Thirteen Israeli captives, including dual nationals, have been released under the Israel-Hamas deal. At least 10 Thai nationals and one Filipino were released under a different framework, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, which mediated the separate deal. The Red Cross has confirmed the release of the 24 civilian captives in Gaza.
Under the deal, a total of 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and 50 civilian captives held by Hamas are to be released over a four-day period that will see a pause in fighting in Gaza.
Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from outside Ofer prison, said Israeli forces fired volleys of tear gas at the crowds who had gathered.
Among those gathered at the prison, one woman Al Jazeera spoke to said that she had come all the way from Tulkarem, a city near the boundary with Israel in the West.
On the way, she was 'stopped at an Israeli military checkpoint, and heavily interrogated there,' Stratford said, 'highlighting the difficulties that Palestinians face in terms of freedom of movement across the occupied territories.'
'Another father of a 17-year-old boy …said he was not going to be celebrating the release because so many thousands of people have been, in his words, 'martyred' in the buildup to this deal,' Stratford said, 'so again highlighting the mixed emotions here.'
Approximately 8,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli jails, including 3,000 who were detained in the last seven weeks amid increasing Israeli raids across the West Bank.

Here is the   on Sunday, October 22, 2023:
Latest developments
Israel launched a rare air raid on a   in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, killing at least two Palestinians. Three other people were killed when overnight strikes hit Qabatiya, Tammun, and Nablus in the occupied West Bank.
The Israeli army on Sunday arrested at least 52 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including workers from the besieged Gaza Strip.
Bombardments in Gaza continue to intensify. At least 11 Palestinians have been killed and dozens injured in an Israeli attack on a cafe in Khan Younis, south of the Gaza Strip. The Hamas group has said at least 55 people were killed in overnight raids on the Strip.
Israeli authorities say they have ordered the evacuation of 14 more communities on the country's northern border with Lebanon as fire exchanges between the Israeli army and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah continue.
Hezbollah said six of its fighters were killed in one day, bringing the total of its members' death toll in the current escalation to 19.
Israeli air raids killed two workers at the Damascus airport in Syria.
The Red Crescent and the UN have warned that the limited aid shipment that arrived in Gaza on Saturday through the Rafah crossing was nowhere near enough to meet the urgent needs for water and food as well as the needs of health facilities.
Human impact
At least 4,385 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza since October 7, according to Palestinian officials. Israeli forces have killed 90 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in the past two weeks.
More than 1,400 people have been killed in Israel and about 200 others have been held captive since the Hamas attacks in southern Israel on October 7.
Diplomacy
The United States is deploying additional air defence systems to the Middle East in response to escalations in the region, according to reports from the Pentagon.
Canada has joined the US and France in saying Israel was not behind the explosion at al-Ahli Arab Hospital.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's strongest ally, Devlet Bahceli, the leader of the Nationalist Movement Party, calls for an intervention into the Gaza Strip if Israel's attacks on Palestine do not stop within 24 hours.
India has sent 38.5 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Egypt's Sinai region for Palestinian civilians in the embattled Gaza Strip, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.
Thousands of protesters around the world, including some 100,000 people in the United Kingdom, have taken to the streets to express solidarity with Palestinians, calling for an end to Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza.

Israel-Gaza war: Which international actors can play peacemaker?
Newstex Blogs

October 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United Nations secretary-general says he is "deeply distressed" by Israel's complete siege of the Gaza Strip on day four of the deadly assault.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said bombardment has 'just started' after at least 900 Israelis were killed in the unprecedented Hamas attack on Saturday.
Most Western nations have shied away from calling on Israel to slow its brutal military response.
More than 700 Palestinians have been killed in three days of intense bombing, with 2.4 million Gazans having nowhere to go amid an Israeli land, sea and air blockade.
Can the international community intervene to stop Israel from exacting collective punishment on more than two million Palestinians?
'I think it's early to talk about mediation, because [right now] Israel is reacting based on anger and revenge,' Professor Mahjoob Zweiri, director of the Gulf Studies Center at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera.
Here's a closer look at the countries and international organisations that may play peacemaker.
The Arab League
The Arab League's foreign ministers will meet on Wednesday in an emergency summit.
The extraordinary session was requested by the Palestinian delegation, the League's statement said.
Secretary-General Hossam Zaki said the ministers would discuss Arab efforts to "stop the Israeli aggression" on Gaza.
The possible outcomes of tomorrow's meeting remain unclear.
Zweiri says the Arab League has no role to play. 'It's a reflection of the fragmented Arab governments. It has no tools.'
China
Beijing expressed deep concern over the escalation of conflict and called for 'calm'.
Observers have wondered if China will try to promote itself as a regional peacemaker after it successfully brokered a rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
In April, the country's then-foreign minister, Qin Gang, told the Israeli and Palestinian foreign ministers that China was ready to facilitate efforts towards peace talks.
China supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on pre-1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as the capital of a sovereign Palestinian state. It has also advocated for international development assistance for Palestinians.
Egypt
Cairo has acted as a mediator between Israel and Palestinian groups in previous conflicts but Zweiri says it will try to distance itself from the escalating situation in Gaza.
'They [Egypt] want to distance themselves from what is happening because … Egypt is going to elections,' he said.
Europe
The leaders of many European nations including France and Germany condemned the Hamas attacks and have shown solidarity with Israel.
The European Union foreign ministers are scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the war.
The EU's initial response to the conflict was to announce the immediate suspension of development aid for Palestinians. Later it said it would be reviewing the assistance, not suspending it.
Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albarez said such a move was unacceptable and cooperation must continue.
'We cannot confuse Hamas, which is on the European Union's list of terrorist groups, with the Palestinian population, the Palestinian Authority, or the United Nations organisations present on the ground," he told Spanish radio station Cadena SER on Tuesday morning.
Iran
Iran's possible role in mediation remains unclear.
Its Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei said on Tuesday: 'We of course defend Palestinians. We kiss the forehead and arms of the brave fighters and youths of Palestine, yes it's true.
"But those who say non-Palestinians were behind what was done… they do not know Palestinians well. They have underestimated the nation of Palestine. That is their mistake."
Qatar
The Gulf nation is known for its mediation efforts in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and its ongoing assistance to Gaza, which has been under Israeli siege for 16 years.
"Our priorities are to end the bloodshed, release the prisoners and make sure the conflict is contained with no regional spillover," foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari told Reuters.
However, an Israeli official told Reuters: "There are no negotiations under way."
Russia
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said creating a Palestinian state was the 'most reliable' solution for peace in Israel and that fighting alone would not ensure security.
Turkey
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on both Hamas fighters and Israeli armed forces to stop the violence and offered to mediate.
If peace talks are to start, Zweiri believes Turkey and Qatar will both have an active role.
"I'm assuming this because they both have communications with Hamas and Israel, and we have to look at who is capable of being able to talk to both sides."
UN agencies
As part of earlier mediation efforts, weeks before the Saturday attack, the UN was engaged in diplomacy to try to prevent new armed confrontations between Israel and Hamas.
UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland met Hamas officials in Gaza and posted on X: "The United Nations is talking to and working with all concerned to improve the lives of people in Gaza, particularly the most vulnerable.'
The United States
Israel's closest ally has promised "rock solid and unwavering" support to Israel and said it would send munitions as it moved its military ships and aircraft closer to it.
Al Jazeera's senior correspondent John Hendren, reporting from Washington, DC, said talks of diplomacy and of a two-state solution are on hold for now.
Washington has said it wants a future Palestinian state, but it has failed to convince Israel, to which it gives $3bn in annual military aid, to honour the agreements it signed with the Palestinians.
Settlement expansion on Palestinian lands and settler violence have increased, particularly under the extreme right-wing government Netanyahu heads.
Zweiri said the US reaction has been shocking. "They [the US] are basically allowing Israel to do what they want in Gaza.'

Western coverage of Israel's war on Gaza - bias or unprofessionalism?

Publishing unsubstantiated claims, telling only one side of the story, and painting Palestinians as nothing more than objects in Hamas's hands are all unprofessional mistakes Western media makes while covering the conflict between Israel and Hamas, media experts and Arab journalists say.
Experts and journalists who spoke to Al Jazeera said the systemic 'bias in favour of Israel' is 'irreparably damaging' the credibility of news agencies considered 'mainstream' in the eyes of Arabs and others.
As Western media organisations '   and "legitimise Israeli violations of international law" as Israel bombs Gaza, it is glaringly obvious that the vital historical context of the trauma Palestinians have been through for the past 75 years is being left out, experts say.
One-sided
On October 7, Hamas launched an   on military outposts and communities in southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli officials.
The same day, Israel launched a relentless bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 8,000 people, about 40 percent of whom are children.
It also   and flattened much of its infrastructure while strengthening its choke-hold siege by   – acts that may amount to war crimes under international humanitarian law.
(Al Jazeera)
United Nations experts say  Palestinians in Gaza are facing the risk of genocide.
Western correspondents have gone to Israel where they reported extensively on the grief of Israeli families, but Israel has not allowed foreign journalists to enter Gaza, which means they're missing a vital aspect of the story.
'If you don't live in Gaza, if you don't listen to the prayers Palestinians make when they lose loved ones, if you don't learn about the life story of loved ones [who have been killed] then the coverage [of Gaza] won't be the same [as the coverage of Israel],' Taghreed El-Khodary, an analyst from Gaza, told Al Jazeera from her home in the Netherlands.
This means, she continued, that they 'are not just covering the Israeli narrative, but they are living the Israeli narrative'.
When one trauma trumps another
Most of the people within Gaza are the children or grandchildren of Palestinians who were expelled from their homeland during the creation of Israel in 1948 – an event commemorated annually as   or catastrophe.
Rights groups refer to Gaza, where 2.3 million people are squeezed into a piece of land only 41km (25 miles) long and 10km (6 miles) wide, as the   in the world.
(Al Jazeera)
'You don't hear the word 'victims' [in reference to Palestinians] as you hear [when there is reporting] about the Israeli side,' El-Khodary explained.
Rather than cover the human toll in Gaza, many Western media networks either refer to the Palestinians killed as numbers or echo American and Israeli talking points including Israel's 'right to defend' itself and Hamas using civilians in Gaza as 'human shields'.
According to international law, Israel is an occupying force in the West Bank and Gaza. For decades, it has built and expanded illegal settlements  in the former. It has maintained a   on the latter since 2007.
Amnesty International has pointed  to what it terms 'damning evidence of war crimes as Israeli attacks wipe out entire families in Gaza'. Satellite imagery shows  whole neighbourhoods in Gaza that have been flattened.
These 'double standards' reflect a broader tendency of Western media organisations to portray Muslims and Arabs as 'less than human', said Arwa Damon, a former CNN correspondent and now a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington, DC, think-tank.
'What we are seeing right now is a repeat – especially in terms of coverage – of what we saw on 9/11 where [Arabs and Muslims] were painted with this 'terrorist' brush and vilified,' she said.
Palestinians invited to speak to Western news channels are frequently asked if they 'condemn Hamas', while Israeli guests are seldom asked to condemn their government's apartheid policies in the occupied West Bank or its siege and bombardment of Gaza, experts told Al Jazeera.
'In every [Western news] report, they keep mentioning that Hamas is [designated] a terrorist group," said El-Khodary. "But what about mentioning what Israel is doing? It's violating international law, it's committing genocide. It has imposed an apartheid system [in the West Bank]. It has imposed a 16-year blockade on Gaza.'
'Where is the context? Only that Hamas is [a designated terrorist group] and that is the only context they are giving us here.'
Manufacturing support
Unsubstantiated claims made by Israeli parties have made their way to the front pages of Western news agencies, according to the experts Al Jazeera spoke to. A recent example was the oft-reported claim that Hamas 'beheaded 40 babies'.
Despite the lack of evidence, the allegations were reported by The Independent, CNN, Fox News and the New York Post.
Even United States President Joe Biden implied he had seen pictures of dismembered babies on October 12. The White House later  , saying Biden had seen no such images, and that he had seen news reports.
(Al Jazeera)
That claim – and other unsubstantiated allegations like Hamas fighters raping hundreds of Israeli women – was an attempt to manufacture public support for Israel's military response in Gaza, said Lina Mounzer, a Lebanese writer and critic who has written for major Western news organisations.
While an Amnesty International report concluded  that children were killed in Hamas's attack, neither Israeli authorities, Western journalists nor rights groups found any evidence of 'beheaded babies'.
'When [Western outlets] focus on these claims of 40 beheaded babies and women being gang-raped, then what they are effectively doing is justifying the brutality of Israel's counterattack,' Mounzer told Al Jazeera.
'How else do you sell the idea of self-defence when [Israel] is bombing what is basically a concentration camp?'
Fired for empathy
While some journalists at Western outlets may want to do more thorough reporting, many actually fear losing their livelihoods and careers if they speak out against their network's pro-Israel bias, said Layla Maghribi, a British freelance journalist of Palestinian-Syrian descent.
A non-Jewish Arab colleague of hers, she told Al Jazeera, has been instructed by their news outlet not to attend any demonstrations or post anything on social media that suggests he empathises with Palestinians.
Her Jewish colleague, she continued, hates that he cannot tell his readers about the real human cost of Israel's bombing of Gaza.
'My Jewish colleague is just mortified with his editor's coverage of the conflict. That is, if you can even call it a conflict. It's a massacre,' Maghribi said.
Other journalists who are not reporting on the conflict have been fired for comments or actions that imply empathy with victims in Gaza.
Michael Eisen, a Jewish journalist who was employed by the open-source scientific journal eLife, said  he lost his job for sharing a headline on X (formerly Twitter) from the US satirical news website The Onion.
'Dying Gazans criticised for not using last words to condemn Hamas,' read The Onion headline, which was published on October 13.
Journalists at the BBC are understood to have objected to the United Kingdom broadcaster's framing of the war in Gaza.
While the BBC has used words such as 'massacre', 'slaughter' and 'atrocities' when describing Hamas's attack on Israel, it has refrained from describing Israel's bombardment of Gaza in a similarly negative way, according to an email that staff at the network sent to Director-General Tim Davie, the UK's Times reported .
Maghribi says she believes the climate of intimidation against journalists and the failure of mainstream outlets to humanise Palestinians is causing the Arabic-speaking world and Arab diaspora in the West to lose even more faith in the credibility of Western media coverage.
'We're not just witnessing a breakdown in humanity," she said. "We are witnessing a breakdown in the profession."

How have Latin American countries responded to the Israel-Hamas war?

October 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Colombia and Israel clashed earlier in the week after President Gustavo Petro compared Israeli attacks on Gaza with the Nazi persecution of Jewish people during World War II.
After the Hamas attacks on October 7 that killed more than 1,400 people, and Israel's announcement of a retaliatory 'siege' of Gaza, Petro compared how Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant   to what the 'Nazis said of the Jews'.
Israel responded by announcing that it was 'halting security exports' to Colombia. A seemingly undeterred Petro then threatened to suspend diplomatic relations.
'If we have to suspend foreign relations with Israel, we will suspend them. We do not support genocides. The president of Colombia will not be insulted,' Petro continued to post on X.
Israel has been one of Colombia's main suppliers of Kfir fighter jets, surveillance equipment and assault rifles since the 1990s, aiding the Latin American country's fight against drug traffickers and armed groups.
Historically, Latin America's left-leaning countries have sympathised with the Palestinian cause, while the more right-wing countries have followed the US line, turning the Israel-Palestine issue into a proxy for foreign relations with the US.
But with news unfolding that the Hamas-led assault killed 13 citizens from several Latin American countries and with at least 21 more still missing, here's a look at where some of those countries stand on the Israel-Hamas war:
Argentina
Home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the region, the country's President Alberto Fernandez stated his country's condemnation of the Hamas attack on Israeli people, adding: "Violence must be definitively eradicated in the world. Peace is more urgent than ever."
On Wednesday, the US and Israeli embassies in Buenos Aries received two bomb threats via email, local media sites Clarin and La Nacion reported Wednesday morning.
Belize
Belize has decried the hostilities between Hamas and Israel and called for immediate de-escalation while supporting a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and demanding the right of return for Palestinians displaced from their ancestral homeland.
Bolivia
While Bolivia stated its deep concern about the violence on both sides of the conflict, former President Evo Morales, who is running for office, released his own counter-statement to his country's official one, posting  on X: 'The statement  from the Bolivian Foreign Ministry does not reflect the feeling of solidarity of the Bolivian people towards Palestine. The Bolivian people will always condemn the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories."
Brazil
Brazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Luiz Iecker Vieira said last week that his country has 'received with dismay the news that Israeli forces called for all civilians — more than one million — living in northern Gaza to leave within 24 hours'. Viera and the country's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called for an end to violence on both sides.
Chile
Home to the largest Palestinian diaspora in the region, Chile condemned the violence but also asserted their support of Palestinian rights. In a statement, President Gabriel Boric condemned Hamas's October 7 "brutal attacks, murders and kidnappings", while also calling Israel out on its "indiscriminate attacks against civilians" saying it was violating international law.
El Salvador
A staunch ally of Israel, it strongly condemned the Hamas attack on Israel but has not as yet commented on Israel's action on Gaza.
President Nayib Bukele posted  on X: "As a Salvadoran with Palestinian ancestry, I'm sure the best thing that could happen to the Palestinian people is for Hamas to completely disappear… Those savage beasts do not represent the Palestinian people."
Venezuela
The Government of Venezuela voiced its concern at the situation in the Gaza Strip and called for the end of violence throughout the Palestinian territory through direct dialogue and compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 2334. Venezuela urged the United Nations to fulfil its role as a guarantor of international peace and legality.
In a statement , the Latin American country recognised the ongoing conflict "is the result of the inability of the Palestinian people to find a space in international law to assert their historical rights'.

Israeli forces have killed three Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, according to Palestinian authorities, and an Israeli military reservist was killed in a shooting attack, Israel said.
Violence has soared in the West Bank since Israel launched an assault on the besieged Gaza Strip on October 7, after Hamas fighters killed at least 1,400 people in an attack on southern Israel.
Ayham al-Shafei, 14, and Yazan Shiha, 24, were killed in Al-Bireh, near Ramallah, during an Israeli raid on Thursday, the Palestinian health ministry said.
Israeli forces killed Qusai Quran, 19, during a raid on Qalqilya in the northern West Bank, according to the ministry.
Separately on Thursday, the ministry said that 14-year-old Hamdan Omar Hamdan had died of head wounds sustained earlier this week by Israeli army gunfire. According to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, the boy had been in a car with his father at the time of the shooting.
The deaths bring the number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank since the war began to 133, according to the health ministry.
More than 9,000 people have been killed in Israel's bombardment of Gaza, including 3,760 children, according to Palestinian authorities.
Settlers storm village of Deir Sharaf
Earlier on Thursday, an Israeli reservist was killed in a shooting attack near the settlement of Einav, in the northern West Bank, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.
The man was identified as Elhanan Klein and said he was wearing a military uniform at the time of the attack.
Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said 'terrorists fired at a vehicle that overturned as a result of the shooting', adding that the army started to chase the fighters 'and are blocking roads in the area'.
In the wake of the attack, dozens of Israeli settlers descended on the nearby Palestinian town of Deir Sharaf. The settlers set cars on fire and attacked shops, according to local media reports.
Footage from the scene shows plumes of black smoke rising into the sky.
'This morning, dozens of settlers gathered in Deir Sharaf, east of the city of Nablus, and they threw rocks on [Palestinian] citizens' homes under the protection of the occupation army,' Asef Nofal, a Palestinian journalist who was at the scene, told Al Jazeera.
'They also set alight three vehicles that belong to citizens from the village of Deir Sharaf, and they burned down shops on the main road in that village.'
Settler violence has soared in the West Bank since the war began. According to Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, at least 13 communities  have been displaced in the West Bank.
Israeli forces have also stepped up raids in Palestinian communities and carried out mass arrests. The military said it arrested 49 people on Thursday, including 21 Hamas fighters.
More than 1,800 Palestinians have been arrested in the West Bank since October 7, with more than half in administrative detention.

November 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Delegations from more than 80 countries and organisations are gathering in France for a conference on providing aid to civilians amid Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip, with proposals for a humanitarian maritime corridor and floating field hospitals.
Since the October 7 Hamas   Israel has retaliated by  that has restricted the entry of food, water and fuel into the Gaza Strip, and a relentless bombing campaign that has killed more than 10,000 people, half of whom are children.
Several European countries, the United States and regional powers like Jordan, Egypt and the Gulf countries as well as officials from the United Nations and non-governmental organisations are expected to attend the Paris gathering on Thursday, the French presidency said.
Also attending is Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who has called for a "humanitarian pause" in the war, wants the conference to address the besieged Palestinian enclave's growing needs, including food, water, health supplies, electricity and fuel.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), the UN's top aid official and the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) are expected to provide details about urgent needs in the Gaza Strip.
Financial aid
More than 1.5 million people – or about 70 percent of Gaza's population – have fled their homes, and an estimated $1.2bn is needed to respond to the crisis in the Palestinian territory.
Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides will present his plan for a humanitarian sea corridor to Gaza, which he has said aims for a "sustained, secure high-volume flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza in the immediate, medium and long term".
French officials said they are also considering evacuating injured people onto hospital ships in the Mediterranean Sea, off the Gaza coast.
Paris sent a helicopter carrier off the Cyprus coast and is preparing another with medical capacities on board for that purpose.
Thursday's discussions will also include financial support and other ways to help Gaza's civilians.
French help
France is expected to announce some additional funding.
Paris has already provided an additional 20 million euros ($21.4m) in humanitarian aid for Gaza through the UN and other partners since October 7 and sent 54 tonnes of aid supplies via three flights to Egypt.
On Tuesday, the German government said it will provide 20 million euros in new funding, in addition to releasing 71 million euros ($75.9m) already earmarked for the UNRWA following a review it launched after the Hamas attack.
European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are also attending the conference.
The 27-nation bloc is the world's   to the Palestinians. It has sent almost 78 million euros ($83.4m) this year.
Israeli authorities will not participate in Thursday's conference, the Elysee said.

Israeli forces have killed four Palestinians during raids in the occupied West Bank, according to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA.
As its war against the Hamas group in the Gaza Strip continues for three weeks, Israel has stepped up operations against Palestinian groups in the West Bank, killing many Palestinians and arresting hundreds.
Israel says one soldier was killed in a clash during the raids on Friday.
The Israeli military said, that during the West Bank operation, its troops came under attack in the city of Jenin and they fired back, killing Ayser al-Amar of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) group.
PIJ confirmed that al-Amar belonged to the group. Two more people killed were also identified as PIJ fighters, according to the Reuters news agency.
Hamas said one of its men, Jawad al-Turki, was also killed during the Jenin fighting.
WAFA said the latest deaths took the number of Palestinians killed in the occupied territory since the Israel-Gaza war broke out to 110, with more than 1,900 people injured.
Clash in Qalqiya
The Israeli army said its troops came under fire in Qalqiya while shutting down a store whose owner was accused of incitement to violence. They returned fire, killing at least one person, the military's statement said.
Meanwhile, Israeli air raids   dozens of people again in Gaza overnight, according to Palestinian sources.
More than 7,000 Palestinians, including at least 2,913 children, have been  in Israeli  targeting Gaza since October 7.
More than 1,400 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7.
Israel has cut off Gaza's access to essential supplies, including fuel, as it  that has destroyed entire neighbourhoods and brought humanitarian conditions to breaking point.

Israeli forces killed Abu Akleh 'without justification', UN inquiry says

Israeli forces used 'lethal force without justification' when they shot and killed Al Jazeera journalist   in the occupied West Bank, violating her 'right to life', according to a new report by a UN-mandated investigative body.
The UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Israel "concluded on reasonable grounds that Israeli forces used lethal force without justification under international human rights law", it said in a report released on Monday.
Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American and acclaimed correspondent for the Doha-based media network, was   while covering an Israeli military raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank in May 2022.
'The killing of Shireen Abu Akleh in Jenin is a direct result of Israel's militarisation of law enforcement operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,' said Navi Pillay, Chair of the Commission.
'Shireen Abu Akleh is another victim of the excessive and disproportionate force used by Israeli security forces in these operations. This was also an attack against journalists, who were all clearly identifiable, which is a recurring pattern identified by the Commission.'
The UN body recommended that the Israeli government cooperate fully with the United States investigation into the killing of Abu Akleh. It said it would provide the evidence it collected to the International Criminal Court for its investigation into the Situation in the State of Palestine.
The report, which covered the period between May 2021 and August 2023, also found that civilians are paying the   amid soaring violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and that neither Israeli forces nor armed Palestinian groups are working to avoid civilian casualties.
The report was finished before the current   between Israel and Hamas, the most deadly in years.
'Our report is painful and timely,' said Navi Pillay.
'It emphasises that the only path towards ending violence and achieving sustainable peace is through strict observance of international law throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel. This requires addressing the root causes of the conflict, including the occupation of Palestinian territory, and allowing the Palestinians to exercise their right to self-determination.'
The report will be presented before the UN General Assembly on October 24.
The report found that Israel's prevention of food and medicine to Gaza is in violation of international law and that Israeli policies on   are inseparable from an occupation that it says Israel has 'no intention' of ending.
In occupied east Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, the commission also detailed what it described as a 'distinct hierarchy' of Israeli methods used to dispel demonstrators, with Palestinians in occupied east Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank receiving the 'harshest and often lethal responses'.
The UN also said that previous instances in which Palestinian groups in Gaza   towards Israeli population centres were 'inherently indiscriminate' and a war crime. The report also found that Israeli attacks on Gaza were "not proportionate to the military advantage" and likewise constituted a war crime.
The commission has said that it is collecting evidence of war crimes committed by Palestinian armed groups such as Hamas and Israeli forces during the current round of fighting.
After hundreds of Hamas fighters from Gaza launched an   that killed at least 1,400 people and injured thousands more, Israeli forces imposed a "complete siege" on the territory, cutting access to food, water, electricity and fuel in Gaza, and unleashed a campaign of air raids that have levelled  . At least 2,808 people have been killed in the bombardment and more than 10,000 others wounded, according to Palestinian officials.
Last week, Israel said that the more than one million residents of northern Gaza   south before an anticipated Israeli ground invasion, an order the UN called 'impossible' and that rights groups have said could amount to forced population transfer, which is a crime against humanity.

Israel to refuse visas to UN officials after Guterres speech on Gaza war

Israel will refuse visas to United Nations officials, its ambassador to the UN has said, as the country's spat with the international organisation deepens.
Gilad Erdan made the statement on Wednesday, according to Israeli media, as the fallout from the UN chief's   at the Security Council the previous day continues.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres indirectly criticised Israel for ordering the evacuation of civilians from the north to the south of the Gaza Strip. He also said Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7 did not happen 'in a vacuum' as the Palestinians have been "subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation".
Many countries welcomed Guterres's 'very balanced approach', reported Al Jazeera's Gabriel Elizondo from New York. However, Israel was 'furious' and its officials called on the UN chief to resign.
Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who was at the debate, 'was so upset', said Elizondo, 'that he cancelled a meeting with the secretary-general that was supposed to happen Tuesday afternoon'.
'It is really unusual to see this sort of reaction against the secretary-general,' Elizondo added.
'Due to his [Guterres's] remarks, we will refuse to issue visas to UN representatives,' Erdan told Army Radio. 'We have already refused a visa for Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths. The time has come to teach them a lesson.'
Erdan said on X, formerly Twitter, that the UN chief has "expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder" with this speech.
Later, Guterres posted   on X in an apparent bid to show he has criticised both Hamas and Israel for the crisis in Gaza.
The grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the horrific attacks by Hamas.
Those horrendous attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
- António Guterres (@antonioguterres) October 25, 2023
'The grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the horrific attacks by Hamas. Those horrendous attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,' he wrote.
The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned Israel's call for the UN secretary-general to resign, describing it as an 'unprovoked attack'.
In a post on X, the Palestinian ministry described Israel's position as an 'extension' of its 'disrespect and lack of commitment' to the UN, its charter, and resolutions regarding Palestine.
The Gaza war
Hamas fighters stormed into Israel on October 7 and attacked largely civilian targets, including families and a music festival, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 220 captives, according to Israeli officials.
About 5,800 Palestinians, also mostly civilians, have been killed across the Gaza Strip in retaliatory Israeli bombardments, the territory's Health Ministry said.
Guterres, who last week travelled to the Rafah crossing in a bid to get assistance through the border between Egypt and Gaza, in his speech also welcomed the entry of three aid convoys so far.
But the UN chief said it was just "a drop of aid in an ocean of need", as the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) warned it would be forced to stop working Wednesday due to lack of fuel.
"To ease epic suffering, make the delivery of aid easier and safer, and facilitate the release of hostages. I reiterate my appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire," Guterres said.
Security Council deadlock
Backed by the United States, Israel has rejected calls to halt the offensive, saying that would only allow Hamas to regroup.
The US last week vetoed a draft resolution on the crisis, saying it did not sufficiently support Israel's right to respond to Hamas.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken asked the Security Council to back a new US-led resolution that "incorporates substantive feedback".
The draft, seen by the AFP news agency, would defend the "inherent right of all states" to self-defence while calling for compliance with international law. It would back "humanitarian pauses" to let in aid but not a full ceasefire.
"No member of this Council – no nation in this entire body – could or would tolerate the slaughter of its people," Blinken said.
Veto-wielding Russia – accustomed to being on the receiving end at the Security Council over its invasion of Ukraine – quickly said it would oppose the US draft.
US regional ally Egypt also criticised the document.
"We're surprised by new attempts to adopt a resolution that doesn't include any call for a ceasefire to prevent further deterioration of the situation which might lead the region to a dangerous juncture," Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said.
Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki of the Palestinian Authority, a rival of Hamas, called inaction by the Security Council "inexcusable", as did Jordan, another US partner.
"The Security Council must take a clear stance to reassure two billion Arabs and Muslims that international law will be applied," Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said.
Jordan and Russia are among nations that requested a meeting on Thursday of the UN General Assembly, whose resolutions are non-binding, due to the Security Council deadlock.

Algerian footballer Youcef Atal has become the latest Muslim footballer to be reprimanded by a European football club after France's Nice suspended him for reposting an allegedly anti-Jewish message on social media related to the ongoing  .
The move, on Wednesday, came less than two days after French prosecutors launched a preliminary investigation into Atal on suspicion of "glorifying terrorism", following complaints filed by local politicians.
"Given the nature of the publication shared [by Atal], and its seriousness, the club has taken the decision to take immediate disciplinary action against the player, prior to any action that may be taken by sporting and legal authorities," the Ligue 1 club said in a statement.
"As such, the club has decided to suspend Youcef Atal until further notice."

Atal is suspected of sharing a video from a Palestinian preacher on Instagram, purportedly calling for violence against Jewish people. He has since deleted the message.
The Nice prosecutor's office confirmed in a statement it was investigating Atal under laws covering the "glorification of terrorism" after being notified by local politicians.
The prosecutor's office said Atal is also being investigated for "public incitement to hatred or violence because of a particular religion".
Earlier on Sunday, the French Football Federation (FFF) said its ethics committee would investigate the player, with FFF chief Philippe Diallo denouncing the contents of the post.
Atal responded to the criticism on Sunday, telling his Instagram followers he would "never support a message of hate". He did not explain why he had shared the video.
Nice said its directors contacted Atal as soon as he returned from duty with the Algeria national team. The club decided to suspend the player despite the defender having offered a "public apology in writing".
The 27-year-old has been playing for the club since 2018 and has made 117 appearances in various competitions.
On Friday, Atal posted the Algerian and Palestinian flags next to each other following his national team's win a day earlier.

Mainz suspends El Ghazi over 'unacceptable' post
Atal's suspension comes a day after German club Mainz 05 suspended Dutch forward Anwar El Ghazi for a social media post about the conflict that the Bundesliga club felt was "unacceptable".
"Mainz 05 respects that there are different perspectives on the complex Middle East conflict that has been going on for decades," the club said in a statement posted on X on Tuesday.
"El Ghazi took a position on the ongoing conflict in the Middle East that was deemed unacceptable and the club clearly distances itself from the content of the post as it does not reflect the values ​​of our club."

Dutch international El Ghazi made the comments in a "since-deleted" post on social media on Sunday night, Mainz said.
The club did not provide further details about what El Ghazi had written in the deleted post but said, "Prior to making this decision, the club and the player had engaged in an in-depth discussion."
It did not indicate how long the suspension could last.
Bayern's Mazraoui to be questioned for sharing prayers
Bayern Munich has also come under pressure to act over comments on the conflict by Moroccan player Noussair Mazraoui.
The club said it would talk to the Moroccan international after he wished for victory for the Palestinians in a social media post.
"Bayern immediately contacted Noussair Mazroui after his Instagram posts on Sunday. The player is currently in Africa with the national team of Morocco. After his return, a detailed personal meeting with the club's management in Munich is planned," Bayern told the dpa news agency earlier this week.
Whether Mazraoui risks consequences for his posts is unclear.
The 25-year-old posted a video on social media wishing victory to the Palestinians in the conflict with Israel. He shared a short clip in which a voice says in the style of a prayer: "God, help our oppressed brothers in Palestine to achieve victory. May God give mercy to the dead, may God heal their wounded."
Former Aston Villa winger El Ghazi, who joined Mainz in September, wrote in a separate post on X on Thursday that he had "received some negative messages around my social media posts".
"I want to make clear that I'm standing for peace above everything," the 28-year-old said. He also called for "more empathy, deepening our knowledge about the history of this conflict".
Mainz's decision has been condemned by football fans on social media, where some of them questioned the club's action as El Ghazi did not call for "anyone to be harmed".

Fans urge Tottenham to drop Israeli winger Solomon
Some fans have also asked Tottenham Hotspur to take similar action against their Israeli winger Manor Solomon, who has been posting inflammatory content on his Instagram account.
Two hours after  , killing at least 500 people, Solomon purportedly blamed Palestinians for "killing their own people and blaming Israel".
He then reposted the official statement from Israel's President Isaac Herzog, which laid the blame for the attack on Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas.

Liverpool Football Club fan Laurie questioned the selective behaviour shown by clubs asking players to "keep politics out of football".
"I can guarantee that Manor Solomon will face absolutely zero consequences for his post," he wrote.
Other posters said they were expecting Spurs to "drop him from the squad".
The London club has not commented on the Israeli winger's posts so far.

Israel-Hamas war: Why is Africa divided on supporting Palestine?

October 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
As reports of Hamas fighters attacking southern Israel last Saturday flooded phones and television sets around the world, Kenyan President William Ruto took to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.
'Kenya joins the rest of the world in solidarity with the State of Israel and unequivocally condemns terrorism and attacks on innocent civilians in the country,' he wrote. 'There exists no justification whatsoever for terrorism, which constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.'
'The international community must mobilise to bring the perpetrators, organisers, financiers, sponsors, supporters and enablers of these reprehensible criminal acts of terrorism to account and speedily bring them to justice.'
It was an explicit endorsement of Israel's position and – some would argue – the response that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has since unleashed on the Gaza Strip, with a bombing campaign that has  . And it was a social media post that underscored Israel's growing influence in Africa.
As the death toll from the war mounts, African governments are wading into heated debates surrounding the conflict – with the continent split, as different nations take opposing sides.
Authorities in South Africa blamed the escalation on Israel's illegal occupation and desecration of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, as well as sacred Christian sites, in a statement on Sunday. A top official, Zane Dangor, told local news channel eNCA that Hamas's bloody attack, while not a solution, was unsurprising and that the conflict would not stop 'until the occupation ends'.
Algeria declared 'full solidarity with Palestine' early on in the war. The African Union Commission under Moussa Mahamat Faki, while expressing concern over the violence, has blamed the 'denial of the fundamental rights of the Palestinians' and called for a two-state solution.
But Kenya, Zambia, Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are among other African nations that have aligned with Israel's position.
So why is a continent that suffered the worst ravages of colonialism and racism for centuries and that has historically, for the most part, supported Palestine, split now?
The short answer: Africa's divisions highlight each government's attempt to compartmentalise their interests, experts say, and underline some countries' strengthening ties with Israel. On the one hand, there are deep-rooted ties with the Palestinian movement; on the other, the offer of cutting-edge technology, military assistance and aid from Israel. Which wins out could determine how Africa tilts if this conflict drags on – and in the future.

A 'historical and emotional' relationship
African countries shedding the pain of brutal colonial rule in the 1960s were cold to a newly formed Israel and were sympathetic to the struggle of Palestinians uprooted from their land and homes in 1948.
Following the  , the continental bloc, then the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) severed ties with Israel.
Algeria has been a leading critic of Israel on the continent – even as its  Morocco's relations with Israel have blossomed after they agreed to normalise ties in 2020.
Zine Labidine Ghebouli, a researcher with the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) traces some of Algeria's sentiments to the 1988 Palestinian Declaration of Independence in Algiers and even further back to Algeria's history under French colonialism.
'The Algeria-Palestine relationship is very historic and emotional,' Ghebouli told Al Jazeera, adding that Islam as a common religion solidifies those ties. 'We were occupied by France, and this history of brutality is similar.
'On my social media feed right now it's all about solidarity with Palestine at the moment.'
But post-apartheid South Africa has perhaps been Palestine's most staunch supporter on the continent, with Nelson Mandela famously drawing parallels between the struggle of Black South Africans against white rule and of Palestinians against Israel's occupation. Many human rights groups have subsequently also made that comparison.
In July 2022, South African Foreign Minister   on the United Nations to declare Israel an 'apartheid state'. Amid Russia's war on Ukraine, as Western pressure grew on South Africa and other nations in Africa and Asia to condemn Moscow's actions,  , asking why Western capitals weren't willing to apply the same principles of international law when it came to Israel's occupation of Palestinian lands.
Still, that vocal diplomatic support for Palestine masks a more complex relationship between African nations and Israel – one that has rapidly grown in recent years, reshaping the continent's approach to the Middle East.

Israel's growing footprint
After the 1973 war, only a handful of African nations retained relations with Israel, while most broke ties. Yet, today, that tide has turned dramatically: 44 of 54 African countries recognise Israel's statehood, and close to 30 have opened embassies or consulates in Tel Aviv.
Israel's widely recognised prowess in agriculture has helped its cause – at a time when many African countries battle drought, floods and extreme weather phenomena at increasing frequencies. A fifth of Africa's population is undernourished.
'Israel's role as one of the world's leaders in agricultural technologies is a very attractive incentive for African countries battling insecurity and for economies with arid and semi-arid lands,' Tighisti Amare, deputy director of the Africa Programme at the London-based Chatham House think tank said.
'As such, many African countries have chosen to exercise their agency and separate economic interests from political positions in international fora,' she added.
But it's not just agriculture. Trade and security interests too have made many African countries warm up to Israel, said Alhadji Bouba Nouhou, a lecturer at the University of Bordeaux.
A key turning point came in 1978, with the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel.
'Things really started to change following the Camp David agreements,' Nouhou told Al Jazeera. With a major Arab country signing a peace deal with Israel, many African nations decided it made little sense for them to stay away.
That trend gained more momentum after the Oslo Accords of 1993 – a period that also marked the demise of the apartheid regime in South Africa, the end of the Cold War, and the promise of rapprochement between Israel and African nations. More recently, the normalisation deals struck with Chad, Morocco and Sudan represent major wins on the continent for Israel.
South Africa, one of Israel's fiercest critics on the continent, is also its biggest trading partner in Africa – by far.
In 2021, trade between Israel and Sub-Saharan African countries reached  over $750m. Israel exports machinery, electronics, and chemicals to the continent. Of that, nearly two-thirds were traded  with South Africa, followed by Nigeria, with which Israel traded goods worth $129m in 2021. South Africa also trades with Palestine, with Palestinian exports of olive oils and other edibles jumping 34 percent between 2009 and 2021.
Yet, Israel also has strong ties with nations beyond trade.
For decades, it has pumped millions of dollars in humanitarian aid into Ethiopia. Thousands of Ethiopian Jews have made their way to Israel.
Mashav, Israel's international aid agency, has also flown in Kenyan students for training in agriculture and medicine and trained Senegalese entrepreneurs in management.
Meanwhile, in Cameroon, Israeli forces are believed to be propping up longtime ruler Paul Biya by training the BIR, an elite fearsome army unit that answers directly to the president. Israeli media reports have suggested that the country is also training soldiers in multiple African nations.
An Africa-Israel summit was scheduled to be held in 2017, although a crisis in the host country Togo led to it being called off. But earlier that year, Netanyahu, speaking to West African leaders at a meeting in Liberia, declared: 'Israel is coming back to Africa, and Africa is coming back to Israel.'
Despite all of these gains, however, Israel has also continued to face setbacks in Africa.
Previous inroads bolstered Aleligne Admasu, Israel's ambassador to the African Union, to seek Observer Status for Israel in the bloc in 2021. Although the request was granted, Israel's status was   this February, after Algeria and South Africa protested the move. Palestine, on the other hand, has retained AU Observer Status since 2013.

Two-faced governments?
So are African governments two-faced about the Israel-Palestine conflict – trading with Israel and strengthening ties with it, while also, in some cases at least, speaking up for Palestine?
Experts say that neither their seeming contradiction nor the divisions within Africa on the issue are surprising – and point to the recent split in positions after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
'When the war broke, while Russia's invasion of a sovereign country was not condoned, a third of African countries chose to remain neutral in the UN vote condemning Russia's invasion,' Amare of Chatham House reminded.
'It is not unusual for this to happen and expectations that African countries will have the same response to a crisis is generally misguided,' she said.
In another example, African countries, despite intensifying relations with Israel, voted overwhelmingly against the US decision to open an embassy in disputed Jerusalem in a UN emergency meeting back in 2017 .
And politics might soon seep into trade relations. While South Africa is the pillar of Israel's trade with the continent, there is growing pressure from civil society for Pretoria to take a clearer position in favour of Palestine, Muhammed Desai, director of the South African advocacy group Africa4Palestine, told Al Jazeera.
'Last year, South Africa's parliament passed a resolution to downgrade South Africa's diplomatic relations and embassy in Israel,' Desai said.
'As we speak, South Africa does not have an ambassador in Israel,' he pointed out. 'As civil society, we are advocating for our government to do more: All relations and trade with Israel should be boycotted, both at a public level but also by the private sector.'
If Israel's deadly bombardment of Gaza continues and is followed by a land invasion, expect such calls to grow.

Israeli raids in occupied West Bank kill two, dozens arrested

Israeli forces carried out overnight raids in the occupied West Bank, arresting dozens in Hebron and killing two people in the Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Jalazone residents told Reuters news agency on Monday that Israeli forces raided the camp and carried out widespread arrests, where they clashed with gunmen and youths who threw stones.
About 20 people were arrested, according to the Health Ministry.
Israeli forces have currently retreated to the outskirts of the camp, the residents said.
The Israeli army has not issued a statement about the incidents.
In the city of Hebron, 59 people were arrested, including 40 workers from the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
More than 1,200 Palestinians have been arrested by Israeli forces in the West Bank. Hamas, the group ruling Gaza, attacked Israel on October 7, which was followed by heavy Israeli bombardments of the Strip.
The violence has killed at least 1,400 people in Israel and more than 4,600 in Gaza.
The 'last Gaza war'
On Sunday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the war against Hamas could take "months" but insisted it would be "the last Gaza war".
Gallant stepped up the war of words with Hamas as he spoke with forces gathered for an expected ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave.
"It will take one month, two months, three months, and at the end, there will be no more Hamas," Gallant said at an air force base whose location was not given by the Ministry of Defense.
"Before Hamas makes contact with our tanks and our infantry, they will know the shells from our air force."
He added that Israel's fighter jets "know how to make this precise, qualitative and mortal".
"This should be the last war in Gaza for the simple reason that there will be no more Hamas," Gallant said.

Israel aims to end its responsibility for Gaza as ground offensive looms

October 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Defence Minister   has said Israel's military assault on the besieged Gaza Strip aims to end Israeli responsibility over the Palestinian territory.
The 2.3 million residents in Gaza have no access to the outside world except through Israel, which controls most of the territory's land and sea boundaries, and Egypt, which has a narrow land border to the south.
Israel has enforced a strict blockade on the enclave since Hamas took over the territory in 2007, including comprehensive curbs on exports and imports, and severely restricting transit in and out. Egypt has largely supported the blockade.
The Israeli defence minister, briefing a parliamentary committee on Friday, said Israel's military campaign in Gaza will unfold in three phases with the goal of establishing a "new security reality".
He said the first phase, which was under way, would involve the destruction of   military infrasructure. The second phase would include "lower intensity" operations and aim to "destroy pockets of resistance".
"The third phase will require the removal of Israel's responsibility for life in the Gaza strip, and the establishment of a new security reality for the citizens of Israel," the minister said, according to a statement from his office.
The comments have come almost two weeks after Israel launched a devastating campaign of air raids on Gaza after Hamas fighters carried out a surprise attack on southern Israel.
At least 1,400 people were killed in the Hamas  , according to Israeli authorities.
Israel has since bombarded Gaza relentlessly, killing more than 4,000 people and destroying entire neighbourhoods, according to Palestinian officials, and imposed a "complete siege" on the territory, cutting supplies of food, water and fuel.
Israeli officials have promised to "completely destroy" Hamas amid expectations that Israeli forces are preparing for a   of Gaza.
Israel has called up hundreds of thousands of military reservists, and amassed troops around Gaza. Addressing military personnel on Thursday, Gallant told his forces to "get organised, be ready."
"Whoever sees Gaza from afar now, will see it from the inside,' he said.
Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a group of soldiers to 'fight like lions' and win 'with full force'.
"We will deal harsh blows to our enemies in order to achieve victory," he said.
Despite the suggestions that a ground assault could be imminent, officials have given no timeline for any incursion. Experts have warned that any ground offensive would likely be extremely challenging for Israeli forces.
'It's hard to appreciate in fact how difficult this would be, we've described it as fiendishly difficult,' former CIA director David Petraeus told Al Jazeera.
'Urban combat is always challenging, but then you add the presence of over 200 Israeli hostages, you add in an enemy who is willing to kill himself to take Israelis with them.'
A   could lead be devastating for Palestinian civilians in the besieged territory with few options for safe haven. More than one million people have been displaced in Gaza, many following an   for residents of northern Gaza to evacuate to the southern part of the territory.
Many Palestinians worry that they may not be allowed to return home, amid fears of another mass forced displacement akin to the Nakba in 1948, when 750,000 Palestinians were forced from their homes.
Iran has suggested that an Israeli ground invasion into Gaza could spark a wider regional conflict, with groups like Hezbollah in southern Lebanon joining the fight alongside Hamas.

Web Summit CEO Paddy Cosgrave resigns over Israel 'war crimes' post

October 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The CEO of a leading technologyconference has stepped down after a wave of backlash over public statements he made accusing Israel of committing 'war crimes' and breaching international law.
Paddy Cosgrave, a co-founder of the European tech conference Web Summit which brings together thousands of leading tech startups and firms in Lisbon, Portugal, resigned on Saturday after receiving blowback from sponsors and attendees. He said his personal views had become a 'distraction from the event' and apologised for 'any hurt' he had caused.
Cosgrave, an Irish entrepreneur who founded Web Summit in 2009, took to the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to weigh in on Israel's ongoing bombing campaign in Gaza, which local authorities say has so far killed more than about 4,400 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and devastated much of the territory's infrastructure.
'I'm shocked at the rhetoric and actions of so many Western leaders & governments, with the exception in particular of Ireland's government, who for once are doing the right thing,' Cosgrave said in his post on October 13. 'War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are.'

- Paddy Cosgrave (@paddycosgrave) October 13, 2023
Two days later, Cosgrave updated his tweet to also condemn Hamas's October 7  , which killed some 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, calling it 'outrageous", "disgusting" and "an act of monstrous evil"
He added: "Israel has a right to defend itself, but it does not, as I have already stated, have a right to break international law."
First, what Hamas did is outrageous and disgusting. It is by every measure an act of monstrous evil. Israel has a right to defend itself, but it does not, as I have already stated, have a right to break international law.
Second, here's the host of the most watched chat show in pic.twitter.com/HDdl2MrgfC
- Paddy Cosgrave (@paddycosgrave) October 15, 2023
In a later apology posted on October 17 on the Web Summit blog and shared on his X account, Cosgrave said, 'What is needed at this time is compassion, and I did not convey that … My aim is and always has been to strive for peace.'
He went on to say, 'I also believe that, in defending itself, Israel should adhere to international law and the Geneva Conventions - ie not commit war crimes. This belief applies equally to any state in any war. No country should breach these laws, even if atrocities were committed against it.'
The follow-up posts were not enough to win over a list of key sponsors and event headliners who announced they would boycott the event, including tech heavyweights Meta, Google, and Stripe.
Web Summit plans to go forward with the November event while hiring a new CEO, it told The Associated Press news agency.
Professional blowback
Cosgrave's resignation comes as many students and professionals face blowback for their public views on the Israel-Hamas war.
In recent weeks, more than a dozen business executives  have pledged to blacklist Harvard students who belong to groups that signed a letter blaming Israel for the latest outbreak of violence, while several journalists have been suspended or fired due to posts that are critical of Israel or express pro-Palestinian views.
Rights advocates say much of the corporate response has minimised the suffering in Gaza and created an atmosphere of fear for workers who want to express support for Palestinians. Jewish groups have criticised tepid responses or slow reactions to the Hamas attack on October 7.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organisation in the country, denounced the backlash against the students and statements from US corporate leaders that 'lack any meaningful display of sympathy toward Palestinian civilians'.
Those reactions combined, the organisation said, are leaving 'Palestinians and those in support of Palestinian human rights isolated at their place of work and fearful of possible consequences' for discussing how the conflict has affected them.
In a letter released on Friday, dozens of Hollywood A-listers, including Cate Blanchett and Susan Sarandon, urged US President Joe Biden  to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.

Palestinian shot dead after wounding 6 Israelis in illegal settlement

August 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A Palestinian gunman has been shot and killed by an off-duty Israeli police officer in an illegal Israeli settlement after he opened fire wounding at least six people in an illegal Israeli settlement.
The shooting on Tuesday took place outside a shopping mall in the sprawling Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim, in the occupied West Bank.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health identified the shooter as 20-year-old Mohannad al-Mazraa from Azariya, a nearby West Bank town.
Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera's Laura Khan said Israeli police reported that the gunman had opened fire in all directions wounding several people, before he was shot at and killed by Israeli forces.
Khan explained that illegal Israeli settlements were a recurrent flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian tension and violence.
"These settlements are not only deemed illegal, but Palestinians consider them a form of colonisation that is encroaching upon Palestinian lands," said Khan.

Hamas, the movement that has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, praised the attack as "heroic", but stopped short of claiming responsibility.
Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir arrived at the site shortly after the incident. Earlier on Tuesday, Ben-Gvir led an incursion at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem, along with dozens of other Israeli settlers.
Fighting between Israel and the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank intensified early last year when Israel launched near-nightly raids into Palestinian areas in the West Bank. A spate of Palestinian attacks against Israelis also intensified.
Palestinian and Israeli media reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were following the security situation in the West Bank.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed this year in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem and Gaza, with the majority of fatalities recorded in the occupied West Bank.
At least 26 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis during that time.
Officials have warned that 2023 is on track to be the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since the United Nations began keeping track of fatalities in 2005.
Previously, 2022 had been the deadliest year  for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, with 150 people killed, of which 33 were minors, according to the UN. It was the sixth consecutive annual increase in the West Bank death toll and coincided with the start of near-daily raids on the area.
The rising number of fatalities last year prompted UN experts to condemn the treatment of Palestinians, including attacks on their homes and destruction of their property.
Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. Palestinians seek those territories for their hoped-for independent state.

Everyone has a strong opinion on Middle Eastern conflicts.
People who never visited the region even as tourists, never studied the complex Arab-Israeli developments and relationships over at least the past 100 years, and never read anything on the creation of modern states and nation-building in the Levant nevertheless hold strong opinions and assign blame freely.
A question that 'internet experts' have asked the most often since   is: 'Why don't Arab states (or other countries) open their borders and let the population of the   leave?'
They naively suggest that if borders were opened, then civilians could depart, leaving the fighters aligned with   and other armed Palestinian factions behind, so Israel could defeat them militarily, remove the threat and let the civilians back in.
That is just uninformed jumble and wishful thinking, without the remotest connection to reality.
Most ordinary Palestinians feel very strongly that despite all the horrors they are enduring these days, they should remain in the Gaza Strip. At the same time, neighbouring states feel that they could not afford to take in two million more refugees.
To inexperienced outsiders, it may seem illogical that people in extreme danger want to remain and suffer. At the same time, they may question the sincerity of Arab states that profess support to their brethren but do not offer them refuge.
Both sides' positions are the result of collective memories and fears.
Generations of Palestinians have been forced out of their homes over the past 75 years and despite numerous United Nations resolutions confirming their  , they and generations of their descendants remain refugees to this day. Once a refugee, always a refugee.
Palestinians were uprooted from their ancestral lands over several significant fighting-induced population shifts. The first, most unexpected, caused the deepest collective pain and Palestinians to this day refer to it as the  , the 'catastrophe'.
Nearly a million people were expelled from their homes in 1948, more than 85 percent of the Palestinians living in what became Israel. Neighbouring Arab states united to destroy it militarily but failed. They took in their uprooted kinsmen, mostly in today's Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. The refugees endured the hardships and uncertainties of their predicament, hoping to go back home after a political solution was found.
That never happened. The international community talked; promised, but never delivered. Powerful states of the East and West paid lip service to 'a just and lasting solution', but failed to implement it. New wars erupted, producing new refugees. Palestinians held on to their dream of going back. Some still have the keys to their old homes.
The second war between Israel and the Arab world was fought over Egypt's   in 1956. It did not displace many Palestinians, but it drove generations-old Jewish and non-Arab communities from Arab states. Many were expelled; some left on their own.
The next catastrophe was the 1967 war, when Jordan lost control of the West Bank and Jerusalem, and Syria lost the Golan Heights. In the aftermath, more than 300,000 Palestinians fled the West Bank, mainly into Jordan, and 100,000 evacuated from the Golan.
Just like the victims of the 1948 Nakba, the refugees of   ended up living in barely acceptable conditions. In time, canvas tents were replaced by buildings. But the predicament of those uprooted by Israel remained harsh.
Integration of Palestinians in the lands of their refuge proved challenging. Even after two or three generations, they see their hosts as 'foreigners' while they in turn are seen as 'outsiders'. Arabs, but with huge differences.
How far these differences went was demonstrated in 1970-1971 with bloody internecine fighting in Jordan between Jordanian forces and Palestinian freedom fighters led by Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) chairman and Fatah party founder Yasser Arafat.
The fedayeen (freedom fighters) had moved to Jordan from the occupied West Bank and began launching attacks on Israel from there, drawing retaliatory attacks on Jordanian soil. At the time, refugees already made up half of Jordan's population. Those who came in 1948 enjoyed full citizenship – unlike later arrivals who only had refugee status. Hashemite royal family fears that the PLO was growing too strong in Jordan, to the point where it could take over the country, led to a bloody Arab-Arab war with 4,000 killed in battle.
The PLO was allowed to move to Lebanon. From there the PLO fighters continued to attack Israel and eventually fighting between them and Lebanese forces precipitated the bloody civil war that was to last from 1975 to 1990.
Given their dreary past experiences, it is no wonder that Arab states in the region are wary of receiving new refugees, knowing they would almost certainly remain permanently. The non-Arab world is also not volunteering to take these wretched survivors of bombing, famine and disease. Many Arabs ask why big countries with abundant land do not offer to take in some Palestinians, usually mentioning the United States, Canada, Russia, Australia or Argentina.
Despite all promises and even the   that allegedly offered a solution to satisfy both sides, Israel made the return and resettlement of refugees virtually impossible. Practically no Palestinian refugees from Lebanon, Syria or Jordan ever went home. They feel the world has forgotten them, and even tried to reduce their numbers. Palestinian sources estimate that there are six million living refugees, from those expelled in 1948 to the current fourth generation.
Gazans fear that an Israeli offensive could   them into Egypt by force, despite their wish to remain. Having managed to eke out some modest existence over the years in the overcrowded, poor and harsh Gaza Strip, the last thing they want is to be displaced once again by geopolitical, pragmatic or cynical calculations that do not respect their desires.
The prospect of losing even that little they have terrifies them.
They have seen countless declarations confirming their right of return, but no results. Now Palestinians from the Gaza Strip fear that they could become human chips in a game of political poker and vow to resist that by all their modest means.

Western donors cut off funding to Arab groups amid Israel's bombardment

November 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Beirut, Lebanon – Western donors are cutting Arab civil society groups off financially for criticising Israel's atrocities in Gaza, or failing to back them up when they do, according to human rights activists.
All humanitarian aid groups and civil societies that spoke to Al Jazeera said some Western donors had withdrawn financial support for Arab media outlets, human rights groups and think tanks. They also said that they have become disillusioned with many Western countries and foundations because of their support for Israel's bombardment and siege of Gaza.
'The amount of anger and bitterness is not just limited to our people, but to us [as human rights advocates in the Arab region]. We don't know how or if we can interact with some of these Western governments or partners ever again,' said Hossam Baghat, executive director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR).
Israel's assault on Gaza, a besieged enclave rights groups describe as an 'open-air prison', has killed more than 11,200 people since it began on October 7. It has prompted UN experts and hundreds of scholars to warn that the 2.3 million people living there   of genocide.
Al Jazeera spoke to civil society groups from Egypt, the occupied Palestinian territory and Lebanon who have spoken out against Israeli atrocities in Gaza. All said their advocacy and reporting are increasingly at odds with European donors who are mostly staying silent on Israel's relentless attacks on civilians, which may be in violation of international law.
Funding 'cut off without warning'
Days after Hamas's unprecedented attack on army outposts and surrounding villages in southern Israel on October 7, Austria, Denmark, Germany and Sweden suspended bilateral development aid programmes in Gaza and the West Bank, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The pause amounts to $139m in lost funding and affects UN agencies, the Palestinian Authority governing the West Bank and a number of civil society organisations.
On October 11, the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) also suspended millions of dollars worth of funding to six Palestinian and five Israeli civil society organisations.
Zaid Amali, the public discourse and programme director for MIFTAH, whose stated goal is to promote democracy and good governance in the occupied Palestinian territory, said they were given a very positive review after the Swiss FDFA assessed their activities in September.
But, after Hamas's deadly attack, MIFTAH's funding was cut without warning.
'We know that this decision may have come as a result of pressure from right-wing groups in Switzerland,' he said.
Al Jazeera contacted the Swiss FDFA to ask why funding for Palestinian and Israeli civil society groups, which HRW has described as respected organisations, had been paused.
'For these eleven NGOs, the FDFA had external indications that they had potentially violated the Code of Conduct and/or the FDFA's anti-discrimination clause,' Lea Zurcher, the media spokesperson, replied in an email.
Another Palestinian civil organisation, which also lost funding from the FDFA, partly attributed the decision to intense 'lobbying' from NGO Monitor, an Israeli NGO. A spokesperson for the organisation spoke to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.
NGO Monitor operates a database of Palestinian civil society groups which it claims are involved in 'whitewashing violence and terrorism, demonisation and legal warfare, targeting Israeli officials and BDS (boycott, divestment, and sanctions) campaigns, and promoting anti-Semitic propaganda.'
NGO Monitor took some credit  for the FDFA's decision on X (formerly Twitter) and has previously said its research was cited by Swiss parliamentarians calling for funding to be cut to Israeli human rights groups such as B'tselem which work for the welfare of Palestinians.
'There are a variety of non-government organisations like NGO Monitor with innocuous-sounding names that seek to marginalise voices critical of the Israeli governmentbut these organisations never criticise the Israeli government's oppression of Palestinians,' said Omar Shakir, the Israel-Palestine director at HRW.
'These groups don't operate alone,' Shakir added. 'They tend to be funded [by] or coordinate with the Israeli government.'
Al Jazeera contacted NGO Monitor for comment, but it did not respond by the time of publication.

Western funding – 'the journey will end'
European donors and partners have also refrained from expressing solidarity with Arab media outlets – when they usually would – after they were censored or smeared for their reporting on Israel-Palestine, two Arabic media organisations told Al Jazeera.
A journalist from one Arab media outlet, who asked to remain anonymous so as not to compromise funding for his organisation, said Western donors appeared happy to support independent media organisations only so far as they do not infringe on their own support for Israel.
'How the West will reconcile its endorsement of 'independent media' and 'freedom of expression' with criticisms levelled at its tacit or explicit endorsement of the death of [11,000] Palestinians…remains to be seen in full,' the source told Al Jazeera.
'But there are indications that some Western organisations have responded by prioritising their support for Israel over their commitment to regional press and civil society organisations,' he added.
The founder of another media outlet, which also relies heavily on Western donors, added that many partners – albeit not all – have continued to support independent journalism in the region, including his own outlet.
'We always knew that this reliance on Western funding is a trade-off, but as long as we are unrestricted editorially then it is worth doing. When or if that funding becomes more restricted, then the journey will end,' the source told Al Jazeera.
Position of UN agencies 'defies logic'
Regional civil society organisations are also losing faith in UN institutions which either have not spoken out against Israeli atrocities in Gaza or have only done so after considerable delay, despite mounting evidence that such actions may amount to war crimes.
Ayman Mhanna, executive director of the Samir Kassir Foundation (Skeyes), which advocates for press freedom across the Levant, said he was particularly disappointed in the UN Democracy Fund (UNDEF), which partners with his organisation but has been mostly silent on the issue of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and violence in the West Bank.
'They are silent. They have not taken action against independent media [that they support], but their silence isn't something that's really understandable right now,' he told Al Jazeera.
Mhanna added that he expects UN bodies to continue reiterating the stance of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who called for a ceasefire, raised the issue of Israel's occupation as a root cause of violence and urged all sides to refrain from committing war crimes during a speech he gave on October 24. 'We are not expecting them to take a completely pro-Palestine position, but what is happening right now defies any logic.'
On November 6, the heads of several UN bodies   along with global aid groups calling for a complete ceasefire. But Martin Griffiths, who leads the Office for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordination (OCHA),   a 'humanitarian pause'.
RiyadMansour, the Palestinian envoy to the UN, urged Griffiths and others to call for a full ceasefire.
Almali, from MIFTAH, said the silence from various institutions and Western countries that claim to support international law risks completely eroding the credibility of human rights work in Palestine, the wider Arab region and even the world. Other activists echoed the same sentiment.
He added that the global community had failed Palestinians long before October 7.
'They have failed us for 75 years,' he said, referencing the Nakba – or catastrophe – when 700,000 Palestinians were dispossessed from their land during the creation of Israel. 'But right now, we're really feeling it.'

'Necessary' to stand with both Israelis, Palestinians, UN rapporteur says

Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, has warned of a "dangerous" narrative about the   that ignores the history of violence against Palestinians.
At least 1,100 people have been killed since  , the Palestinian group that controls the blockaded Gaza Strip, launched an assault on Israeli towns on Saturday and took hundreds of people hostage.
Israel retaliated by declaring a  and pounding densely-populated Gaza, killing hundreds of people.
Albanese said the international community should be "wise and even-handed" when tackling the result of "decades of oppression imposed on the Palestinians, brutalisation, structural violence of course punctuated also by eruptive violence".
'Like many, I am totally petrified by what is happening. I am totally shocked and appalled by the violence," Albanese told Al Jazeera on Sunday evening from Tunisia's capital Tunis.
"But before anything else, I am horrified by the narrative, by the discourse, because it is possible, and necessary, to stand both with the Palestinians and the Israelis without resorting to ethical relativism, to selective outrage or worse, calls for violence."

The Italian human rights lawyer, who became the first woman to hold the position upon her appointment in May 2022, said politicians and policymakers should prioritise "restoring legality and accountability, using diplomacy and peace as conflict resolution methods, rather than advocating for more violence or standing with one side or another."
"I have been in this role for 16 months now and … since the very beginning, I saw violence mounting against defenceless Palestinians. And this is something that has been ongoing for six decades now," Albanese said.
"The settler colonial occupation, the militarised settler colonial occupation that Israel maintains and trapped both people. Both of them are incredibly tied in the same destiny and one cannot do without the other," she added.
1/3 As yet another spiral of death & destruction unfolds, I unequivocally condemn attacks on civilians. Whoever launches them (Pal armed groups or Isr occupation forces) commits crimes that must be accounted for.
My heart goes out to all Israeli & Palestinian families affected.
— Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur oPt (@FranceskAlbs) October 7, 2023
Albanese has previously   occupied Palestinian territory as an outdoor prison.
The special rapporteur also called on governments not to recognise or support illegal Israeli settlements and to hold those responsible for such settlements accountable.
Albanese told Al Jazeera that many Israelis say that what is happening now needs to be put in the context of decades of oppression imposed on the Palestinians, brutalisation, and structural violence punctuated by eruptive violence.
Israel has repeatedly rejected UN criticism of conditions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan accused Hamas of war crimes, promising that it was time to 'obliterate Hamas terror infrastructure' while calling the group 'savages'.
In response, Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour told reporters before a Security Council meeting that the Israeli 'blockade and assaults' did not accomplish anything, adding that 'no one should say or do anything to encourage' Israel to take the path of violence that punishes the entire Palestinian population.
"It is very clear what lies ahead," Albanese said. "Human rights organisations have said it all along that continuing to oppress a population with total impunity would lead to a catastrophe, and this is what is happening.
"And I am sorry but the responsibility for what is happening is also on the international community which has one opportunity now to be wise and be even-handed."

Two Israeli police officers have been wounded in a shooting in occupied East Jerusalem and the suspected gunman was killed, officials say, as tensions spike amid  .
An armed 20-year-old man from the city's eastern sector "opened fire at police officers who were standing in front of the" Shalem police station near the Old City, police spokesman Dean Elsdunne said on Thursday.
The AFP news agency said its photographer saw what appeared to be a dead body outside the police station with dozens of officers in the area.
One of the officers was in serious condition and the other was lightly wounded, police said, citing medics.
As the alleged gunman "attempted to flee the scene", officers "managed to … successfully neutralise him [and] he was declared deceased at the scene", said Elsdunne.
Al Jazeera's Hoda Abdel-Hamid, reporting from West Jerusalem, said there was an exchange of gunfire near the police station.
"The Israeli police say the attacker has been 'neutralised'. Now, that's the word they use to say that indeed he has been killed," she said.
At least 33 Palestinians have been killed in occupied East Jerusalem and the   in violence related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since Saturday, AFP said.
More than 1,400 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli air strikes and artillery fire on the   since Saturday, according to official figures, while at least 1,300 have died on the Israeli side.
(Al Jazeera)
Al Jazeera's Abdel-Hamid said there is widespread anger in occupied East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank over the Gaza assault.
'This is one of the challenges for the [Israeli] prime minister and his emergency unity cabinet because with every day that passes, those pictures of huge explosions in Gaza, not very far from here, about an hour-and-a-half drive, have created a mood among the Palestinians of increased anger," she said, referring to the formation of a   to tackle the ongoing war.
Abdel-Hamid called it a "very complicated situation", adding that Thursday's attack on the police station could be followed by reprisal attacks by the illegal Israeli settlers in occupied East Jerusalem.
"And then that becomes a vicious circle," she said.

Washington, DC - As United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken was meeting with Israeli leaders to urge "humanitarian pauses" in Gaza, Israel intensified its bombing of the Palestinian territory,  , ambulances and civilians fleeing to safety.
Rights advocates say "humanitarian pauses" are inadequate to stop the carnage in Gaza, where the United Nations has expressed concern over possible  .
"That's obviously completely insufficient and is probably not sustainable over time. It's kind of an absurd approach to this," said Adam Shapiro, director of advocacy for Israel-Palestine at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN).
"I don't know who's legally advising the US administration, but if they think that this is a way to compensate for international humanitarian law, they're badly mistaken. That's just not legitimate."
Shapiro added that calling for pauses also paves the way for an "open-ended" conflict without accountability or political cost for Israel.
While in Israel on Friday, Blinken said temporarily halting the fighting would allow more aid into Gaza, protect Palestinian civilians and enable diplomacy   held by Hamas.
"We believe that each of these efforts would be facilitated by humanitarian pauses, by arrangements on the ground that increase security for civilians and permit the more effective and sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance,"  .
The White House had said earlier that any pause would be "localised", a goal far less ambitious than  .
Still, the stance marks a shift in the US position. Two weeks ago,   a United Nations Security Council proposal calling for a humanitarian pause.
'Not adequate'
Sandra Tamari, the executive director of Adalah Justice Project, an advocacy group, said the call for a humanitarian pause shows that the Biden administration is responding to growing domestic pressure over the rising death toll in Gaza. Over 9,000 Palestinians have been killed as of Friday.
"The Biden administration sees the American public's outrage   and these killings, and they're finding it harder and harder to justify allowing Israel to continue," Tamari told Al Jazeera.
Blinken's visit came amid growing discontent from Arab and Muslim communities over the Biden administration's handling of the crisis. A survey earlier this week showed Biden polling at a record low of   among Arab Americans, down 42 percentage points.
There have also been reports of growing dissent  within the administration itself. One State Department official, Josh Paul, said he resigned his post over the US's "continued lethal assistance to Israel".
Tamari stressed that a humanitarian pause would not quell the anger within communities that support Palestinian rights.
"Palestinians do not want a pause in the bombing for food to get in and then to be bombed again," she said. "It's absolutely unacceptable."
But even Blinken's modest push for a temporary suspension of hostilities appears to have been rejected by Israeli Prime Minister  .
"I made clear that we are continuing full force and that Israel refuses a temporary ceasefire which does not include the release of our hostages," Netanyahu said.
Shapiro said that rebuff echoes a longstanding approach among the Israeli leaders. They can ignore Washington's demands, he explained, becausethey know that the US would not impose real consequences on Israel.
For example,   in the occupied West Bank has done little to stop Israel's expansion there or the worsening state-backed settler violence, Shapiro said.
"The Israelis just simply are now saying effectively to the face of the Americans: We're not even listening to what you have to say because you don't back it up with anything."
Israel receives $3.8bn in US military aid annually, and Biden has requested   in additional funding for the Israeli government since the war broke out.
Moreover, the Pentagon said earlier this week that it was "not putting any limits on how Israel uses weapons" provided by the US. Similarly, the   it was "not drawing red lines" for Israel.
The US Department of Defense also confirmed on Friday that American surveillance drones are flying over Gaza to support "Israeli partners as they work on their hostage recovery efforts", suggesting direct involvement in Israel's military campaign.
Palestinian groups are holding more than 200 captives, following the Hamas   on October 7 that killed 1,400 Israelis.
Since then, Israel has declared war on Hamas and has relentlessly bombed Gaza, in the name of rooting out the Palestinian group.
'Blood on your hands'
Given the US support for Israel's war effort, Palestinian rights advocates say they are not convinced by the Biden administration's growing emphasis on protecting civilians in Gaza.
In fact, Israel's bombing campaign seems to have gotten worse over the past two weeks, as US officials increased their calls for the Israeli military to abide by the "rules of war".
On Friday, Blinken said he sees his "own children" in the images of dead and injured Palestinian kids in Gaza. However, he continued to stress US support for Israel.
But Tamari of the Adalah Justice Project said Palestinians and Palestinian Americans are not falling "for these niceties".
"All Palestinians are looking at Blinken , looking at Biden, looking at this entire administration and saying: 'You have blood on your hands,'" Tamari said.
Tariq Kenney-Shawa, a US policy fellow at the Palestinian think tank Al-Shabaka, also dismissed the Biden administration's softening tone and call for humanitarian pauses.
"Any party funding Israel to the tune of $14bn and replenishing the munitions Israel is using to commit genocide in Gaza is an active accomplice," Kenney-Shawa said.
"The flowery human rights rhetoric the Biden administration is known for is nothing but hot air. If Washington wanted to influence Israel's decision-making, it could easily leverage the unprecedented amount of financial and military support it's providing."
There must be no conflation between Hamas and the Palestinians.
Palestinians deserve equal measures of safety and security, self-determination, and dignity.
We have been very clear that the rules of war must be adhered to and that there be humanitarian aid that flows.
- Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) November 3, 2023
For now, as international pressure increases and demands   become louder, Kenney-Shawa said Israel is trying to inflict more pain on Palestinians.
"What minuscule pressure the   is putting on them is proof that unconditional support cannot go on forever," he told Al Jazeera in an email.
"I think they're trying to kill as many Palestinians as possible in this window of opportunity they have where they're confident that the US is going to go to bat for them, no matter what they do."

Gaza has become a 'graveyard' for thousands of children: UN

The Gaza Strip is now a graveyard for  , the United Nations has said, as it warned of the prospect of more dying of dehydration amid   on the besieged enclave.
The Israeli army has widened its air and ground attacks on Gaza - including houses and hospitals - which has been under relentless air raids since the surprise offensive by the Palestinian group Hamas on October 7 that killed 1,400 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.
More than 8,500 Palestinians, mostly children and women, have been killed, Gaza's health ministry said.
"Our gravest fears about the reported numbers of children killed becoming dozens, then hundreds, and ultimately thousands were realised in just a fortnight," James Elder, a spokesperson for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), said in a statement on Tuesday.
"The numbers are appalling; reportedly more than 3,450 children killed; staggeringly this rises significantly every day."
"Gaza has become a graveyard for thousands of children. It's a living hell for everyone else."
One Palestinian child has been killed every 10 minutes.
Israel's war on children
- Ghassan Abu Sitta (@GhassanAbuSitt1) October 31, 2023
Catherine Russell, the executive director of UNICEF, also said that at least 6,300 children have been injured due to the Israeli attacks.
This means that on average, 420 Palestinian children are killed or injured every day in the Gaza Strip, she explained.
"These numbers should shock and shake us to the core," Russell said.
The body called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, with all access crossings into the Gaza Strip opened for the safe, sustained and unimpeded access of humanitarian aid, including water, food, medical supplies, and fuel.
"And if there is no ceasefire, no water, no medicine, and no release of abducted children? Then we hurtle towards even greater horrors afflicting innocent children," said Elder.
The spokesman said that according to figures from health faculties in Gaza, some 940 children were missing.
UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) spokesman Jens Laerke added: "It's almost unbearable to think about children buried under rubble, but [with] very little opportunity or possibility for getting them out."
Threats beyond bombs
An Israeli blockade of the Strip has also cut Gaza off from fuel, electricity and water supplies, and reduced aid deliveries to a small trickle unable to satisfy the needs of the 2.3 million Palestinians there.
Elder said the threats to children "go beyond bombs", stressing that water and trauma are among other threats faced in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
He warned that more than one million children in Gaza face a critical water crisis as Gaza's daily water output is at five percent of its production capacity.
"So, child deaths to dehydration, particularly infant deaths to dehydration, are a growing threat," he said.
On trauma, the spokesperson said: "When finally the fighting stops, the cost to children and their communities are going to be borne out for generations to come."
Elder stressed that before the current conflict began, more than 800,000 children in Gaza – three-quarters of its entire child population – were identified as in need of mental health and psychological support.
Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), said that almost 70 percent of Palestinians killed in the Gaza Strip during the past three weeks were children and women.
The number of children killed in Gaza since October 7 has surpassed the number of children killed annually across the world's conflict zones since 2019, he said.
"This cannot be 'collateral damage,'" he said  on Monday evening, adding that there is no safe place in the blockaded territory due to the heavy Israeli bombardment.

EU suspends development aid payments to Palestinians after Hamas attack

The European Union has announced that it has suspended the payment of development aid to Palestinians after the armed group   killed hundreds of Israelis in a multifront attack.
The EU said on Monday that it was putting all 691 million euros ($728m) of development aid to the Palestinians under review.
"The scale of terror and brutality against Israel and its people is a turning point," Oliver Varhelyi, the commissioner for the EU's neighbourhood and enlargement, said in a post on social media. "There can be no business as usual."
The announcement appeared to take several member states by surprise, with Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg expressing dissent.
Spain said it "disagrees" with the EU decision to suspend development aid.
"[Foreign Minister] Jose Manuel Albares called European Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi to say he disagrees with this decision," Spain's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, adding that Albares called for this to be discussed at Tuesday's meeting of the foreign ministers.
Ireland questioned the legitimacy of the decision.
"Our understanding is that there is no legal basis for a unilateral decision of this kind by an individual commissioner and we do not support a suspension of aid," a foreign ministry spokesman said.
"We are formally requesting the Commission to clarify the legal basis for this announcement."
Luxembourg's acting foreign minister Jean Asselborn said that his government did not support the suspension of aid.
There were also signs of concern within the European Commission itself, with crisis management commissioner Janez Lenarcic posting to stress that EU "humanitarian aid" would continue.
But the suspension is likely to be supported by other EU states, including the richest, Germany and its neighbour Austria, which earlier said they were suspending development aid for the Palestinian areas.
Hamas's assault into southern Israel has killed at least 800 people and wounded thousands of others, the deadliest attack of its kind in several decades. The Palestinian group also captured more than 100 hostages in the lightning assault on Saturday. The assault included an attack on an Israeli  , where an Israeli rescue service said it has recovered more than 260 bodies.
More than 500 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli air attacks on Gaza since Saturday and thousands of others wounded.
Israel has warned it will carry out a crushing assault on Hamas in Gaza, the besieged and densely populated enclave where 2.3 millions Palestinian  . Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced that he   a 'complete siege' of Gaza, cutting off access to food, electricity, water and fuel.
The scale of terror and brutality against #Israel  and its people is a turning point.
There can be no business as usual.
As the biggest donor of the Palestinians, the European Commission is putting its full development portfolio under review, worth a total of EUR 691m
️
- Oliver Varhelyi (@OliverVarhelyi) October 9, 2023
EU foreign ministers will meet for emergency talks on Tuesday, and Varhelyi said that 'as the biggest donor of the Palestinians, the European Commission is putting its full development portfolio under review.'
Most of those funds had been reserved for the   (PA), which governs some areas of the occupied West Bank.
The PA, which has a longstanding and bitter rivalry with Hamas, has previously worked with Israeli authorities to   in the West Bank, a policy that has damaged the PA's legitimacy in the eyes of many Palestinians who see it as complicit in the Israeli occupation.
The EU said in February that it would send 296 million euros ($312m) in financial assistance to help cover expenses for the PA, such as infrastructure projects and civil servant salaries.
The EU had previously said it would provide "up to 1.177 billion euros [$1.24bn] in financial support from 2021 to 2024".
European Parliament member Evin Incir criticsed Varhelyi's announcement and said that punishing all Palestinians for the attack by Hamas 'will only fuel the ongoing violence".
'Some of the money goes through the Palestinian Authority to the people in the country and some goes directly to different actors as civil society organizations. It doesn't go to Hamas,' Incir told Al Jazeera.
'And this is something that Commissioner Varheyli knows very well. But he is trying to lie in the face of the European people and trying to connect the EU financial support to Hamas. It doesn't go there. It goes through the Palestinian Authority.'

Thousands trapped as Israeli forces raid Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital

Israeli forces have raided al-Shifa Hospital, where thousands of Palestinians are sheltering, following days of heavy attacks in the area surrounding the complexin Gaza City.
Israel's military said early on Wednesday morning that it was carrying out an 'operation against Hamas in a specified area' at al-Shifa. Calling the assault a 'targeted operation' on Gaza's largest medical facility, it said the raid was based on Israeli and United States intelligence.
Israel accuses Hamas, the group that governs Gaza, of using the hospital as a base. Hamas rejects the claim. Israel has not produced evidence to back up its assertion.
Dozens of Israeli soldiers entered the facility while tanks were stationed in the yard of the medical complex, Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum said, reporting from Khan Younis on Wednesday. The raid 'is considered to be very risky and dangerous as inside the hospital there are around 7,500 Palestinians including patients, doctors and displaced people,' he said.
Dr Munir al-Bursh, the general director of hospitals in the Gaza Strip, told Al Jazeera that Israeli forces searched the basement of al-Shifa and entered the surgical and emergency buildings within the complex.
Dr Ahmed El Mokhallalati, a surgeon inside the facility, reported heavy gunfire and explosions could be heard in the compound. 'We saw the [Israeli] tanks and the bulldozers on the centre's campus,' he told Al Jazeera.
About 700 patients remain at the hospital, including about 100 in critical condition, Mokhallalati reported. More than 1,000 medical staff are also trapped on site, but they are unable to treat patients due to a shortage of medicine and fuel.
Thousands of civilians displaced by Israel's five-week bombardment of Gaza, which has killed more than 11,200 Palestinians, are also inside al-Shifa Hospital.
Mokhallalati described the fear that has taken hold among the thousands trapped in the facility. 'We don't know what they will do to us. We don't know whether they will kill people or terrorise them. We know all the propaganda is lies, and they know as well as we do that there is nothing at al-Shifa medical centre.'
'Barbaric crime'
The area around al-Shifa has been battered by multiple Israeli attacks for weeks. The Israeli government has issued warnings to evacuate the facility. However, Palestinian medical officials have rejected the order, saying they cannot leave their patients behind.
Amid the raid, Palestinian Authority Health Minister Dr Mai al-Kaila said, in a statement published by the Palestinian news agency Wafa, that Israeli forces 'are committing a new crime against humanity, medical staff, and patients'.
The Palestinian government holds Israeli forces 'responsible for the lives of the medical staff, patients, and displaced people in the al-Shifa complex,' she added.
Hamas said that it holds Israel and US President Joe Biden responsible for the implications of the raid, labelling it a 'barbaric crime against a medical facility protected by the fourth Geneva Convention'.
'The Israeli occupation and everyone who colluded with it to kill children, patients and innocent civilians will be held accountable,' the group said in a statement.
(Al Jazeera)
The US said it 'has information' that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad use Gaza's hospitals, including al-Shifa, 'to conceal and support their military operations and to hold hostages'.
At the same time, Washington has continued to offer words of caution, Reuters reported.
A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said: 'We do not support striking a hospital from the air and we don't want to see a firefight in a hospital where innocent people, helpless people, sick people trying to get medical care they deserve are caught in the crossfire."
Hamas has denied it uses Gaza's hospitals as a base and has invited the United Nations to send independent investigators to verify that Israel's claims are 'falsehoods'.
Ardi Imseis, an international law expert at Queen's University in Canada, said Israel carries the burden to 'produce evidence' and prove its claim that the hospital has been used by Hamas as a base.
'The object of the attack is a civilian object. Until such time that the Israelis provide proof that it has been converted into a military object, the civilian nature of the object does not change,' he said.
Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera that 'the Israeli government has put forward no evidence that would justify stripping hospitals of their special protections under international humanitarian law'.
Even if Israel's justifications for attacking hospitals are taken at 'face value,' Shakir said, 'international humanitarian law only allows attacking hospitals if room is made for safe evacuation'.
He added:'The reality here is there is no safe place to go in Gaza.'

Latest developments
The Israeli army said on Saturday that its ground military operations in northern Gaza continued overnight and soldiers thwarted 'many attempts' by Hamas fighters to attack Israeli troops from tunnel shafts and military compounds. The army said it killed 'a number' of Palestinian fighters.
A United States official briefing to reporters has said a   in the fighting is needed to release captives in Gaza. Washington expects Israeli air strikes will slow down soon, with more emphasis expected to be put on the ground assault.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said he was left 'horrified' when seeing the aftermath of a deadly   convoy on Friday that killed at least 15 Palestinians.
Human impact and fighting
At least 9,227 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air strikes on Gaza since the October 7 Hamas attack, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.
Israel continued to bomb sites across the besieged Gaza Strip. Air raids have been registered in western Gaza's al-Nasser, Jabalia, Beit Hanoon, Atatra, al-Sudaniya, and Beit Lahiya in the north, in addition to Gaza City's al-Tuffah neighbourhood.
An air strike hit a school on Friday evening, killing at least 20, according to local reports. The Osama bin Zaid school, located in the Saftawi neighbourhood in northern Gaza, had been hosting internally displaced Palestinians.
The vicinity of the Indonesian Hospital was also hit again, coming after a major deadly bombing of the entrance of the Al-Shifa Hospital, which killed 15 people and injured 16 others. The Israeli army said the ambulance convoy attacked was being used by Hamas fighters, a claim rejected by Palestinian authorities.
The UN top aid official for Palestinian refugees in Gaza, Thomas White, said the average resident in Gaza is living on two pieces of Arabic bread a day and is increasingly desperate for water. Israel has  , which started trickling in on October 21.
Diplomacy
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has completed his third visit to Tel Aviv since the start of the war, having met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday. He is expected to meet with Arab leaders in Jordan on Saturday, where he is slated to hear more calls for an immediate ceasefire.

On Friday, more people with dual nationalities managed to get out of Gaza and into Egypt through the crucial Rafah crossing, the only crossing in the enclave not controlled by Israel.
The UN Security Council is expected to convene again to seek yet another resolution for Gaza. So far, in an effort to support Israel, the US has been voting against any resolutions that it hasn't proposed itself or anything that has called for an immediate ceasefire.
Arrests and attacks in the occupied West Bank
Israeli forces are conducting raids backed by air strikes across the occupied West Bank, including in the towns of Nablus, Jenin, Hebron and Bethlehem. More than 143 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the start of the conflict last month.
At least 41 Palestinians were detained in overnight Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank, according to local reports. At least 25 Palestinians were detained from the al-Fawwar refugee camp south of Hebron, and more raids were recorded in Tulkarm and Ramallah as well.

Israel's military claims it has cut Gaza in half, surrounded Gaza City

Israel's military has claimed it has encircled Gaza City and divided the besieged coastal strip into two, as Gaza came under its third total communications outage since the start of the war.
"Today, there is north Gaza and south Gaza," Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari told reporters on Sunday, calling it a "significant stage" in  .
Israeli media reported that troops are expected to enter Gaza City within 48 hours. Strong explosions were seen in northern Gaza after nightfall.
But the "collapse in connectivity" across Gaza reported by internet access advocacy group NetBlocks.org and confirmed by the Palestinian telecom company Paltel made it even more complicated to convey details of the new stage of the military offensive.
"We have lost communication with the vast majority of the UNRWA team members," UN Palestinian refugee agency spokesperson Juliette Touma told the Associated Press. The first Gaza outage lasted 36 hours and the second for a few hours.
Israeli bombardment continues
Earlier on Sunday, Israeli warplanes struck two central Gaza refugee camps, killing at least 53 people and wounding dozens, health officials said.
Israel said it would press on with its offensive against Hamas, despite US appeals for even brief pauses to get aid to desperate civilians.
The Palestinian health ministry said more than 9,700 Palestinians have been killed in the territory in nearly a month of war, more than 4,000 of them children. That toll likely will rise as Israeli troops advance into dense, urban neighbourhoods.
Air strikes hit the   overnight, killing at least 40 people and wounding 34 others, the health ministry said.
The camp is in the zone where Israel's military had urged Palestinian civilians to seek refuge.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
Another air strike hit a house near a school at the Bureji refugee camp in central Gaza. Staff at Al-Aqsa Hospital said at least 13 people were killed. The camp was struck on Thursday as well.
Despite appeals and overseas demonstrations, Israel has continued its bombardment across Gaza. Critics say Israel's strikes are often disproportionate, considering the large number of civilians killed.
United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, a day after meeting Arab foreign ministers.

Israeli troops kill two Palestinians in occupied West Bank clash

Israeli troops have killed two Palestinians during a clash with gunmen in the occupied West Bank, according to the military and medical officials.
Israel's military said on Thursday that a gunfight had erupted after soldiers identified a "suspicious vehicle", from where the two men shot at the settler, near Shufa village, in the Tulkarem area.
"Soldiers engaged and after exchanges of fire, the two terrorists were neutralised," the military said.
This is not the first raid carried out by Israelis in Tulkarem.
Al Jazeera's Nida Ibrahim, reporting from Ramallah, said that usually when the Israeli forces raid the Palestinian city in the West Bank, Palestinians tend to retaliate by shooting towards illegal Israeli settlements.
However, this time, the Palestinians who were killed "are believed to have shot at an Israeli settler on a motorcycle, according to witnesses", she said.
Ibrahim added that Israeli forces prevented medical aid from reaching the scene this morning and then "took" the bodies as "a part of an Israeli policy to withhold the bodies of Palestinians believed to have committed attacks against Israelis and Israeli soldiers".
Local news site WAFA identified the two young men as Abd al-Rahman Atta and Hudhayfah Fares.

Failed peacemaking
The West Bank, which is illegally occupied by Israel, has seen a surge of violence in recent months amid an almost 10-year-old impasse in United States-sponsored peacemaking efforts.
Israel has  , primarily in the north of the occupied West Bank, for more than 18 months in what it says is a campaign to root out Palestinian resistance fighters and thwart future attacks.
The Israeli army has been militarily occupying the West Bank, where some three million Palestinians live, for 56 years, an occupation viewed as illegal by the United Nations and the majority of countries.
In July, Israel launched one of its biggest attacks on the occupied West Bank,  in the Jenin refugee camp and wounding about 100 others.
The United Nations has said 2023 has been the the deadliest year for Palestinians since it started counting deaths in 2006.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the start of this year, according to the health ministry. At least 35 Israelis were also killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period.

With warplanes carrying out air strikes and Israel's announced   of the Gaza Strip, residents have been stripped of access to many necessities, including food and water.
In response to the   on Israel, Gazan neighbourhoods, including al-Karama and Rimal, have been bombarded and the civilian death toll, including hundreds of children, continues to rise.
Here is a look at how the war is affecting Palestinian children on the Gaza Strip:
How many Palestinian children were killed and injured?
On Wednesday, the   in Gaza reached at least 950 Palestinians, including 260 children, with the Palestinian Health Information Center reporting that 10 percent of the 3726 people injured were children.
According to the Defense for Children International (DCI), a Palestinian human rights organisation focused on child rights, since 2005, six major military offensives in Gaza have killed at least 1,000 Palestinian children.
'We know from previous experience that children will be terrified,' said Jason Lee, Save the Children's country director for the occupied Palestinian territory, in a statement  on Saturday.
Children and the blockade
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a   of Gaza on Monday, justifying the move by describing Palestinians as 'beastly people'.
This means that the supply of electricity, gas, food and water has been cut off in Gaza, which has already living under a land, sea and air blockade since 2007 with its borders controlled by Israel.
Since this blockade, Israel has launched five military attacks on Gaza, destroying homes.
Due to the blockade and lack of access to materials, reconstructing the homes has been slow and difficult, displacing the inhabitants.
Children are highly vulnerable to these conditions – lack of access to clean water, sanitation resources, and protection from weather extremes – causing a strain on their physical and mental health.
The lack of food in the complete blockade will also lead to a higher rate of food insecurity. DCI reported that children in Gaza have previously resorted to dangerous methods of collecting food or money for food, entering zones where they can be attacked by the Israeli military.
The lack of water and sanitation facilities in Gaza has previously resulted in children suffering from diseases including the flu and typhoid fever, according to DCI.
Frequent electricity deficits have exacerbated the issue of children being vulnerable to extreme heat and cold, DCI said in the report.
Mental health
According to a 2022 report  by Save the Children, four out of five children in Gaza are living with depression, grief and fear, while   struggle with suicidal thoughts. Children there also experience   from witnessing the deaths of other children.
Education disrupted
Since the beginning of the Israeli air strikes, over   Palestinians left their homes to seek refuge in 64 schools run by UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.
However, schools are no longer safe spaces and according to UNRWA, as at least four schools in Gaza have suffered damage from Israeli bombing.
On Tuesday, the Education Above All (EAA) Foundation's Al Fakhoora school was destroyed amidst air strikes. The programme provided scholarships to Palestinian students in need. In a statement, EAA said that "collective punishment, reprisals, and attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure are serious violations of international humanitarian law, and if deliberate they are war crimes.'
The students in Gaza also experience the constant fear of an Israeli incursion. The Ministry of Education has created training programs for teachers and students in schools near the Gaza borders to carry out evacuation drills in case of an attack.

Have the US and Israel agreed on Gaza's future?

November 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Over the past couple of weeks, the United States has been setting out its vision for an endgame to Israel's war on Gaza. If President Joe Biden is to be believed, his administration is aiming for the hitherto impossible: a bid to 'end the war forever'.
Writing in The Washington Post on Saturday, Biden spoke of reuniting the occupied West Bank and Gaza under the   (PA) while working towards a two-state solution. He set out basic principles for achieving peace, including 'no forcible displacement' of Palestinians, 'no reoccupation, no siege or blockade, and no reduction in territory', insisting the 'work must start now'.
All this seemed quite promising on paper, but the words coming from Tel Aviv were rather different. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had already aired plans  for 'an overriding and overreaching Israeli military envelope' in post-war Gaza, rejecting the idea of the PA taking over the enclave. With $14.3bn in US aid fast-tracking its way to Israel's military, it seemed the war was not over just yet.
The US and Israel are no strangers to mixed messaging. Here's a breakdown of how things work in this bilateral relationship and what it means for Gaza:

What has the US said?
Three days after Hamas fighters burst through the Gaza border fence on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 240 captives, Biden signalled his  for Israel.
He alluded to the 'laws of war' - a reference that would come back to haunt the US administration as Israel's air and ground counterattack on the strip deepened – killing more than 13,000 people at the time of writing.
'The initial response of the US was unsurprising, given the horrific nature and scale of the Hamas attack,' said Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace. 'What came next, though, was almost like wilful ignorance.'
Shortly after, Biden appeared to go off message. He said he had seen photos of babies beheaded by Hamas, claims later   by a White House spokesperson. As the bombs rained down on Gaza, he questioned the Palestinian death toll - figures that UN agencies, based on past evaluations, saw no reason to disbelieve.

A month into the war, there was a shift in tone. By that point, more than   of explosives had been dropped on Gaza, far exceeding the destructive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and pressure was mounting from progressives in the divided Democrats and international actors to rein in Israel.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said he had seen his '  ' in the images of dead Palestinian kids, appeared to push back  on Netanyahu's   that Israel would be responsible for security in the enclave for an 'indefinite period' after the war. In a speech on the sidelines of a Group of Seven summit in Tokyo, he said Palestinian voices would be 'at the centre' of post-crisis governance in Gaza.
There would, however, be a 'transition' and 'mechanisms' for security, said Blinken. Would a multinational Arab force step in to control Gaza during a transitional period, paving the way for the PA? Or would that sizeable role be fulfilled by Israel for what could well turn out to be an 'indefinite period'? To this day, the question remains moot.
What about Israel?
After Blinken's speech, Netanyahu appeared to partly   to the US game plan, saying his country did not intend to 'occupy' the strip after the end of the war. Many pointed out that Israel had never stopped occupying the territory after its withdrawal in 2005, exercising effective controlthrough an ongoing land, air and sea blockade.
But, in an interview with CNN, the Israeli prime minister made it clear he would not be handing over control to the PA. 'There has to be a reconstructed civilian authority,' he said of the PA. 'There has to be something else.' At a news conference, he took issue with the PA's school syllabus, which he claimed fuelled hatred of Israel, and its payments to families of imprisoned Palestinians.
As Israel's  and repeated attacks on civilian infrastructure - including   – have unfolded in real time on social media, a bigger question is being asked. Does Israel actually want any Palestinians left in the strip at all?
'At this point, that's very clearly coming across from senior public Israeli figures who've been using genocidal and ethnic cleansing language from day one,' Friedman said.
The bar for provinggenocidal intentis notoriously high, but Israeli politicians and officials have already provided an extensive catalogue of incendiary rhetoric for investigators.
Last month, Netanyahu himself invoked the 'Amalek', a nation in Judaic scripture that the Israelites were instructed to exterminate in an act of revenge.
Hitting new extremes, Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu was suspended this month for saying that  might actually be an option.
So, are the US and Israel on the same page?
'Even before this conflict began, the relationship was increasingly fraught because Israel had the most right-wing extremist government in its history,' said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who served as an analyst and negotiator at the US Department of State between 1978 and 2003.
Earlier this year, Netanyahu had defied Biden's instructions to slow down his controversial emasculation of  , widely criticised not only as an attempt to shield himself from corruption charges, but also as a tactic for speeding up annexation of the West Bank.
However, the pair go back a long way, their relationship waxing and waning through the crises of the past four decades. Miller believes the 'operating system' of the US-Israeli relationship is still intact, partly owing to Biden's deep relationship with Israel, engrained in his political DNA. As he points out, Biden is a self-describedZionist.

Still, on the domestic front, the US president faces pressures on the left and the right of the political spectrum, with Democrats like New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling on him to take action to stop the war. The Republicans, meanwhile, have emerged as what Miller dubs the 'Israel-can-do-no-wrong party'. With next year's election on the horizon, Biden is feeling the squeeze.
On the war, Miller believes Israel and the US are 'in a pretty serious bind on all of the critical issues', including the prevention of Palestinian deaths, redeeming the hostages (10 of whom are American citizens), addressing the humanitarian crisis 'that will not be resolved through short pauses', and, ultimately, constructing a credible political process.
But they won't be falling out any time soon.
'At what point would the administration impose serious costs and consequences on Israel and make it unmistakably clear that unless it changes its tactics and strategies, it's going to have an extremely deleterious impact on the US-Israeli relationship?" Miller said.
"I'm not sure it would come to that point.'
Is history just repeating itself?
In his op-ed last weekend, Biden stated he would be resuscitating the moribund two-state solution. While reiterating his staunch support for Israel, he hinted at a more even-handed approach, mentioning visa sanctions for hardliner settlers attacking and displacing Palestinians in the West Bank.
Noura Erakat, associate professor at Rutgers University and author of Justice for Some: Law and the Question of Palestine, is sceptical. 'The US presents itself as an honest broker,' she said. 'And yet what we've seen again and again, especially since 1967, is the US talking out of both sides of its mouth.
'Out of one side of its mouth, it insists that it wants to see a two-state solution, but on the other side it provides Israel with the unequivocal military, diplomatic and financial support to expand its settler colonial ambitions and to entrench its projects.'
As Israel's biggest military backer, there are few lengths to which the US will not go to defend its ally. The $14.3bn in military aid that Congress rushed through to replenish Israel's missile defence systems and military equipment after October 7 top up the $3.8bn in annual military assistance the US provides under a 10-year plan that began in 2016.
It is this iron-clad alliance that has enabled what Erakat calls 'a framework of derivative sovereignty whereby Palestinians have some jurisdiction over themselves and some land but not meaningful sovereignty'.
Since at least 1983, the US has   Israel, vetoing successive United Nations Security Council resolutions condemning its expansion of settlements, which have left Palestinians crowded into isolated fragments of territory reminiscent of the Bantustans of apartheid-era South Africa.
The trend exploded under Netanyahu, whose  was boosted by Donald Trump's decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, the former US president megaphoning to the world that this city of shared Muslim, Christian and Jewish religious sites was now the Israeli capital.
Friedman argues that Netanyahu, re-elected for a record fifth time in November 2022, has effectively been 'trained' by successive US administrations to run through red lines.
'He believes, so far correctly, that he enjoys total impunity,' she said.
What does this mean for Gaza?
At the beginning of the war, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant predicted: 'Gaza won't return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything.'
Nearly seven weeks in, UN agencies report that nearly  have been damaged or destroyed, 390,000 jobs have been lost, and 1.5 million people have been internally displaced, squeezed into the southern half of the strip.
With much of the north in ruins and Israel almost certain to prolong a   that has seen imports of construction materials heavily restricted, Friedman wonders whether displacement in the south will become the new status quo.
'We'll have a strip in the strip, which will just be a giant Palestinian refugee camp under security control of Israel, with the international community providing food and water. But there will be no chance of anyone developing any kind of life,' she said.
'I don't see a quick or easy end to this,' Miller said. 'And even if the Israelis come to the conclusion that they've done everything they possibly can to weaken and undermine Hamas, they're still not going to leave Gaza unless there is someone or something that it can be left to.
'Right now, the headlines look bad, and the trend lines look even worse.'

Tensions surge at US universities as students rally over Israel-Hamas war

October 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
New York City, United States - It was an unprecedented scene. Columbia University, located in the heart of Manhattan, took the extraordinary move of closing its doors to the public last week as dueling protests erupted simultaneously on its lawn.
Hundreds of protesters, representing pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli student groups, clashed in front of the stately colonnade of Butler Library on October 12. Three helicopters hovered overhead, and rows of New York Police Department officers stood ready to intervene if tensions boiled over into violence.
But Columbia was hardly the only school in the United States to convulse with demonstrations during the past week.
Since the Palestinian group Hamas launched a   on Israel — and Israel responded with a   — tensions in the Middle East have been reflected on college and university campuses, traditional hotbeds for activism in the US.
Student-led rallies have exploded from coast to coast. In the west, the University of California at Berkeley issued a statement decrying the 'growing prevalence of online threats, doxxing and harassment'. And in the east, emotions were so high at a University of Florida prayer vigil that when a participant reportedly fainted, the crowd screamed and panicked, injuring five in a stampede.
But when it comes to student safety, some protest participants say universities are falling short.
'I've had multiple people tell me, like, to go f*** myself or go f***ing die,' one Arab-American graduate student at Harvard University told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.
She said she has noticed an uptick in harassment against Arab and Muslim students since the start of the  .
'There have been number of times I have to think about how I'm going to get home or how I'm going to walk alone. It's genuinely not OK to face this level of Islamophobia,' she said.

At Columbia, a board member for the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) — one of the groups behind the October 12 protest — also told Al Jazeera that classmates organising with Jewish Voice for Peace were spat upon by fellow students.
'It's not just any one group,' the board member, who asked not to be identified due to safety concerns, said of those being targetted by the harassment.
'It's Jewish students. It's Muslim students. It's Palestinian students. It's Black students. Mostly it's been students of colour. And we don't know what to do about this.'
Another SJP board member echoed those sentiments, saying the situation was especially dire for Muslim students. 'Their security is threatened on campus right now,' the second member said.
Those fears have put school administrators in a bind, with security restrictions sometimes going head-to-head with long-cherished ideals like free speech and open campuses.
'Our University has always stood as a beacon of free expression and open dialogue, promoting a diverse and inclusive community where ideas and opinions can be freely exchanged,' Columbia University said in a statement  this month.
'However, it is crucial to emphasize that with this freedom comes the responsibility to ensure that our campus remains safe.'
That is why the school limited access to the October 12 protests to holders of campus identification cards, the statement said. Columbia had received reports that some protest organisers had attempted to 'enlist the participation of outside supporters', fuelling the risk for an 'unsafe environment'.

Nevertheless, New York resident Amira E — who withheld her last name for fear of backlash — joined a pro-Palestine protest outside of Columbia's gates.
She explained that her goal was to spur dialogue and raise awareness for the Palestinian civilians caught in the war's crossfire. Nearly 3,000 Palestinians   since Israel declared war on October 8, in addition to the estimated 1,400 Israelis  .
'I'm just trying to have productive conversations with people who are not with the Palestinian cause,' Amira told Al Jazeera. 'The thing is, the protesters there with the Israeli flags also don't want innocent people to die either. Nobody wants that.'
But the presence of other outside entities — namely, the media — caused discomfort among some protesters.
One of the SJP board members blasted Columbia's decision to allow a limited number of journalists on campus during the demonstrations.
'This exposed these vulnerable students to national media without any warning,' the board member said. 'We're just students at the end of the day, and now we're getting reports of death threats. We're getting death threats to our email, to our Instagram every single day.'
Some students rallying on behalf of pro-Palestinian groups covered their faces with sunglasses, masks and keffiyehs, a traditional Middle Eastern scarf.
The protests were linked to at least one alleged attack. In the lead-up to the duelling demonstrations, a 24-year-old student was reportedly beaten with a stick while pasting pro-Israel posters near the library. A 19-year-old suspect was taken into custody.

Daniel Katz, an Israeli student and freshman at Columbia, said he was taken aback by pro-Palestinian chants during the protest like, 'From the river to the sea, Palestine should be free.'
'I live in Israel. When they say 'from the river to sea', that intersects in my house. Where am I supposed to go?' Katz asked. He called the chants 'genocidal'.
Another Jewish campus member, business school professor Shai Davidai, objected to Columbia allowing what he considered 'pro-Hamas' groups to demonstrate.
'We're here to say that allowing the university to have a pro-Hamas rally is horrific,' he said as he stood with the pro-Israel protesters, holding up the picture of a child believed to be among the captives held by Hamas.
Davidai said he hoped to push Columbia to condemn such rallies by taking aim at one of its main funding sources: donations.
Columbia estimates that approximately 12 percent  of its annual budget comes from a donor-supported endowment. And in June 2022, its board of trustees reported  more than $535.4m in private gifts, grants and contracts.
That reliance on donations leaves Columbia and other universities in a vulnerable position, potentially setting up a conflict between academic freedom and the will of donors.
Already, former US Ambassador Jon Huntsman has said in a letter that he would end donations to his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, for not taking a strong enough stance against Hamas.
'Silence is antisemitism, and antisemitism is hate, the very thing higher ed was built to obviate,' Huntsman wrote.
Davidai said he, too, would push donors to cut funding to Columbia.
'You cannot give money to the university when the university allows that,' he said of some of the protests. 'I'm calling every donor of the university, even if that means they cut my salary in half or 80 percent and we can't fund anything.'

'Exploiting our anger': Egyptians denounce staged pro-Palestine protests

October 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Cairo, Egypt – On a sunny Friday in Cairo, buses waving both the Palestinian and the Egyptian flags arrive at El-Nasr road in the district of Nasr City.
The Friday prayer has ended and, with it, the only moment of silence that the Egyptian capital ever regularly witnesses.
Protest chants are about to fill the air, as the bus doors swing open and a crowd of mostly young men hit the pavement, holding aloft the flags and portraits of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
Critics say el-Sisi's administration has been organising staged protests like this one to rally support for his embattled government, by piggybacking on public sympathy for Palestinians as the death toll from Israel's war on the Gaza Strip ticks higher.
The bus itself is emblazoned with the logo of el-Sisi's The Nation's Future party. Event organisers, believed to be undercover police officers, start to direct the protest participants, telling them where to go and what to chant.
'We are with you! Go Sisi!' the protesters chant. They march with signs in their hands that convey messages in both Arabic and English: 'We support the Palestinian cause, and we support the president's decisions.'
The demonstration winds its way towards the Unknown Soldier Memorial, a pyramidal monument in honour of the Egyptians and Arabs who lost their lives in the 1973 October War.
There, microphones and a stage have been set up for accredited media to document the scene, with the help of several drones that fly above the attendees.
"It was a comedy show. Most people who were there were hired or paid to come," one pro-Palestine supporter – who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions – told Al Jazeera, after deciding not to join the rally. "Proof of that is that we saw buses in the city centre saying they were ready to give you a ride to the gathering's location for free."
Hossam el-Hamalawy, Egyptian journalist and scholar-activist now based in Germany, also said that 'there were directives by the different ministries to take to the streets in these mobilisations, as well as the state-pact trade union federations, who also mobilised their workers'.
'The state-organised protests are, simply put, strategic ways in which the state exploits Egyptian society's deprivation of political freedom and expression to manipulate the masses and further state propaganda,' another pro-Palestine demonstrator told Al Jazeera, likewise asking for their identity to be withheld.
Photos taken of the protest would be used to create propaganda, showing 'public support for the regime', ahead of December's presidential elections, this protester claimed.

'They started beating the protesters heavily'
Both of the pro-Palestinian supporters said they would go instead to Mostafa Mahmoud Square, where a grassroots gathering was set to take place.
However, the police reportedly made the gathering in the square dissolve, as happened with a similar pro-Palestinian demonstration in the Al-Azhar mosque that same day.
The demonstrators ultimately started marching towards a symbolic place in the history of Egypt's protest movements: Tahrir Square. The 2011 Arab Spring protests converged there, culminating in the removal of then-President Hosni Mubarak.
According to the attendees, as people began to arrive in the streets surrounding the square on Friday, armed forces stepped in to prevent a large gathering from forming.
However, large groups running towards the square were able to overcome the police line, and a large demonstration formed, with participants chanting: 'The people want the fall of Israel.'
'It was the first time that we entered Tahrir – in a protest – since 2013,' one of the protesters who refused to go to the government-organised demonstration said. But their presence in the square would not last for long.
'Not long after the people bravely stood in Tahrir to protest, the police and security forces in civilian clothes and the thugs started using brute force to evacuate the protesters and intimidate them,' the second Pro-Palestinian supporter who spoke to Al Jazeera said. 'They started beating the protesters heavily and chasing them away, out of the square.'
According to independent Egyptian news outlet Mada Masr, 43 people were arrested. The second protester said they and other participants in the rally 'don't know the status of those arrested as of now and aren't certain what their fate is'.
The el-Sisi government has long been accused of systematic political repression and censorship, including by groups like  .
Human Rights Watch, for instance, accused Egyptian forces of committing 'arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances and torture of real or suspected political activists as well as ordinary citizens'.
'Sisi has crushed dissent over the past 10 years from his coup, and the protests at this point are significant,' said El-Hamalawy, who focuses on the repression of the state apparatus in Egypt in his research. 'Palestine, once again, is reviving street dissent. During the first week of the attacks, spontaneous protests broke out on a small scale, and the regime felt alarmed.'
'The Palestinian cause is the most politicising factor for the Egyptian youth and the Egyptian public opinion,' El-Hamalawy added. 'After all, the 2011 revolution was the climax of a process of dissent that started in the country in the year 2000, with the second Palestinian Intifada.'

Gaza's suffering 'just a few hours away'
This lack of freedom angers many Egyptians who hope to protest in support of Palestinians without fear of reprisals.
They fear the only safe way to protest is under the explicit command of Egyptian officials.
'They're basically exploiting our anger, frustration and lack of political freedom – and freedom of speech, thought and expression – to persuade, manipulate and even bribe us into demonstrating in favour of them,' the second pro-Palestinian protester said.
The violence and proximity of the conflict have left them shaken. Gaza – the site of   – shares a border with Egypt.
'For how long are we going to stand by and watch as people in Gaza, just a few hours away from us, are forced to live in the cruel, inhumane conditions enforced by the cruel, brutal occupation forces?' they asked. On Saturday, the first convoy of a few aid trucks crossed the Rafah border from Egypt to Gaza.
The grassroots outrage at the mounting Palestinian death toll has even bled into the government-organised protest. Witnesses claim that 'true protesters' started gathering there, only to be expelled by Egyptian armed forces.
'I think it was a big mistake of the regime to orchestrate what we saw in Nasr City, because they made it about themselves," the other pro-Palestinian supporter said.
His fellow protester chimed in. 'I can't help but feel hopeless and helpless,' they said.
'To be able to exercise any form of solidarity with Palestine beyond just my phone screen, I have to choose between demonstrating in safer conditions but feeding into the state's agenda – both related and unrelated to Palestine – or demonstrating in grassroots protests that I feel represent me and my views, beliefs and values but risk my safety and freedom.'

The violence unleashed by the state of Israel and Hamas fighters has gone beyond war to become 'terrorism', Pope Francis has stated.
Speaking in unscripted remarks at his Wednesday general audience in St Peter's Square, the head of the Catholic Church said he had heard directly how 'both sides are suffering' during meetings with the Israeli relatives of Hamas-held captives and with Palestinians who have family in Gaza.
"This is what wars do. But here, we have gone beyond wars. This is not war. This is terrorism," he said.
He asked for prayers so that both sides would "not go ahead with passions, which, in the end, kill everyone".
The pope's meetings and his comments came hours after Israel and Hamas   mediated by  .
The two sides agreed to the release of 50 women and children held captive in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli custody.
The agreement also includes desperately needed humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza following weeks of relentless Israeli attacks that have killed more than 14,100 people, including 5,600 children, and forced about 1.7 million from their homes.
About 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's attack on Israel.

Hamas releases two women held hostage after Egyptian-Qatari diplomacy

Two women held captive by Hamas in Gaza have been released, according to the Palestinian group and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
A spokesperson for the armed wing of Hamas said the two captives were released following mediation from Qatar and Egypt.
In a statement on Monday, spokesperson Abu Obeida said on the group's Telegram channel that the captives had been released for "humanitarian reasons and poor health grounds."
The release of the two hostages, 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper, was confirmed by the ICRC.
"We hope they will soon be back with their loved ones," it said on X, formerly Twitter.
Hamas seized more than 200 people, including Israelis and dual nationals, during an assault on southern Israel on October 7. The Palestinian group killed more than 1,400 people, many of them civilians, during the attack, according to Israeli authorities.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the unconditional release of all hostages held in Gaza. Human rights groups, international organisations and families of those   have also called for their immediate release.
The   since the October 7 attack took place on Friday, with Hamas freeing two women with United States citizenship, Judith Raanan and her daughter Natalie, following mediation efforts by Qatar.
A Qatar foreign ministry spokesperson said that the release came "after many days of continuous communication" with all involved parties.
Obeida had previously stated that Hamas offered to free two additional captives alongside Judith and Natalie last Friday, but were rebuffed by Israeli authorities.
Israel has called that claim 'mendacious propaganda' and suggested that Hamas is seeking to improve its image as harrowing stories of Hamas gunmen  , some using gruesome methods, are met with strong condemnation around the world.
With the Israeli military preparing for an expected ground invasion of the besieged Gaza Strip, the families of those kidnapped and taken captive have been confronted with painful dilemmas, with some urging the Israeli government to prioritise freeing hostages while others say they understand the emphasis on attacking Hamas.
"We need to talk to Hamas. We can't always resort to war. We have so many Palestinian prisoners we can swap for our people," Carmel Gorni, a political activist whose cousin Yiftah Gorni was killed in the assault, told the news outlet Reuters.
"If our soldiers go in, many people will die, including the hostages."
According to a report in the New York Times, the US is   to delay a ground assault in order to allow for more time to secure the release of those held captive.
Israel has also been accused of showing disregard for the lives of Palestinian civilians in its response to the attack by Hamas, cutting off access to food, water, fuel, and electricity to Gaza's 2.3 million residents as it carries out a relentless   that have levelled entire neighbourhoods and brought humanitarian conditions to a breaking point.
More than 5,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli bombardment, according to Palestinian authorities.

'All scenarios are open': Hezbollah leader in first speech since Gaza war

November 3rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Hezbollah leader   has said that a wider regional escalation could not be ruled out if Israel continues its war in Gaza, in his first speech since the war broke out.
Tens of thousands of people watched the widely anticipated televised address on Friday from rallies called by the Lebanese group to honour fallen fighters.
In his lengthy remarks, Nasrallah said that "all scenarios are open on our Lebanese southern front" and that "what happens on the Lebanese front will depend on what happens in Gaza", calling on Israel to stop its attacks on the besieged strip to avoid a regional conflagration.
Nasrallah said Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel was '100 percent Palestinian' and expressed support for the Palestinian group, but stopped short of declaring all-out war against Israel, as many had feared.
The Hezbollah leader praised the Hamas attack four weeks ago, which targeted villages and military posts in southern Israel. More than 1,400 people were killed in Israel in that attack, mostly civilians according to Israeli authorities.
Since then, more than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed in an air and ground assault by the Israeli military on Gaza, most of them women and children.
"This great, large-scale operation was purely the result of Palestinian planning and implementation," Nasrallah said, suggesting Hezbollah had no part in the attack. "The great secrecy made this operation greatly successful."
US 'responsible' for the war
Nasrallah said that one of the biggest mistakes Israel was making now in its war against Hamas in Gaza was pursuing goals that it cannot achieve.
"For a whole month, Israel could not offer a single military achievement," he said, adding that Israel can only get back hostages through negotiation.
Nasrallah blamed the conflict and high Palestinian civilian death toll on the United States, as US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken was meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.
Netanyahu told Blinken that he rejected any temporary halt to the fighting that did not include the release of the more than 200 Israeli hostages. 'We won't stop until victory,' Netanyahu said, adding that this means 'to destroy Hamas, [and attain the] return of the hostages and the restoration of security for our citizens and children'.
'The United States is totally responsible for the war raging in Gaza,' Nasrallah said.
Blinken acknowledged that more needed to be done to "protect Palestinian civilians" in Gaza and that, without that, there will be "no partners for peace".
Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv on Friday, Blinken also said, "We need to substantially and immediately increase the sustainable humanitarian assistance" into Gaza.
'Enable resistance to triumph'
Nasrallah said the two objectives of the group now were to end the war and "enable the resistance to triumph".
He said 'the victory of Gaza means the victory of the Palestinian people,' and that that would be in the interest of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, as well as Lebanon. He called on the Arab world to recall their ambassadors and cut off oil and gas and food supplies to Israel.
Since the beginning of the war, Hezbollah, an ally of the armed Palestinian group Hamas, had taken calculated steps to keep Israel's military busy on its border with Lebanon, but not to the extent of igniting an all-out war.
Nasrallah insisted that Hezbollah has 'been in this battle since October 8', pointing out that what's happening on the border is 'unprecedented since 1948', when Israel was created and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced during the Nakba, or "catastrophe".
Celebratory gunshots rang out over Lebanon's capital Beirut as thousands packed into a square in the southern suburbs to watch the speech, which many people in Lebanon were anxiously awaiting, rattled for weeks by fears the conflict could spread to the rest of the region.
His address was also keenly watched outside Lebanon, as Nasrallah is a leading voice in the informal alliance known as the 'Axis of Resistance', led by Iran to counter the influence of the United States and Israel.
The coalition includes Shia Muslim Iraqi militias, which have been firing at US forces in Syria and Iraq, and Yemen's Houthis, who have waded into the conflict by firing drones at Israel.
The speech came a day after the most significant escalation in clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces on the border since the war started.

As Israel pounds Gaza, BBC journalists accuse broadcaster of bias

November 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
London, United Kingdom - The BBC has been accused by its journalists of failing to tell the story of the Israel-Hamas conflict accurately, investing greater effort in humanising Israeli victims compared with Palestinians, and omitting key historical context in coverage.
In a 2,300-word letter written to Al Jazeera by eight UK-based journalists employed by the corporation, the BBC is also said to be guilty of a 'double standard in how civilians are seen', given that it is 'unflinching' in its reporting of alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine.
Fearing reprisal, the journalists requested anonymity. The group does not plan to send the letter to BBC executives, believing such a move was unlikely to lead to meaningful discussions.
They sent Al Jazeera the letter as a humanitarian disaster in Gaza escalates, and as grim milestones are reached at pace. At the time of writing, more than 14,500 Palestinians have been reported as   by Israeli bombardment, including at least 6,000 children.
'The BBC has failed to accurately tell this story – through omission and lack of critical engagement with Israel's claims – and it has therefore failed to help the public engage with and understand the human rights abuses unfolding in Gaza,' the letter reads. 'Thousands of Palestinians have been killed since October 7. When will the number be high enough for our editorial stance to change?'
Israel declared war against   after the Palestinian group, which governs the densely populated enclave, attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostage.
Rights groups and hundreds of thousands of  , outraged by the soaring Palestinian death toll in Gaza, have called for a ceasefire.
The war has also divided newsrooms globally, with disagreements over how each side is being portrayed, the level of empathy shown to Israeli and Palestinian victims, and the use of language.
The BBC journalists said that across British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) platforms, terms like 'massacre' and 'atrocity', have been reserved 'only for Hamas, framing the group as the only instigator and perpetrator of violence in the region. This is inaccurate but aligns with the BBC's overall coverage'.
The Hamas assault, while 'appalling and devastating does not justify the indiscriminate killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians, and the BBC cannot be seen to support – or fail to interrogate – the logic that it does,' their letter reads.
'We are asking the BBC to better reflect and defer to the evidence-based findings of official and unbiased humanitarian organisations."
'Humanising coverage of Palestinian civilians has been lacking'
The journalists appealed to the corporation to 'ensure that the equal treatment of all civilians is at the heart of its coverage'.
They claimed that the broadcaster carefully portrays Israeli suffering by, for instance, telling audiences the names of victims, covering individual funerals, and interviewing affected families.
'In comparison, humanising coverage of Palestinian civilians has been lacking. It is a poor excuse to say that the BBC could not better cover stories in Gaza because of difficulties gaining access to the [Gaza] Strip This is achieved, for example, by telling and following individual stories across weeks. Little attempt has also been made to fully utilise the abundance of social media content from brave journalists in Gaza and the West Bank.'
The journalists acknowledged 'some strong isolated examples', but said sensitively told stories about Palestinians were not 'consistent', particularly after the outbreak of war.
'It is largely in the last few weeks – as civilian deaths have exponentially increased and Western countries' appetite for Israel's attacks has waned – that the BBC has made more effort to humanise Palestinian civilians. For many, this feels too little too late, and shows that the positions taken by governments in the UK and US have undue influence on coverage.'
Al Jazeera interviewed two of the eight co-writers. Some of those behind the letter are people of colour.
'This organisation doesn't represent us,' one of the co-writers told Al Jazeera.
'For me, and definitely for other people of colour, we can see blatantly that certain civilian lives are considered more worthy than others – that there is some sort of hierarchy at play. That is deeply, deeply hurtful because actually, none of us struggle to empathise with Palestinian civilians.
The journalist said that to them, it appears some staff members and senior reporters 'don't empathise as much with [Palestinians], as they do, for example, with Ukrainian civilians'.
The second co-writer Al Jazeera interviewed said they felt 'sickened by the senseless loss of civilian life' during the Hamas attacks.
'I also felt a number of overlapping fears [including] that the coverage of my employer, the BBC, would fail in its duty to sufficiently interrogate this [Israeli] response or provide adequate context on decades of occupation.'
'My fears were immediately confirmed.'
The letter says that the BBC has organised 'trauma support and listening sessions' for staff affected by the conflict.
'But for many of us – especially people of colour – the BBC's coverage has been part of our distress,' the letter says.
Further critiquing the BBC's storytelling, the journalists argue that while Palestinians have been asked whether they 'condemn Hamas', the same cannot be said for guests who defend Israel's actions.
'[They] are not equally asked to 'condemn' the actions of the Israeli government, however high the civilian death toll in Gaza.'
On October 9, the BBC was criticised as lacking compassion over its interview with Husam Zomlot, the head of the Palestinian Mission to the United Kingdom, who lost several members of his family during the early days of Israel's bombing campaign.
Zomlot, who does not represent Hamas, told presenter Kirsty Wark of his emotional pain. He listed the relatives who had been killed, describing them as 'sitting ducks for the Israeli war machine'.
Wark replied: 'I am sorry for your own personal loss. I mean, can I just be clear though, you cannot condone the killing of civilians in Israel, can you? Nor the killing of families?'
Zomlot, taken aback, replied: 'No we don't condone, no we don't.'
My cousin is not Hamas. These kids are not Hamas.

- BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) October 9, 2023
The letter also claims that the BBC is failing to provide audiences with important background about Israel's occupation and the history of Palestinian suffering.
'For Israel's bombardment to be considered 'self-defence', events must begin with the Hamas-led attack,' they said. 'News updates and articles neglect to include a line or two of critical historical context – on 75 years of occupation, the Nakba, or the asymmetric death toll across decades.'
 , or catastrophe, refers to the displacement and dispossession of Palestinians between 1947 and 1949, when Zionist paramilitaries and then Israel's newly formed army destroyed more than 500 Palestinian villages and towns. About 15,000 Palestinians were killed, and more than 750,000 were forcibly displaced from their land.
Today's crisis evokes memories of the Nakba for Palestinians in Gaza, many of whom are descendants of those who were uprooted decades ago.
'The BBC has often called the ongoing conflict 'complex'. It is no more complex than any other conflict,' the letter reads. 'It is our job to cut through rhetoric and misinformation; to explain what is happening and what has led to this.'
A BBC spokesperson denied the allegations.
In an email sent to Al Jazeera, the spokesperson said: 'Throughout our reporting on the conflict the BBC has made clear the devastating human cost to civilians living in Gaza and Israel.'
They added that the BBC is 'one of the only news organisations' to have journalists inside Gaza, who have been able to provide 'on the ground reporting'.
'This has included many stories of Palestinian victims and first-hand testimony from civilians, doctors and aid-workers in Gaza, as well as a Panorama documentary, featuring human stories from both sides,' they said.

The spokesperson also sent a list of examples of BBC coverage on the war, which included human stories of Palestinian suffering.
One linked to a documentary on October 23, with the summary: 'Panorama reports on the conflict between Israel and Hamas. After 1,400 Israelis, including women and children were murdered by Hamas fighters, Israel promised brutal retaliation to destroy Hamas. More than three thousand Palestinians, many women and children, have already been killed in Gaza. Reporter Jane Corbin hears the human stories on both sides and asks what does the escalating crisis mean for the wider region?'
Israel has since   the death toll from 1,400 to 1,200.
The summary is an example of the kind of language in Western media outlets that many have criticised, since Israelis are described as being 'murdered by Hamas fighters', but Palestinians are 'killed' by a nameless perpetrator.
BBC beset by controversies amid war
Since the latest Middle East conflict began, the BBC has been beset by controversies and claims of bias.
Last month, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said the broadcaster's descriptions of Hamas fighters as 'militants', rather than 'terrorists', was 'verging on disgraceful'.
Hamas is designated as a "terror" group by the UK, United States and European Union.
At around the same time, the protest group Palestine Action claimed responsibility for vandalising the network's London headquarters with red paint, accusing it of 'spreading the occupation's lies and manufacturing consent for Israel's war crimes'.

Last week, the BBC embedded with the Israeli army to be shown around al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, after Israel took control of the site. Israel has alleged that Hamas operated from the hospital – claims that many observers, including the BBC, have questioned.
Stephen Grey, a Reuters reporter, said on X of the trip facilitated by Israel: 'Media should think very carefully about taking part in any one-sided embeds with any party. Today's BBC report on al Shifa hospital, in which they were unable to speak to doctors or patients, left me feeling deeply uncomfortable.'
On October 24, a BBC correspondent based in Beirut, Rami Ruhayem, wrote to Tim Davie, BBC's director-general, alleging that there are 'indications that the BBC is – implicitly at least – treating Israeli lives as more worthy than Palestinian lives, and reinforcing Israeli war propaganda'.
On October 25, The Times newspaper, citing a BBC source, reported that staff had been 'crying in the toilets' over the 'distress caused' by coverage that they alleged was too lenient on Israel.
And over the weekend, Danny Cohen, a former director of BBC Television, said the corporation should be independently investigated over 'management failures in its reporting of Israel', as he accused a BBC journalist of pro-Palestine bias on her social media feed.
Fallout across global newsrooms
The war has led to bitter divides across other newsrooms, too.
An unnamed reporter at The Guardian, with family in southern Israel, wrote in the Jewish News that they felt disillusioned by the newspaper's coverage and working environment after the Hamas attacks, claiming their colleagues were unsupportive.
'I think that Israel must defend itself. Yet when I say this, people will tell me I am justifying the murder of children. They will tell me it is a genocide,' they wrote.
Anne Boyer, a poetry editor for The New York Times, quit last week, ostensibly over the paper's editorial stance.
Apparently taking aim at the newspaper's language on the war, she said: 'I can't write about poetry amidst the 'reasonable' tones of those who aim to acclimatize us to this unreasonable suffering. No more ghoulish euphemisms. No more verbally sanitized hellscapes. No more warmongering lies.'
Jazmine Hughes, a writer for The New York Times, resigned after signing a solidarity statement that described 'Gaza's people' as 'victims of a genocidal war'.
Journalist and illustrator Mona Chalabi, who works for The Guardian US and freelances for The New York Times, posted on Instagram on October 18 that The New York Times has 'consistently mentioned Israeli deaths more often than Palestinian deaths. What's more, their coverage of Israeli deaths is *increasing* as more Palestinians are dying'.
Meanwhile, at the Los Angeles Times, staffers who signed a protest letter in solidarity with Gazan journalists have been blocked from covering the war for three months, Semafor reported.
According to the BBC's rules on impartiality, editorial staff 'should not participate in public demonstrations or gatherings about controversial issues'.

Israel kills 3 Palestinians in Gaza, West Bank

September 19th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli forces have killed two Palestinians during a raid in the  , and another Palestinian in a separate incident in the blockaded Gaza Strip, as Israel bars entry to thousands of Palestinian labourers from the coastal enclave.
The West Bank raid took place on Tuesday in the Jenin refugee camp, with some 20 others also injured, according to Palestinian health officials. The dead have not yet been named.
In Gaza, the Palestinian man killed was identified as Yousef Salem Radwan, 25. He was shot by Israeli forces east of Khan Yunis in Gaza, reported Palestinian media.
The Israeli military did not confirm the Gaza killing, but said that "rioters" had gathered next to the fence that separates Gaza from Israel, and that "a number of explosive devices were activated by the rioters". The military also gave few details about the deaths in the Jenin, apart from saying that it had carried out a drone strike.
The violence comes after Israel announced late on Sunday that it would keep the Beit Hanoun (Erez) crossing closed following an eruption of border protests and a "security assessment" by defence officials.
"The reopening of the crossing will be subject to ongoing evaluation based on the evolving situation in the region," said COGAT, a unit of the Israeli defence ministry responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs.
The closure of Beit Hanoun, the sole pedestrian passageway out of the enclave into Israel, leaves roughly 18,000 Palestinians from Gaza who have been issued Israeli work permits unable to access their jobs.
The string of protests came during a holiday season in Israel that began with the Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year last week and continues through the Sukkot festival next week.
During the holidays, large numbers of Jews are expected to enter the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, also known to Jews as the Temple Mount, in occupied East Jerusalem's Old City – in the past this has meant restrictions on Palestinian access to the holy site, which is also a Palestinian national symbol.
Gazan officials said medical cases were still allowed to use the crossing, which Israel had been due to reopen Monday following a shutdown due to Jewish holidays.
The extended closure follows repeated confrontations between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces along the border over the past few days.
The confrontations have seen multiple Palestinians wounded after Israeli forces launch gunfire and tear gas at the protesters. The Israeli military also launched an air attack late Friday on the Gaza Strip.
'Collective punishment'
The decision to block the entry to Israel was condemned as "illegal collective punishment" by the Israeli NGO Gisha, which advocates for Palestinians' freedom of movement.
The move is "harming Gazaworkersand their families, as well as other permit holders who need to travel for humanitarian needs," Gisha said in a statement.
One of the Gazans affected, Kamal, said he and fellow workers "have nothing to do with the security situation in Gaza."
"Closing Erez costs my family and me our food and living expenses," said the 41-year-old construction worker, who gave only his first name for fear of reprisal from the Israeli authorities.
Palestinians have far higher earning power in Israel than Gaza, where salaries are low and unemployment is rife.
Ashraf, 36, expressed the same concerns as he described the closure as "collective punishment against workers".
"We only want to work and live," said the permit holder.
An employee at a restaurant in Jaffa called on the Israeli authorities to "compensate for the days of work lost" due to the border closure.
Israel has maintained a strict land, air and sea blockade on the Gaza Strip since 2007, when Hamas seized power of the coastal enclave.
There have been multiple wars fought between Gaza-based armed groups and Israel in recent years.
Violence against protesters
Hamas has said the protests in Gaza have been a response to Israeli provocations, citing an increase in the number of far-right nationalist Jewish activists entering the Al-Aqsa compound.
On Monday, Israeli forces   at Bab as-Silsila, one of the main entrances to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem.They also denied access to any Palestinian below the age of 50 to clear the way for Israeli settlers on Rosh Hashanah.
'As long as these provocations continue, the protests will continue,' said Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasem.

Nablus, occupied West Bank - Dunya Ghanem stood over her son's body in disbelief.
"Come on, Jihad, my love. Get up. Let's go home," she coaxed him in the morgue on Monday morning, caressing her slain son's face.
She put her hand on his heart. 'Jihad's alive. His heart is beating,' she insisted to the dozens of family and friends who had come to console her.
'Just be patient for God's sake,' she told them. 'Jihad is just asleep.'
She grabbed hold of him as the medics tried to move his body into the morgue refrigerators, pushing their hands away and crying out: 'He's not dead! He'll be cold in there!'
When her protests failed and it was time to bury 29-year-old Jihad Saleh, Dunya carried her son on her shoulders, leading the pallbearers, who were all men.
Dunya struggled to speak about her son as she cried. "I was dreaming of seeing him get married," she choked out.

Jihad and 17-year-old Mohammad Qasim Abu Zar were killed by the Israeli army during a raid on the village of Zawata in the northern West Bank on Sunday night.
More than 20 Israeli military vehicles entered Zawata, west of Nablus city, precipitating confrontations during which the army fired live ammunition and tear gas at youth.
At least three people were injured, including one who remains in critical condition.
Hundreds of people attended Jihad's funeral procession on Monday.
'He loved life'
Israeli forces have killed at least 95 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and injured more than 1,800 since October 7, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
On that day, the armed wing of Hamas, the group that governs the besieged Gaza Strip, launched attacks on Israeli territory. More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed.
Israel responded with a relentless bombing campaign on Gaza that has persisted for the past 17 days, killing 5,087 Palestinians there to date, including 2,055 children and 1,119 women, while more than 15,200 people have been injured.
In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the Israeli army has   on Palestinian neighbourhoods, villages and cities since October 7. Killings of residents by armed settlers have also increased.
The escalating violence has sparked daily protests and confrontations against Israeli forces at checkpoints, military bases and settlements.
Jihad's cousin Wa'ed Ghanem, 19, said Jihad used to be a labourer in Israel but had recently left his job and set up a coffee cart in his village.
"He was a simple person. He loved life. But after his cousin and closest friend, Omayr, was killed, he became a different person," she told Al Jazeera.
Omayr Lolah, 19, was shot by the Israeli army in February and   in March.
A total of 11 Palestinians were killed and more than 100 injured in the brutal Israeli raid on Nablus on February 23.
"Jihad stopped going out, stopped working, stopped being able to go on with his life after Omayr was killed," Wa'ed Ghanem said.
Losing friends and family to Israeli raids is something most young people in the occupied Palestinian territory experience, the loss and trauma often scarring them for life.
Losing her child left Dunya unable to do much more than huddle in the arms of her relatives, but she said she was proud she could take him to his final resting place.

Western leaders accused of hypocrisy over response to Palestine, Ukraine

After Saturday's surprise attack by the   on Israel, Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy took to the social media platform X to offer "condolences go out to everyone who lost relatives or close ones in the terrorist attack".
He also stated, "Israel's right to self-defence is unquestionable".
Many world leaders, including US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, shared similar sentiments.
The world is seeing appalling images.
Thousands of rockets raining down on Israeli cities. Hamas terrorists killing not only Israeli soldiers, but civilians on the streets and in their homes.
It's unconscionable. Israel has a right to defend itself - full stop.
- President Biden (@POTUS) October 7, 2023
The President of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, stated, "Israel has the right to defend itself – today and in the days to come. The European Union stands with Israel".
Accusations of western 'double standards'
Some social media users have criticised these statements, saying they highlight a double standard.
Ukraine's right to defend itself is praised by most international leaders while Russia's invasion is condemned, but commentators said the same cannot be said about Israel's 56-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
Aaron Bastani, a leftist British journalist, said on X that there's a "clear double standard in endorsing terrorism against civilian targets in Ukraine … and condemning it by Palestinians".
There's clear double standard in endorsing terrorism against civilian targets by Ukraine (which one can obviously argue is justified – they face occupation) & condemning it by Palestinians.
Those fighting our enemies = war of liberation
Those fighting our allies = terrorism https://t.co/t1G3gQ7HnP
- Aaron Bastani (@AaronBastani) October 7, 2023
Many users said Western diplomats and media support the Ukrainians who defend their land, but label the Palestinians fighting against Israel as "terrorists".
So, Ukrainian civilians defending their families are 'freedom fighters'
But Palestinians in Gaza doing the EXACT same thing are 'terrorists'?
- Khaled Beydoun (@KhaledBeydoun) October 7, 2023
An illustration of a woman's face, in which one eye is closed beside a Palestinian flag, and one eye open beside a Ukrainian flag, has been regularly shared as a symbol of the West's alleged double standards in how the two conflicts are viewed.
The international community's double standards are evident as they rally for Ukraine's conflict with Russia while turning a blind eye to the enduring suffering of the Palestinian people under Israeli apartheid for decades. #AlAqsaFlood pic.twitter.com/tgdgOabuLC

Clips also emerged on social media from a CNN interview with Mustafa Barghouti, the general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, in which he posed the rhetorical question, "why the United States support Ukraine in fighting occupation? While here they support the occupier, who continues to occupy us".
If this were Ukraine, US, EU and UK politicians would be falling over themselves in condemning a war crime. Which is exactly what this is. https://t.co/3057uOGVE2

The hypocrisy and double standards of western governments and media platforms dealing with situations in Ukraine-Russia and Palestine-Israel blow the mind. Absolute disgrace.
- Said Yacoubi (@AlyacoubiSaid) October 8, 2023
An existing debate re-ignited
It is not the first time Western nations have been accused of double standards in their stance on the Ukraine war.
Earlier in the year, Amnesty published a report highlighting the West's 'double standards' on global human rights.
Agnes Callamard, Amnesty's Amnesty secretary-general, told Al Jazeera at the time that   of the Palestinians was a 'particularly important one'.
'Without making any comparison between Russia's aggression and Israel it is clear the Palestinian people are under a regime of oppression. A regime of occupation and a regime of apartheid,' Callamard told Al Jazeera.
Over the last three days, X users recirculated earlier statements calling out what they called Western hypocrisy, sharing video by the Irish lawmaker Richard Boyd Barrett from March 2022 in which he berated the Irish government's double standards regarding Ukraine and Palestine.
"You're happy to use the most strong and robust language to describe the crimes against humanity of Vladimir Putin, but you will not use the same strength of language when it comes to describing Israel's treatment of the Palestinians".
Barrett on Sunday again called out what he called "shocking double standards of Western leaders supporting Ukraine resistance but condemning Palestinian[s]."

Meanwhile, others warned against comparing conflicts.

And some cautioned that Hamas and Palestinians should not be seen as one and the same.
Just to clarify:
Palestine did not mount an attack on Israel. An Iranian proxy militia did. Palestinians are by and large huddled in their homes praying that an Israeli airstrike won't kill them or theirs. Hamas is the culprit here. This isn't a decentralized grassroots thing.
- Romeo Kokriatski (@RomeoKokriatski) October 9, 2023
 
Ukrainian footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko, who plays for Arsenal, posted on Instagram stating he "stands with Israel".
Zinchenko has been a vocal supporter of his home country in its ongoing defence against Russia and participated in a Game4Ukraine charity match in London earlier this year to raise money for Ukraine.
After online backlash, with some questioning an alleged double standard in his support of Israel, the footballer removed the post and switched his social media account to private.
Several people claimed his football club, in not responding to Zinchenko's comments, were guilty of hypocrisy after they had distanced themselves from former player Mesut Ozil's comments in 2019 over alleged human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in China.

Palestinians in some areas of Khan Younis say they have received evacuation orders from the Israeli military amid fears that Israel could intensify its assault on southern Gaza.
Residents in Khuzaa, Abassan, Bani Suhaila and Al Qarara in eastern Khan Younis, the biggest city in southern Gaza, were showered with thousands of leaflets dropped by Israeli aircraft overnight and early on Thursday, warning them to leave.
The towns, collectively home to more than 100,000 people in peacetime, are now sheltering tens of thousands more who have fled other areas after Israel ordered residents of northern Gaza to evacuate to the south.
"For your safety, you need to evacuate your places of residence immediately and head to known shelters," the leaflets said. 'Anyone near terrorists or their facilities puts their life at risk, and every house used by terrorists will be targeted.'
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the leaflets.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the besieged territory of 2.3 million people have fled south as Israel intensified its  .
It was not clear where residents in eastern Khan Younis were expected to flee as Israel continues its bombardment in areas in the south where Palestinians were previously ordered to relocate for their safety.
'We have been absolutely clear that at the current moment, we do not consider any part of Gaza to be safe,' UN High Commissioner for Human Rights   said on Thursday.
As Israeli forces continue their ground assault in the northern part of Gaza, aid organisations have warned of a   in the densely packed south as Israel's bombardment and siege severely restricts supplies of food, water, fuel and electricity.
Turk said the conditions make outbreaks of infectious disease and extreme hunger nearly inevitable.
Many of those who have been displaced by the fighting – about 70 percent of Gaza's population, according to the UN – worry that they will not be allowed to return home.
Israel has said that it is working to eliminate the armed Palestinian group  , which launched deadly attacks on southern Israel on October 7, which killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 captive, according to Israeli authorities,
Israel has responded with an assault on Gaza that has killed at least 11,470 people, more than one third of them  , according to Palestinian authorities.
The dropping of the leaflets on Khan Younis came as Israeli forces raided the  , the largest medical facility in Gaza.
The situation at the hospital has raised alarm around the world with hundreds of patients and thousands of displaced civilians trapped inside without fuel, oxygen or basic supplies.
Medics said dozens of patients had died in recent says as a result of Israel's siege, including three newborns in incubators that lost power.
Israel has said the hospital sits atop a large Hamas command centre, but it has yet to   to validate its assertion after conducting raids inside the hospital that were met with alarm from medical organisations and political leaders.
On Thursday, the human rights group Human Rights Watch said Israel has yet to provide sufficient evidence to justify revoking the hospital's protected status under the international laws of war.
"Hospitals only lose those protections if it can be shown that harmful acts have been carried out from the premises,' Human Rights Watch UN Director Louis Charbonneau told the Reuters news agency.
'The Israeli government hasn't provided any evidence of that."

Israeli forces kill Palestinian, wound eight, in occupied West Bank raid

Israeli forces have shot dead a Palestinian man during an incursion in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
Mahmoud Jarad, 23, was shot in the chest as Israeli soldiers raided the Tulkarem refugee camp, in the northern occupied West Bank early on Friday morning. Israeli soldiers reportedly fired live ammunition and tear gas canisters, and stationed snipers on the rooftops of the camp's residents.
Jarad was taken to Thabet Thabet Hospital, and was pronounced dead.
Amin Khader, the director of the hospital, told Palestine TV that at least eight people were wounded.
The Fatah party, which dominates the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank, said Jarad was a member but it did not claim him as a fighter.
For its part, the Tulkarem Brigade which is affiliated with the armed military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, said in a press release that it "responded to the Israeli incursion into the Tulkarem camp, with armed clashes and improvised explosive devices".
There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian health ministry or the Israeli military.

On Thursday, Israeli forces   who was wanted by the army for months during a raid near the city of Nablus.
Violence in the occupied West Bank has worsened over the past 15 months amid stepped-up Israeli raids, rampages by illegal Jewish settlers on Palestinian villages and Palestinian street attacks.
A United Nations tally showed at least 196 Palestinians and 24 people in Israel have been killed in hostilities since January. According to Wafa, the number of Palestinians killed this year is at least 220.
Israel subjects millions of Palestinians to military rule in the West Bank, which it occupied during the 1967 War. It has continued to build settlements, considered by most countries as illegal, which it disputes.
United States-brokered peace talks aimed at establishing a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem collapsed in 2014 and show no sign of resuming.
Some 40,700 Palestinians are registered with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in two camps in the Tulkarem area. They are Palestinian refugees, or their descendants, who were forced out by Zionist paramilitary groups or fled their homes in the run-up to Israel's creation in 1948.

What's happening with normalising ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel?

September 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
For months, Saudi Arabia and Israel – with the United States – have been discussing an agreement to normalise relations.
The US has made it clear that official relations between its two allies in the Middle East is a top priority, with top diplomat Antony Blinken declaring it a "  ".
This comes amid a regional realignment after Iran and Saudi Arabia   after years of animosity.
On Wednesday, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS)  : "Every day we get closer" to a normalisation deal with Israel.
So what are Saudi Arabia's conditions for normalisation?
Riyadh wants a US defence pact – including fewer restrictions on US arms sales to it – and assistance in developing its own civilian nuclear programme.
It also said any deal would require major progress towards the creation of a Palestinian state, which is a hard sell for the most religious and far-right nationalist government in Israel's history.

Saudi Arabia has been a big proponent of the 2002  , which conditions normalisation with Israel on its withdrawal from Palestinian territory and Syria's Golan Heights.
The initiative also includes the establishment of a Palestinian state as well as finding a 'fair solution' to the plight of the millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, most of whom live in refugee camps in neighbouring countries.
What did Israel say?
On Thursday, Israel's foreign minister struck an optimistic tone, saying he expects a deal to be reached soon.
"The gaps can be bridged," Eli Cohen told Israel's Army Radio."I think there is certainly a likelihood that, in the first quarter of 2024, four or five months hence, we will be able to be at a point where the details [of a deal] are finalised," he added.
Israeli PM Netanyahu and U.S. President Biden discussed Saudi-Israel normalization on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
Under your leadership Mr. President, we can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Netanyahu said pic.twitter.com/vRA74sHJKk
- Sprinter (@Sprinter99800) September 20, 2023
Saudi Arabia's desire to build a nuclear programme does not seem to be an obstacle. Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel's national security adviser, said in July: "Dozens of countries operate projects with civilian nuclear cores and with nuclear endeavours for energy. This is not something that endangers them nor their neighbours."
However, Netanyahu's government, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, has rejected "concessions" to the Palestinian Authority (PA) government as part of normalising relations, including a settlement freeze in the occupied West Bank.
How has the Palestinian Authority reacted?
In a bid to win over the PA, Saudi Arabia has offered to resume financial support to it after aid dropped to zero in 2021.
According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, a delegation of PA officials last month went to Riyadh to press for their own set of conditions in exchange for acquiescing to Saudi Arabia normalising ties with Israel.
The conditions include the reopening of the US consulate in occupied East Jerusalem, which former US President Donald Trump closed in 2019. The PA has also asked the US to back full Palestinian representation at the United Nations.
Other conditions include Israel giving the PA more control over some parts of the occupied West Bank and getting rid of illegal Israeli outposts.
This has been a far cry from how the PA reacted when Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates announced normalisation with Israel in 2020. At the time, the PA accused the Gulf states of stabbing it in the back.
What has Iran said?
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisihas warned Saudi Arabia against making any deal with Israel.
At a news conference, also in New York on the fringes of the UN General Assembly, Raisi told Sky News such a deal would be a "stab in the back of the Palestinian people and their resistance".
"Under no circumstances are the regional countries willing for the Islamic countries to abandon the sacred principle of the plight of the Palestinian people because the liberation of the holy city of Jerusalem is at the core of the belief of all Muslims," he said.

Hamas leader accuses Israel of 'barbaric massacres' after refugee camp hit

November 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Hamas's political leader has accused Israel of carrying out 'massacres' in the besieged Gaza Strip to conceal its own 'defeats' and warned that the hundreds of Israeli and foreign hostages being held captive in Gaza faced the same risk of 'death and destruction' from the Israeli assault on the territory as Palestinian residents.
Israel is 'committing barbaric massacres against unarmed civilians", Ismail Haniyeh said in an address broadcast on Wednesday
"Its villainy will not save them from resounding defeat," he promised.
Israel launched an assault on Gaza on October 7 after Hamas carried out a devastating attack on southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials.
At least 8,796 people have been killed in the continuing Israeli bombardment of Gaza, including 3,648 children, according to Palestinian authorities.
Haniyeh said Hamas had warned Israel's 'fascist government' about its 'contentious policies' before its attack, pointing to the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and attacks on Islamic holy sites, such as the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
The Hamas leader said regional unrest would continue until "Palestinians obtain their "legitimate rights to freedom, independence and return".
Refugee camp hit
The remarks came after Israeli forces  the Jabalia refugee camp in north Gaza for the second straight day, killing dozens, according to Palestinian officials.
More than 50 people were killed in an Israeli air raid on the densely packed neighbourhood the previous day, Palestinian authorities said.
Hamas said seven Israeli hostages, three of whom held foreign passports, were killed in the attack.
Hamas's military wing has previously said that "almost 50" hostages had been killed in previous Israeli air raids on the besieged territory.
Israel's military confirmed it attacked the Jabalia refugee camp, Gaza's largest, saying the air raid on Tuesday had killed senior Hamas member Ibrahim Biari, along with many other 'terrorists.' Biari was responsible for helping to orchestrate the October 7 attack, Israel said.
UNICEF warning about child deaths
The UN's children's fund has said that the toll of the Israeli assault was having a devastating impact on children in Gaza.
'More than 420 children are being killed or injured in Gaza each day — a number which should shake each of us to our core,' said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.
Hamas leader Haniyeh also said the bloodshed must stop and called on the world to continue rallying in defence of the Palestinian cause to pressure policymakers.
He accused Israel and its ally the United States of blocking mediation efforts.
On Friday, the US and Israel were among only 14 out of 193 UN member countries to   on the general assembly resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian truce. However, 120 countries voted 'yes' to the resolution, while 45 abstained.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly dismissed  calls for a ceasefire, saying it would be tantamount to 'surrendering' to Hamas. The main Palestinian armed groups fighting in Gaza, including Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, have not called for a ceasefire.

This week, as the British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly rushed to visit and support Israel after Hamas's unprecedented attacks, Braverman urged British police to consider whether chanting phrases such as 'from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free' could be treated as 'racially aggravated' crimes.
Writing to chief constables of England and Wales on Tuesday, she reaffirmed the British government's support of 'legitimate Israeli defensive measures' and its commitment to protecting Britain's Jewish community from 'anti-Semitic abuse'.

The latest Israel-Hamas crisis has resonated across the United Kingdom, and reignited old tensions between supporters of Israel and those who condemn the occupation and advocate for Palestinian rights.
Many pro-Palestine campaigners say that over the years, they have increasingly been condemned as anti-Semitic, claiming accusations of anti-Jewish racism are   to silence them.
Referring to Israel as an apartheid regime, advocating for the rights of Palestinians and rising up against Israeli occupiers have in the past been seized on by pro-Israel commentators as examples of anti-Semitism.
According to Shawish, pro-Israel campaigners have 'weaponised anti-Semitism', and he knowsseveral activists who are 'terrified' of the label.
The Glasgow resident, who told Al Jazeera that it was 'painful to see the loss of life on both sides', lamented 'that the Western media only shows interest in our part of the world when Israelis are killed and targeted'.
'Our advice is always to remain objective and focused on verified and publicly available information and always ensure that we do not conflate the Jewish people with Israel,' he said.
'Israel is a state and is not beyond criticism.'

Saturday's   in Israel by Hamas - the armed group that has controlled the impoverished Palestinian territory of Gaza since 2007 - took the world by surprise.
Israel has accused the group of killing hundreds of civilians, including children, and taken many hostage in Gaza. The Palestinian group denies deliberately targeting civilians but admits taking several people captive.
Israel responded to the attacks with fury, bombarding Gaza relentlessly, and imposing a total blockade on the already besieged strip. It is widely expected that its promised ground invasion of Gaza will begin within days.
More than 2,800 people have been confirmed killed in less than a week, a toll that includes Palestinians, Israelis and some foreigners.
The war has stirred a sense of Palestinian solidarity across some sections of society in Britain, which, during its days of empire, held colonial sway over Palestine for some three decades prior to the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948.
On Monday, thousands of pro-Palestinian activists massed in London, where the bulk of the UK's Arab and Jewish populations live.
This came just 24 hours after Israel, which is deemed an apartheid state by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch on account of its occupation of the Palestinian West Bank and its blockade of the Gaza Strip, responded to Hamas's audacious assault by declaring war on the Palestinian group.

'The Palestinian struggle is inherently anti-racist in nature,' Leanne Mohamad, a 23-year-old British-Palestinian human rights activist based in the capital, told Al Jazeera.
'Opposing Israel's severe actions against Palestinians and opposing anti-Semitism are not mutually exclusive principles.'
She described an 'increasingly hostile environment today' for activists and observers, 'where one cannot guarantee that expressing their views will not lead to attacks, fuelled by the dangerous conflation of anti-Semitism with the constitutional order of the State of Israel.
'This conflation of course poses a grave threat to the fundamental rights of Palestinians to articulate their lived experiences and the rights of others to advocate on their behalf.'
Like Shawish, she also plans to attend a pro-Palestine demonstration this weekend, in London.
"We must persist in our battle against injustice, not solely for the sake of Palestine but for the cause of humanity, for the preservation of human rights, and as a stance against supremacy, racism and imperialism," Mohamad said.
"It is so important that we collectively continue speaking up and continue protesting all the governments that are encouraging this unimaginable atrocity."

But Chris Doyle, director of the London-based Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU), said both sides have used inflammatory language - in the past and during this current crisis.
'Some genuine anti-Semites had decided to hop on the Palestinian rights movement' for their own nefarious ends, he told Al Jazeera.
'Anti-Arab and anti-Muslim rhetoric' were also apparent among some supporters of Israel, he said.
Doyle cited the 'appalling' comments made by Richard Ferrer, editor of Britain's Jewish News, who wrote in a UK newspaper that Hamas's assault on Israel was 'plain and simple historic Islamic bloodlust, passed down through the generations from birth'.

As battle lines were drawn on social media, there Jewish schools in the UK stepped up their security to guard against potential anti-Semitic attacks against pupils.
The Community Security Trust, a charity that monitors anti-Semitism, said anti-Jewish incidents had risen since Hamas's assault.
Between October 7 and 10, it said, there were at least 89 incidents, compared with 21 over the same four days in 2022.
"In many cases, the perpetrators of these disgraceful incidents are using the symbols and language of pro-Palestinian politics as rhetorical weapons with which to threaten and abuse Jewish people," the group alleged.
Separately, the Muslim Council of Britain warned that it was"crucial we do not allow these tensions to affect our communities here in the UK. There is the risk that at times like these both Islamophobia and anti-Semitism rise.
"We must be proactive to ensure that this is not the case and our communities can come together for the common good.'

What is Hamas? A simple guide to the armed Palestinian group

Israel and the armed Palestinian group Hamas are locked in an escalating conflict that has left almost 1,000 people dead in a little more than a day.
On Saturday, Hamas   attack on Israel, blowing up parts of the country's highly fortified separation fence and sending fighters into Israeli communities along the Gaza frontier.
The move prompted the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to warn of 'a long and difficult war". Israeli jets are bombing the Gaza Strip, levelling high rises and civilian neighbourhoods.
But what is Hamas, the group at the centre of it all? Here is what to know:
What is the group Hamas?
Hamas stands for the Islamic Resistance Movement and in Arabic means 'zeal'.
The group politically controls the Gaza Strip, a territory of about 365sq km (141sq miles) that is   to more than two million people but is blockaded by Israel.
Hamas has been in power in the Gaza Strip since 2007 after a brief war   loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
When was Hamas formed and what is its aim?
The Hamas movement was founded in Gaza in 1987 by an imam, Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, and his aide Abdul Aziz al-Rantissi shortly after the start of the first Intifada, an uprising against Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories.
The movement started as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and created a military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, to pursue an armed struggle against Israel with the aim of liberating historic Palestine.
It also offered social welfare programmes to Palestinian victims of the Israeli occupation.
What are the Palestinian group's principles?
Unlike the PLO, Hamas does not recognise Israel's statehood but accepts a Palestinian  .
'We shall not waive an inch of the Palestinian home soil no matter what the recent pressures are and no matter how long the occupation,' Khaled Meshaal, the leader-in-exile of the Palestinian group said in 2017.
Hamas violently opposes the Oslo peace accords negotiated by Israel and the PLO in the mid-1990s.
It is formally committed to establishing a Palestinian state within its own borders.   this aim through attacks on Israeli soldiers, settlers and civilians both in the occupied Palestinian territories and in Israel.
The group as whole or in some instances its military wing is designated as a "terrorist" organisation by Israel, the United States, European Union, Canada, Egypt and Japan.
(Al Jazeera)
Who are its allies and supporters?
Hamas is part of a regional alliance that also includes Iran, Syria and the group Hezbollah in Lebanon, which opposes US policies towards the Middle East and Israel.
 , the second-largest armed group in the region, are often united against Israel and are the most important members of the joint operations room that coordinates military activity among the various armed groups in Gaza.
The relationship between the two groups has been tense when Hamas has exerted pressure on Islamic Jihad to stop attacks against Israel.
What prompted Saturday's attack on Israel?
Hamas   told Al Jazeera that the group carried out its military operation in response to atrocities that Palestinians have faced over decades.
"We want the international community to stop atrocities in Gaza against Palestinian people, our holy sites like Al-Aqsa [Mosque]. All these things are the reason behind starting this battle,' he said.
Hamas also called on other groups to join the fight, saying Saturday's attacks were just the beginning.
Is Hamas targeting civilians?
Osama Hamdan, senior spokesperson for Hamas, told Al Jazeera that the group was not attacking civilians even though the group's own videos have shown its fighters taking elderly Israelis hostage during the fighting on Saturday.
Rights groups such as Amnesty International have also pointed out that Israeli civilians had been killed by Hamas.
But Hamdan insisted that the group was attacking only settlers living in illegal settlements, whom he described as legitimate targets.
'You have to differentiate between settlers and civilians. Settlers attacked Palestinians,' Hamdan said.
Asked whether civilians in southern Israel were also considered settlers, Hamdan said: 'Everyone knows there are settlements there.'
'We are not targeting civilians on purpose. We have declared settlers are part of the occupation and part of the armed Israeli force. They are not civilians,' he added.
How was the group able to carry out the attack?
Hamas said its fighters took several Israelis captive in the enclave, releasing videos of fighters dragging bloodied soldiers. It said senior Israeli military officers were among the captives.
The videos could not immediately be verified but matched geographic features of the area. Fears that Israelis have been kidnapped evoked memories of the 2006 capture of soldier Gilad Shalit, whom Hamas-linked fighters seised in a cross-border raid. Hamas held Shalit for five years until he was exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Hamas also sent paragliders flying into Israel, the Israeli military said. The attack recalled a famous assault in the late 1980s when Palestinian fighters crossed from Lebanon into northern Israel on hang-gliders and killed six Israeli soldiers.

'No ceasefire': Israel supporters gather in Washington, DC, amid Gaza war

November 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - Jeers erupted at a pro-Israel rally in Washington, DC, when political analyst Van Jones called for the   to stop.
Jones had condemned anti-Semitism and voiced support for Israel in his remarks to the March for Israel, a demonstration that brought tens of thousands of protesters on Tuesday to the National Mall, a park in the heart of the United States capital.
But it was Jones's proclamation that he was a "peace guy" that drew rumbles from the crowd.
"I pray for peace — no more rockets from Gaza and no more bombs falling down on the people of Gaza. God, protect the children," he said.
The initial boos against him quickly turned into chants of "no ceasefire". The crowd had gathered to back Israel's war in Gaza and to call for the release of more than 200 captives held by the Palestinian group Hamas.
On October 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing more than 1,200 people. In response, Israel has led a military offensive against Gaza, a small, densely-packed Palestinian strip that is home to 2.3 million people. More than 11,000 Palestinians have died.
Tuesday's demonstration follows a major protest by Palestinian rights advocates in Washington, DC,  .
But this march drew top members of the US Congress from both major parties, including the Speaker of the House of Representative   and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, both of whom addressed the crowd.
"The calls for a ceasefire are outrageous," Johnson said. His statement was met with more chants of "no ceasefire", this time approvingly.
Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke at the rally as well. So did John Hagee, a right-wing Christian pastor who has been accused of stoking both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.
Hagee came under fire in 2008 after an old sermon resurfaced in which he described Nazi leader Adolf Hitler as a 'hunter' sent by God to push Jewish people to move to Israel.
The administration of President Joe Biden was also represented at the rally by Deborah Lipstadt, the US envoy to combat anti-Semitism.
The broad ideological spectrum at the protest highlighted the US's   for Israel.
"Bring them home," the protesters chanted, referring to the captives in Gaza, as they waved Israeli and American flags.

Leading rights groups have accused Israel of violating international law during the war and attacking civilian targets, including  , hospitals and schools housing displaced people. United Nations experts have also warned of the risk of genocide  against the Palestinian people.
When asked about the casualties in Gaza, many demonstrators expressed sympathy for Palestinians, but they blamed Hamas for the violence, accusing the group of using civilians as "human shields".
Many held signs proclaiming Israel's boundary from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. The messages aimed to counter the slogan, "From the  , Palestine will be free" — something Palestinian rights supporters consider an aspirational call for freedom and equality.
Al Jazeera spoke to some of the protesters at Tuesday's event. Here's what they had to say:
Stu Weiss: 'What occupation?'
Stu Weiss, a protester from New Jersey, held a sign saying that the 1,200 Israelis killed on October 7 would amount to 48,000 Americans relative to the size of the population.
Weiss said his message aims to make people think about the scale of the atrocities committed by Hamas. He added that Hamas is also responsible for the Palestinian deaths in Gaza, claiming that the group prevented people from fleeing south.
In reality, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced from the north of Gaza, and Israel has continued to bomb southern towns where it told residents to go. An estimated one out of every 200 Palestinians in Gaza has died.
Weiss said that, by the end of the conflict, he would like to see "Hamas gone and Israelis living in peace with the Palestinian people".
"They're taught to hate Jews and Israel," he said of Palestinians. Asked whether Israel's occupation of Gaza contributed to hostility  , Weiss responded, "What occupation?"

James McLaughlin: 'They're coming for us next'
James McLaughlin, a demonstrator from Philadelphia, said there can never be a ceasefire until Israel destroys Hamas.
"They're coming for the Jews. And they're coming for us next — all of Western civilisation. So as a bulwark, Western civilisation is the bedrock of my faith. I totally stand with Israel," McLaughlin told Al Jazeera.
He displayed a sign that read, "Christians stand with Israel."
Rima: 'Israel is our land'
Rima, a protester who chose to identify by her first name only, carried a large green placard saying, "From the river to the sea, Israel is all you'll see."
"Israel is our indigenous land, and it's always going to be ours. This is where Jews come from. They were there before Arabs. They were there before anyone else," Rima told Al Jazeera.

Evan: 'Hard to imagine a good outcome'
Evan, a demonstrator who also wanted to be identified by his first name only, waved a large Israeli flag and stressed that Hamas started the war.
He voiced support for what he called Israel's "right to defend itself". Still, he expressed a grim outlook for the future as he reflected on what would happen after the current conflict.
"It's hard to imagine a good outcome, no matter what. Israel has probably created another generation of people who will hate them. And that's a consequence of war. Anyone who's lost a parent, a child, a loved one, a cousin — killed in a thing — cannot be expected to embrace or forgive," Evan said.
"It's unfortunate. But I can't sit here and say to Israel, 'You have to get out now.'"
Minna Shezaf: Conflict is 'terrifying'
Minna Shezaf, a demonstrator from Washington, DC, who has lived in Israel, said she was at the rally to express solidarity with Israel and praised Biden's handling of the crisis as "admirable".
Shezaf added that the conflict could take a "terrifying" turn if the armed group Hezbollah gets further involved in the war.
The Lebanese group has been   on Israeli troops almost daily in support of Gaza. Israel, in turn, has been retaliating by bombing areas across its shared border with Lebanon.
Asked about the mounting death toll in Gaza, Shezaf said, "It's terrible what Hamas is doing to the people of Gaza. It's a human rights violation."

Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt disrupted by Israeli air raids

Operations at the Rafah crossing on the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt have been temporarily disrupted due to the   of the besieged Palestinian enclave.
The news agency Reuters reported that the sole   between Egypt and Gaza was partially closed on Monday, citing three Egyptian security officials and a witness.
Reuters reported that two sources said the crossing has since fully reopened with two others saying it has only reopened for humanitarian cases.
The report was filed as Israel carries out a relentless bombardment on the tightly packed Gaza Strip, whose 2.3 million residents are bracing themselves for escalating Israeli assaults. Israel has blockaded Gaza since 2007, leaving Palestinians living there with 
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant   a 'complete siege' of Gaza, cutting off access to water, electricity, food and fuel. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said he was "deeply distressed" by the announcement.
"While I recognise Israel's legitimate security concerns, I also remind Israel that military operations must be conducted in strict accordance with international humanitarian law," Guterres said.
The continuing Israeli bombardment follows a   by the armed wing of the Palestinian group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip. Hundreds of Hamas fighters entered Israel from Gaza on Saturday in a multifront attack, killing more than 800 Israelis and wounding thousands of others.
Gaza's Ministry of Health has reported that 687 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli air raids with 3,276 injured since Saturday.
The Red Crescent has delivered some medical aid to Gaza through the Rafah crossing.
Reuters reported that Egyptian authorities have asked Israel to refrain from targeting the border area and to create a safe corridor for civilians, citing two security sources.
A spokesperson with Gaza's Health Ministry said on Monday that Israeli strikes have targeted hospitals and medical crews and called for a corridor to allow the delivery of medical supplies, depleted by Israel's 16-year blockade, to the coastal enclave.
'We ask that a [humanitarian] corridor is opened to allow medical supplies to reach hospitals in the Gaza Strip,' the spokesperson said, warning that the situation in Gaza's medical facilities is critical.

US wants an Israeli-Saudi 'normalisation' deal. Why now?

August 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC – The United States has made establishing diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel a   – a push that experts say would leave Palestinians behind and could come at a high price for Washington in the Middle East.
The complexity of Washington's so-called normalisation drive also has raised questions around why US President Joe Biden's administration has made it a priority right now.
"Biden belongs to a school of thought that views the Arab-Israeli conflict as one in which Palestinians are not necessarily the central force," said Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think-tank.
"He believes that the underlying root cause of this conflict is the inability of Arab states to accept Israel. And so, if that's how you view the conflict, it would make sense that you would prioritise normalisation," Elgindy told Al Jazeera.
Last week, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman laid out  a complex plan that he said Biden is pursuing to secure an Israeli-Saudi deal. It involves giving Saudi Arabia   guarantees and helping the Gulf kingdom kick-start a civilian nuclear programme.
The framework would not directly involve the Palestinians, Friedman reported, but it would include some concessions to them, such as an Israeli settlement freeze and a pledge from Israel to never annex the occupied West Bank.
While Friedman regularly meets with Biden, his account has not been officially confirmed by the US government. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have previously reported, however, that Riyadh is seeking a security pact from Washington and a nuclear programme as part of any normalisation agreement with Israel.
'Normalisation'
Despite not commenting on the specifics of a prospective deal, US officials have declared unambiguously that   an Israeli-Saudi agreement.
Israeli leaders also have made no secret of their aspiration for formal ties with Riyadh: "We pray for this moment to come,"   said in a speech to the US Congress last month.
For its part, Saudi Arabia has not officially changed its policy in support of the  , which conditions recognition of Israel on establishing a Palestinian state and finding a 'fair solution' to the plight of Palestinian refugees.
Still, Saudi officials have not entirely ruled out the prospect of a deal with Israel.
Last year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the country views Israel as a "potential ally", but he stressed that Israel "should solve its problems with the Palestinians", who have so far been largely absent from the normalisation campaign.
"We believe that normalisation is in the interest of the region, that it would bring significant benefits to all," Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said during a joint news conference with his US counterpart Anthony Blinken in June.
"But without finding a pathway to peace for the Palestinian people, without addressing that challenge, any normalisation will have limited benefits. And therefore, I think we should continue to focus on finding a pathway towards a two-state solution, on finding a pathway towards giving the Palestinians dignity and justice."
Few Arab states have recognised Israel since its inception in 1948, but former US President Donald Trump's administration helped secure agreements for formal relations between Israel and the   and Morocco in 2020 – known as the "Abraham Accords". Sudan also agreed to normalise relations with Israel as part of Trump's push.
Despite that, Israel has not significantly altered its policies on Palestinians, which leading rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and  , say amount to apartheid.
In fact, in recent months, the far-right government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has intensified settlement expansion and   on Palestinian communities in the West Bank.
This has raised questions among experts around whether the Israeli government, which   who want to further enshrine Israel's control of the occupied Palestinian territories, would agree to a settlement freeze or a pledge against annexation – even if it comes with official Saudi recognition.
"I don't think this Israeli government is capable of   – even on paper – for Palestinians because they're committed to the dismantling of the entire Palestinian national idea," Elgindy said.
The Palestinian issue
Aside from questions over  's willingness to agree to such concessions, a Saudi-Israeli deal also faces other potential obstacles. Public opinion polls , for instance, show that Saudi citizens do not support recognising Israel.
Anna Jacobs, a senior analyst for the Gulf states at the International Crisis Group think-tank, said Saudi Arabia will likely need to take its citizens' views into account.
"For Saudi Arabia to seriously consider moving forward with normalization with Israel, several conditions need to be met, one of which is some sort of progress on revamping the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process," she told Al Jazeera in an email.
"It would be difficult for Saudi Arabia to legitimize the decision to normalize relations with Israel, which isn't popular among the Saudi public, without showing some benefits for Palestinians."
But for many Palestinians, the demands outlined by Friedman on annexation and settlements are crumbs they say are meant to give a cover of legitimacy to the potential deal.
"If Saudi Arabia and Israel want to get together, don't make this about Palestinians; it's not," said Palestinian-American analyst Yousef Munayyer.
Security pact
Still, many states in the Middle East have joined the US-led "Abraham Accords" in pursuit of their own interests, drawing the ire of   the deals are a "stab in the back".
As reported by several American media outlets, Saudi Arabia is pushing for its own concessions from the US should it officially recognise Israel – namely formal security guarantees from Washington.
But that would pose another hurdle for the normalisation push, experts have said.
Any treaty with Riyadh would require the approval of at least two-thirds of the legislators in the US Senate, which could prove difficult given the rise of voices on Capitol Hill that are critical of Saudi Arabia, as well as of further US military involvement in the Middle East.
Jon Hoffman, a foreign policy analyst at the CATO Institute, a libertarian think-tank based in Washington, DC, also said a codified US security pact with Saudi Arabia would risk destablising the region shortly after Riyadh and Tehran  .
The details of such an arrangement between Washington and Riyadh remain unclear, but Friedman reported that the Saudi government is seeking a "NATO-level mutual security treaty". The US has a defence pact with NATO countries, meaning it would be obligated to come to their defence if they are attacked.
"This is not worth it at all. If Biden goes through with this, I think this will be the worst foreign policy decision in the Middle East since Iraq," said Hoffman, referring to the 2003 US-led invasion of the country.
The Saudi embassy in Washington, DC did not respond to Al Jazeera's requests for comment by the time of publication.
Why now?
While recognition by Saudi Arabia would be significant for Israel, analysts say   between the two countries also would be a foreign policy win for Biden as the 2024 US election season goes into full swing.
And while average American voters may not base their votes on  , Arab-Israeli normalisation remains popular among both major parties in Washington, DC.For example, in 2020, many Democrats who loathed Trump praised the "Abraham Accords".
"US electoral politics helps explain why the Biden administration is pursuing this normalization deal so publicly and intensely at this time," said Jacobs."In the realm of US domestic politics, Saudi-Israel normalization would be a foreign policy win for the Biden administration."
But Jacobs added that a deal would "do little to improve the plight of Palestinians or improve broader regional security".
That was echoed by Munayyer, who told Al Jazeera that Israeli normalisation with Saudi Arabia and other Arab- and Muslim-majority countries will not change the reality    or the conflict as a whole.
"The Israelis are not going to be any closer to resolving the fundamental problem of ruling over millions of Palestinians who don't want to be ruled by Israel, and who want to have freedom and justice and equality," he said.
"You can normalise and have relations with every Arab and Muslim country, that's not going to change that fact."

US Capitol police clash with protesters calling for Gaza war ceasefire

Police in riot gear have clashed with demonstrators calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war outside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, DC.
Protesters, many wearing shirts that read "Cease Fire Now', linked arms in front of the DNC building's entrance near the Capitol on Wednesday night, where some sang: "Which side are you on?"
Officers pushed and pulled the protesters to try to remove them from the area, at one point shoving one protester down a staircase leading to the entrance. Police also used pepper spray and fired projectiles containing chemical irritants.
Demonstrator Dani Noble said people came to the DNC to peacefully call on Democratic Party leadership to support a ceasefire in Gaza.
Instead, "we were met by police pulling on folks that are disabled or have chronic illnesses, pulling people to the ground in riot gear", Noble said.
"It is shameful the way that nonviolent protesters and members of our community were met with violence tonight. It is absolutely shameful," he added.
Capitol Police said approximately 150 people were "illegally and violently protesting". It said six officers were treated for injuries, ranging from cuts to being pepper sprayed and punched.
"One person has been arrested for assault on an officer," Capitol Police said on social media.
The protest organisers rejected allegations that the demonstrators were violent.

Police escorted legislators who were at the DNC offices at the time out of the building to safety.
Congressman Sean Casten said: "We were rescued by armed officers who did not know the protesters' intent; they knew only that members of Congress were inside, could not leave and that protesters would not let police through."
The demonstration was organised by three advocacy groups, and included members of IfNotNow, a group that urges US Jewish groups to end their support of Israel's policies towards the Palestinians; Jewish Voice for Peace, a group that advocates for Palestinian independence; and the Democratic Socialists of America.
Jewish Voice for Peace wrote on social media that the protesters had gathered to lay out candles for Palestinians killed during Israel's bombardment and to call for a ceasefire.
Last week, a large number of House Democrats joined nearly all Republicans in voting to censure Representative  , the only Palestinian American in Congress, over her criticism of the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians.
Public demonstrations – both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel – have rippled around the world since October 7, when Hamas launched an attack in Israel that killed 1,200 people, and Israel began a non-stop bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 11,300 Palestinians, about 40 percent of them children.
Wednesday's pro-ceasefire demonstration came a day after many thousands of   gathered on the National Mall, holding placards with words like: "Let Israel finish the job", 'From the river to the sea, Israel is all you'll see', and calling for 'no ceasefire' to take place.

US rights group urges colleges to protect free speech amid Gaza war

Washington, DC - A prominent civil rights group in the United States has urged colleges and universities to respect free speech and resist calls to investigate or disband student organisations rallying on behalf of Palestinian rights.
In an open letter to academic institutions on Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned against politically motivated efforts to police speech on campus, which could "destroy the foundation on which academic communities are built".
The letter comes amid heightened tensions in US academia, as the Israel-Hamas war enters its 26th day. Some campuses are reporting pressure to crack down on critics of Israel's   in Gaza, where an estimated 8,796 Palestinians have been killed.
"A college or university, whether public or private, cannot fulfill its mission as a forum for vigorous debate if its leaders initiate baseless investigations into those who express disfavored or even loathsome views," the ACLU letter reads.
"Such investigations chill speech, foster an atmosphere of mutual suspicion, and betray the spirit of free inquiry, which is based on the power to persuade rather than the power to punish."
Threats to university funding
Since   on October 7, debates about the conflict have intensified on college campuses.
Republican politicians have targeted Israel's critics at universities, going as far as threatening to withhold federal funds if campus administrators do not contain Palestinian rights activism.
Senator Tim Scott, a Republican candidate in the 2024 presidential race, has introduced legislation  to "rescind federal education funding for colleges and universities that peddle antisemitism", citing a Palestinian literature festival at the University of Pennsylvania as an example.
And the State University System of Florida called for the public institutions under its control to dismantle  chapters of the advocacy group Students for Justice in Palestine (SPJ), citing alleged links to "terrorist groups".
The decision, the state university system said, was made in consultation with Florida Governor  , another Republican presidential contender.
The Anti-Defamation League and the Brandeis Center, two pro-Israel groups, also issued a joint letter to universities this week, calling for probes into Students for Justice in Palestine.
"We call on university leaders to immediately investigate their campus SJP chapters regarding whether they have improper funding sources, have violated the school code of conduct, have violated state or federal laws, and/or are providing material support  , a Foreign Terrorist Organization," the ADL letter said.
It also warned that if universities fail to "check the activities of their SJP chapters, they may be violating their Jewish students' legal rights to be free of harassment and discrimination on campus".

ACLU denounces call for probes
On Wednesday, the ACLU specifically rejected the ADL's call for "sweeping investigations" into student organisations.
The group acknowledged that the war in Gaza has "roiled campuses across the country" and led to a rise in threats and  .
Many Palestinian rights advocates have complained of intimidation tactics, public shaming and being doxxed, a practice by which their personal information is disseminated publicly, often online.
Some students also fear their career prospects could be threatened if they speak out. For example, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, published a Wall Street Journal op-ed last month titled Don't Hire My Anti-Semitic Law Students, referring to student activists who oppose Zionism.
Jewish students have also reported anti-Semitic incidents, including violent online threats at Cornell University, a prestigious Ivy League school. On Wednesday, police arrested  21-year-old Cornell student Patrick Dai over posts that threatened to kill and rape Jewish people.
The ACLU said that while it does not take sides in overseas conflicts, it does "strongly oppose efforts to stifle free speech, free association, and academic freedom here at home".
"In the name of those principles, we urge you to reject calls to investigate, disband, or penalize student groups on the basis of their exercise of free speech rights," the letter said.
The ACLU also decried the Florida university system's decision to deactivate its SPJ chapters.
"In the absence of any indication that these student organizations have themselves engaged in unlawful activity, or violated valid university policies, both the First Amendment and bedrock principles of academic freedom stand firmly against any attempts to punish them for their protected speech and associations," the ACLU said.
"We urge you to hold fast to our country's best traditions and reject baseless calls to investigate or punish student groups for exercising their free speech rights."

'We saw death': Egyptian nationals trying to leave Gaza stuck at Rafah

Gaza Strip – It was a long-awaited family reunion. In October, Reem Rasmi travelled from her home in Egypt to the Gaza Strip to visit her sister's family after five years. Her nephew was getting married, and it was time to celebrate.
A month later, the 55-year-old is stuck in the besieged enclave, displaced by the war that broke out on October 7 and that has prevented her from being able to return to her husband and children back in Egypt. For Rasmi, an Egyptian national, the dilemma is doubled: Even if she does manage to cross over at the  , she will need to leave her sister's family behind, amid unrelenting bombing from Israel.
"I was supposed to leave on October 10, and I'm still waiting," she said. "I have never experienced war like this before, with explosions everywhere. I can't even describe the level of terror we're in."
Rasmi and her sister's family were forced to flee from the sister's home in the al-Zaytoun neighbourhood east of Gaza City to another relative's house in the southern city of Khan Younis because of the bombardment. She said her husband and children are constantly asking her about whether she has heard anything from Rafah border officials on when she can cross. She has no firm answer for them.
"My children are consumed by fear and anxiety, and I cannot reassure them and tell them I'm fine because they watch the news on TV," she said. "The images show the horror and displacement of people in this war. Sometimes even I cannot comprehend what is happening."

The Rafah crossing is the   for Palestinians and foreign nationals. It has been repeatedly bombed by Israel and is completely shut to those who wish to enter Gaza from the Egyptian side.
Egypt has said that it would help secure the evacuation of about 7,000 foreigners and dual nationals from the Gaza Strip. On  , the border crossing for exiting was finally opened after several weeks, but only for the evacuation of foreigners and dual nationals, and the coordinated transfer of dozens of  .
A daily list names those from Gaza who have been allowed to leave. The list is vetted by Israel. Hundreds of people who have flocked to the crossing over the past week have been stopped from exiting. Among them is Rasmi.
"I am living the most difficult days of my life under bombardment," she said. "Luck is not on my side."
'We have the right to leave'
An estimated 50,000 dual nationals living in the Gaza Strip hold both Palestinian and Egyptian citizenship, according to Alaa al-Din Obeid, a member of the Egyptian community cultural centre in Gaza.
"There are 8,000 Egyptian women married to Palestinians, and these mothers can pass on their citizenship directly to their children but not to their husbands," Obeid said, speaking from Rafah.
Palestinians with an Egyptian grandmother can also gain Egyptian citizenship through court orders, he added.
Obeid said that before the war, the Egyptian community cultural centre was in the process of gathering information for an updated census.
"This is why it's hard to know exactly how many Egyptian Palestinian dual nationals managed to leave through Rafah," he said, saying that the number is estimated at 300.
On the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, some Palestinian Egyptians are questioning whether Egyptian authorities are doing enough to help them leave.
Khalida Hassan said she and her four children have been waiting at the crossing since it opened more than a week ago.
"We saw death with our own eyes," the 45-year-old said. "Every day we hand over our passports and our bags get taken and we wait to cross to the Egyptian side, but they keep closing the border and return our bags and documents."
"We all hold foreign passports so there should not be a difference between having an Egyptian or US passport," she added.
Hassan, who has lived in Gaza all her life, said her house was bombed and she was forced to flee south, where there is no water or electricity.
"When will I leave Gaza? Are they waiting for me and my children to die here? We all have the right to leave the crossing," she said.
Those who have managed to cross the border have mixed emotions.
Mohammed Dahman, 36, holds an Egyptian passport and was finally able to leave through the Rafah crossing last week with his pregnant wife and two children.
"I left my home in the Rimal neighbourhood in Gaza City which held all my memories with my family and under the bombardment fled to Khan Younis to stay with my friends," he said. "The idea of being displaced is hard to take, as I did not want to leave the city that I love."
Dahman decided to leave because he saw how much his young children were suffering.
"When you as a father can't offer your children comfort and security, you have to make the difficult decision to leave," he said. "My children would not stop trembling in my arms when I'd hold them at night."
Dahman and his family made their way to the Rafah crossing every day for a week, waiting for long hours before returning to Khan Younis, defeated. Travelling to and from Rafah was a danger in itself, and he had difficulty finding a willing driver to take his family there with each passing day.
Eventually, the Dahman family were able to cross into Egypt, where they are now staying in Cairo.
"It's not an easy thing to be in a safe place and [to be] constantly worrying about those you left behind under the bombing," he said. "I hope we can return to Gaza soon and for everyone I know back there to survive."

Israel doubles number of Palestinian prisoners to 10,000 in two weeks

October 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Ramallah, occupied West Bank – Israel has arrested so many Palestinians in the two weeks since the start of its bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip that it has doubled the number of Palestinians in its custody.
There were about 5,200 Palestinians in Israeli prisons prior to October 7 when the Palestinian armed resistance group   launched an attack on Israel, which responded almost immediately with a relentless bombing campaign.
The number of prisoners has now risen to more than 10,000 people, Palestinian officials said  on Thursday afternoon.
Over the past two weeks, according to officials and rights groups, Israel has arrested some 4,000 labourers from Gaza who were working in Israel and is holding them in military bases. Separately, it has also arrested 1,070 other Palestinians in overnight army raids  in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
'Arrests are taking place 24 hours a day,' Sahar Francis, head of the Ramallah-based Addameer prisoners' rights group, told Al Jazeera.
Most of the people from Gaza are being held at a military base called Sde Teyman, near Beer al-Sabe (Be'er Sheva) in the southern Naqab desert, she said.
Hundreds of others are being held in Ofer prison near Ramallah, and in the Anatot military camp near the village of Anata in occupied East Jerusalem.
Palestinian lawyers and officials have highlighted the severe mistreatment and dire conditions under which detainees are being arrested and held.

'Dangerous' prison conditions
At a press conference on Thursday afternoon in Ramallah, head of the Palestinian Authority's Commission for Detainees' Affairs Qadura Fares, said recent developments regarding prisoners are "unprecedented" and "dangerous".
"We hesitated a lot about holding this press conference addressing yet another chapter of Israeli crimes, on what our male and female prisoners are being exposed to in the occupation's prisons, for fear of creating tension and anxiety among the families of prisoners, and our Palestinian people in general," said Fares.
"Prisoners are subjected to starvation and thirst; they are prevented from accessing their medicine, specifically for those suffering from chronic illnesses that require regular medication," he said, adding that matters became worse "when the prison administration cut off water and electricity".
Addameer also reported  the prevention of access to medical care. 'They also shut down the prison clinics, and also prevented prisoners from going to hospitals and external clinics, despite the presence of some cancer patients among the prisoners who require continuous treatment," said the rights group.
"The most dangerous thing" over the past few days, continued Fares, was "physical attacks" and degrading treatment. 'Everyone who is arrested is assaulted.
"Many of the prisoners have had their limbs, hands and legs broken … degrading and insulting expressions, insults, cursing, tying them with handcuffs to the back and tightening them at the end to the point of causing severe pain … naked, humiliating and group search of the prisoners,' he said.

'Cut off from the world'
Aside from the 4,000 residents of the Gaza Strip, most of whom are held at the Sde Teyman military camp, about 6,000 Palestinians are imprisoned in Israeli jails and detention centres.
The 5,200 jailed before October 7 are largely residents of the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
But in the past two weeks, the Israeli army arrested another 1,070 Palestinians during overnight military raids in those areas.
During periods of "calm" under Israel's 56-year military occupation, 15-20 people are arrested on a daily basis. But since October 7 daily the arrest rate of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem has gone up to 120 people, according to Palestinian officials.
The arrests take place through surprise military raids on Palestinian homes at dawn, humiliating searches of family members and their homes, destruction of property and belongings, as well as verbal and physical abuse.
Francis said that Palestinians being held inside Israeli prisons and detention centres are 'cut off from the world'.
'There is no yard time, no contact with their families, no family visits and no regular lawyer visits,' she explained.
Israeli authorities have also  shut off access to canteens, which are necessary to buy basic supplies such as toothpaste, and limited meals to two a day instead of three.
The Israeli parliament, known as the Knesset, on Wednesday approved a plan currently effective for three months allowing the reduction of the minimum living space allotted to each prisoner, previously set at 3.5 square metres – to accommodate a rising crush of prisoners.
In a press conference by Palestinian civil rights groups on Tuesday in Ramallah, Addameer called on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to "abide by its responsibilities" as the sole authorised international organisation monitoring the situation of Palestinian detainees, and called on the group to visit them, particularly those from Gaza in military camps.
"We are not seeing any real pressure from the ICRC," Francis told Al Jazeera. "They say that they are trying but Israel is preventing them, but that's not an excuse. Too much time has passed."
Open-ended detention
Israel is using different legal pretexts to withhold the detainees from different areas, according to human rights groups.
Palestinians from the Gaza Strip who were arrested inside Israel are being held under the "Unlawful Combatants Law" which allows  authorities to detain Palestinians indefinitelywithout effective judicial review.
The law defines an 'unlawful combatant' as a 'person who has participated either directly or indirectly in hostile acts against the State of Israel, or is a member of a force perpetrating hostile acts against the State of Israel."
On October 13, Israel amended the law to make it easier to   Palestinians on mere suspicion. Some of the provisions include "expanding the scope of those entitled to issue arrest warrants to include generals and those of lower rank".
The Unlawful Combatants Law  is the equivalent of administrative detention in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, which allows Israel to hold Palestinians from those areas indefinitely under "secret evidence".
Most of the 1,070 people arrested in those areas since October 7 are being transferred to administrative detention, Francis said.
"They are signing off on dozens of administrative detention orders every day," Francis said.
Israel's latest assault on Gaza began on October 7 after Hamas launched a surprise attack just outside the besieged enclave on Israeli territory. So far, at least 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, according to Israeli officials.
Since then, Israel's retaliatory bombardment has killed at least   in Gaza, including 1,524 children, while 81 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank.

Growing up Palestinian after the Oslo Accords

September 13th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Thirty years after the Palestinian Liberation Organisation signed the Oslo Accords , officially recognising Israel, the Palestinian people appear to be no closer to an  , and the occupation of their land looks even more entrenched.
Palestinians under the age of 30 have only known life under the US-brokered deal, which left them with a provisional, self-governing authority –  .
But the supposedly interim government has failed to address major concerns about territory,  , the status of Jerusalem – the eastern half of which remains occupied by Israel – as well as Palestinian refugees and the right of return.
On the 30th anniversary of the signing of the accords, Al Jazeera spoke to seven Palestinians to get their thoughts on the deal, and whether they think their life would have been different without it.
Ola Anebtawi, 32, Nablus, occupied West Bank
Ola is a researcher and the head of the nutrition department at al-Najah University [Al Jazeera]
Growing up, the topic of the Oslo Accords would always come up because of its controversial nature. I always felt lost and I didn't understand how to form my own opinion.
But with time, I saw how it was translated on the ground and realised it was a major setback for our country and for our leadership.
When, as a Palestinian, you become aware of the cause, you start thinking, "How can I play a role - in whatever capacity - in resisting the occupation?"
But Oslo prevented us from reaching our mission as a people. It failed to unite us and to bring back the entirety of the land that was taken, and to facilitate the return of refugees.
By saying, "I recognise Israel as a state", you're normalising. Today, we're blaming the UAE for doing it, but we were the first people who recognised Israel as a state with defined borders.
It was a huge mistake.
The accords have also impacted our lives economically and socially, and restricted our freedom of movement because of the [illegal] settlements.
It's truly hurtful. When you don't have freedom, you have nothing. They robbed us of this.
 
Bahaa, 26, occupied East Jerusalem
Oslo was a complete disaster. It divided Palestinian areas into three sections: A, B, and C, and gave the occupation the power and legitimacy to control and administer these areas.
It intertwined the Palestinian and Israeli economies, making us dependent on it for survival.
The accords also had a massive impact on the youth in Jerusalem as it basically gave Israel complete control over the eastern part of the city.
We see this demonstrated in different ways on the ground - most recently in our education policies and the war waged against it.
We also see how it has created an obstacle and divide between us and Palestinians in the West Bank, and elsewhere [in historical Palestine].
 
Tasami Ramadan, 25, Nablus, occupied West Bank
Tasami is a community activist and says the accords brought divisions among Palestinian factions to the fore [Al Jazeera]
When I think of the Oslo Accords, I think of two words: hope and disappointment.
At the beginning, the accords were a chance for Palestinians to establish their own independent state and free themselves from occupation. But the reality on the ground turned this hope into disappointment.
The state that we were promised was never delivered. In fact, all of the promises that are in the agreement were never implemented. It was an unjust and unfair agreement.
If the accords never existed, I believe we would have had a stronger sense of Palestinian unity.
Oslo really helped bring out divisions among Palestinian factions. The effects of these internal disputes has had a massive impact on Palestinian unity and we're suffering from the consequences to this very day.
These accords have also greatly diminished the importance of resistance and forced people to lose faith in the power of resistance. If it weren't for these accords, I think we would have had stronger and more organised resistance groups, and the idea of resistance would have been a main unifying factor.
The accords have also shut the door on any other avenues that could have helped end the occupation. It basically said: "We signed this agreement, and nothing else can be done."
 
Hossam, 30, occupied East Jerusalem
What we see happening on a daily basis – from assaults and violations on the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and the effort to divide and destroy it – are all products of the Oslo Accords.
These accords have only brought tragedy and heartbreak upon the Palestinian people.
The agreement excluded Jerusalem from being given a final status and historical Palestine remains under occupation. In my opinion, it has got to be denounced.
This agreement fragmented the Palestinian people and separated them through the [separation] wall and settlements. I believe that liberation will never come through agreements signed with the occupation.
 
Saif Aqel, 30, Ramallah, occupied West Bank
Saif is a political activist and says the accords have become a permanent reference for the relationship between the Palestinians and Israel [Al Jazeera]
I think signing the Oslo Accords was a historic mistake.
Even with my current understanding of the regional and international circumstances that prompted the Palestine Liberation Organisation at the time, I think it was a mistake.
Instead of keeping the PA as a temporary body within its specified time frame of five years, these agreements have become a permanent reference for the relationship between the Palestinians and the occupation.
Even 30 years after signing them, the accords have become a benchmark for the PA when putting forward proposals and demands, instead of them being the bare minimum. The evidence for this is that the Palestinian leadership is still demanding that Israel abide by the signed accords.
Meanwhile, successive Israeli governments have backtracked on the agreements and their responsibilities as an occupying power towards the Palestinian people. They went ahead and created a new reality for dealing with the Palestinians in the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza.
This cannot lead to a peaceful solution based on so-called negotiation with the occupation.
 
Jehan, 33, Hebron, occupied West Bank
The Oslo Accords are not peace accords, they are accords containing our defeat.
There can never be peace with the presence of a brutal occupation that controls Palestinian lands.
The accords essentially fragmented and divided Palestine. It gave us a form of self-determination, but the overarching power remains in the hand of Israel. There is coercive Israeli sovereignty that has control over all Palestinian land, and this is what we're witnessing on the ground.
In areas including Hebron, Nablus, Jenin, Ramallah, and others – which are supposedly under the Palestinian Authority's control – we see near-daily incursions and killings carried out by Israeli forces, yet there is zero interference by the PA to stop this.
The accords also denied refugees the right of return and left many integral topics unresolved, such as the status of Jerusalem and the settlement expansion project. How can peace be achieved by postponing such issues?
In my opinion, what was taken by force can only be returned by force and by the resistance.

The Oslo Accords have set a dangerous precedent in our history, not only because it gave up Palestinian land to the occupation, but also because it acquired a legal character in the form of an international agreement.
This legitimises the compromising of rights of an entire population.
The Palestinian leadership was hasty and was taken by the idea of establishing a state at any cost and in whatever form.
Instead, it found itself shackled to severe political, security and economic restrictions that put it in direct conflict with the idea of liberation.
If the accords were never signed, I would have existed in a normal state that occupied people live in - one where I am engaged in a revolution, not in false dreams offered to an occupied people in exchange for their silence.
Even the idea of a two-state solution has become a fantasy because the settlements ate up so much land on which a Palestinian state could be built.

Before Oslo, the Israeli occupation was ruling all of our affairs and our lives. Despite this, people were able to express their constant rejection of it [the occupation], but after our transition to autonomous authority, the Palestinian Authority became a protector of the occupation's presence.
One of the worst outcomes of the accords was that 78 percent of Palestine was given up in exchange for false promises such as establishing an airport, a seaport, an autonomous authority, and stopping settlement activity.
A few years later, the airport in Gaza was completely destroyed, the port was not completed, and settlements continue to eat away at the West Bank to this day.
Because of Oslo, my generation is deprived of visiting the West Bank, the 1948 territories [Israel], Jerusalem, and the rest of the Palestinian territories because of the borders that were demarcated in the agreement.
Today, if I decide to travel, I am forced to go and endure the hardship of travel and inspection through the Rafah border crossing, which is run by Egypt and is infamous for the difficulty of moving through it.
Now, we do not even govern 10 percent of Palestine. Gaza has no future, even after decades. Today we live in a prison and an area full of cement blocks with never-ending crises including poverty, unemployment, a siege, power outages, and on top of that we have endless Israeli assaults.

Mourners in the United States have gathered to honour Wadea Al-Fayoume, a   stabbed to death by a man police say targeted him and his mother because they were Muslim and Palestinian Americans.
The funeral took place on Monday at the Mosque Foundation in Bridgeview, Illinois, a community southwest of Chicago with a large Palestinian population. The suspected attacker, 71-year-old Joseph Czuba, has been charged with murder and hate crimes.
"This is a heavy day. It is a worst nightmare come true. It is something we've tried to warn against," Ahmed Rehab, the executive director of the Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), said on Monday. "It pains me that the sacrificial lamb to this atmosphere was this beautiful young six-year-old boy."
Hanaan Shahin, the boy's mother, was attacked by Czuba after she said they should 'pray for peace' as   are engulfed in the most dire fighting in decades.
Czuba then attacked her with a knife and when she tried to escape by running into the bathroom, he found Wadea and stabbed him 26 times, killing him. Shahin, 32, suffered multiple wounds but is expected to survive.
'We are not animals, we are humans," said the boy's uncle, Yousef Hannon. 'We want people to see us as humans, to feel us as humans, to deal with us as humans.'
A group of attendees chanted, 'Free Palestine'.
Muslim groups have sought to raise alarm over the last two weeks as a war between Israel and the armed Palestinian group Hamas escalates and brings with it an outpouring of   on social media, some of which depicts Palestinians as violent and uncivilised.
"He was a lovely boy. Loved his family, friends. He loved soccer, basketball," CAIR's Rehab told reporters on Sunday. "He paid the price for the atmosphere of hate."
US Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department would open a federal hate-crime investigation into the attack.
"This incident cannot help but further raise the fears of Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities in our country with regard to hate-fueled violence," the statement said.
Jewish groups have also expressed concern that anger at events unfolding in the Middle East could result in them being targeted at home.

What is Gaza Strip, the besieged Palestinian enclave under Israeli assault?

October 11th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Gaza Strip has been   for the past five days in the wake of a deadly attack by the armed group Hamas, and human rights groups are calling it collective punishment of the Palestinian enclave's 2.3 million residents.
Gaza is teetering on the verge of a humanitarian crisis with hospitals overwhelmed with casualties during a complete blockade after Israel intensified its 16-year long siege of the territory.
More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed as Israel promised to avenge the deaths of at least 1,200 of its citizens in Saturday's attacks.
What do we know about Gaza?
With 2.3 million people living on 365sq km (141sq miles) of land, the Gaza Strip is considered one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Its population density of 5,500 people per square kilometre (14,245 per square mile) lies in stark contrast to Israel's at about 400 people per square kilometre (1,035 per square mile).
An overwhelming majority of Gaza's population is young with 65 percent being under the age of 24 and the median age for men and women being 18 years.
Sixteen years of an Israeli land, air and sea blockade has crippled its economy and tightly restricted the movement of its people in and out of the enclave.
Gaza residents need special   to cross into Israel and Egypt. This is usually for urgent medical treatment but is very difficult to obtain.
The enclave also has one of the highest unemployment rates in the world at 45 percent. Access to education and medical treatment is also   after years of Israeli air strikes on schools and hospitals.
Palestinians and activists call it the world's largest   due to the Israeli blockade.
Muslims form the majority of the population, and there is a tiny minority Christian community.
More than 60 percent of Gaza's people are refugees from what is currently Israel. More than750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homes by Israeli militias in 1948 when Israel declared its independence.
[Al Jazeera]
What does the total siege mean?
On Monday, Israel announced a   of Gaza, which includes a ban on food, water, fuel and electricity supplies.
Most of Gaza's electricity comes from Israeli power lines, and some is produced at a power plant in Gaza, which also sources its fuel from Israel.
Internet connectivity in the area has slumped since Saturday, according to data from NetBlocks.
Israeli has mobilised   around the strip for a possible ground invasion. Israel last invaded Gaza in 2014.
Where is Gaza located?
Gaza, a 10km (6 mile) by 41km (25 mile)   located on the Mediterranean Sea, is one of two Palestinian territories, the other being the occupied West Bank.
It takes one hour to drive from its southern point, Rafah, to Beit Hanoon in the north.
The enclave is divided into five governorates: North Gaza, Gaza City, Deir el-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah.
Gaza is separated from Israel by a separation barrier, and it has a southern border crossing with Egypt.
(Al Jazeera)
Who controls the Gaza Strip?
Gaza is viewed as an occupied territory because Israel has full control of its borders, airspace and territorial waters despite having formally withdrawn its forces and settlers from the enclave in 2005. Israel had captured the enclave along with other Palestinian territories – East Jerusalem and the West Bank – in the 1967 Six-Day War.
The Gaza Strip's current boundaries were demarcated in the Egyptian-Israeli armistice agreement of February 24, 1949. Until 1967, Gaza was under Egyptian control.
In 2006, Hamas won elections against the Fatah party, which runs the Palestinian Authority (PA). The group took over Gaza after months of fighting with Fatah in 2007. The PA, which signed the 1993 Oslo Accords with Israel, governs the West Bank.
Hamas and other Palestinian resistance groups based in Gaza have carried out attacks against Israel before, triggering bloody Israeli assaults on the territory.
Since 2005, Israel has carried out at least   in Gaza with 2014 being the most brutal. More than 2,000 Palestinians were killed in the seven-week Israeli assault.
(Al Jazeera)
What's the latest conflict about?
Hamas, which does not recognise Israel and wants an independent Palestine based on the 1967 borders, is demanding that Israel end the enclave's blockade and stop its occupation of Palestinian territories.
Israel has continued to expand settlements in Palestine in violation of the 1993 Oslo Accords, which Hamas did not sign. Palestinians fear the possibility of their own future state is fading due to settlement expansion.
The rise of extreme right politicians and settler violence in recent years have raised tensions. Palestinian groups based in Gaza have retaliated with rockets, triggering episodic violence with Israel. The far-right government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has further stoked tensions with his pro-settler politics.
Even before Saturday's violence erupted, more than 200 Palestinians had been killed this year by Israeli forces –  . Since then, at least 1,055 more Palestinians have been killed, and 1,200 Israelis have died as of the   of the fighting.

French intel says Palestinian rocket likely cause of Gaza hospital blast

France's military intelligence agency has concluded that a misfiring Palestinian rocket was the likely cause of the  , as Israel and Palestinian officials trade blame over the blast.
The Directorate of Military Intelligence (DRM) said on Friday that an errant Palestinian rocket with an explosive charge of about 5kg was the likely cause of the blast and none of its intelligence pointed to an Israeli missile strike.
The DRM said the size of the explosion was consistent with rockets used by the Palestinian group Hamas and the impact crater was too small to have been caused by an Israeli missile.
"There is nothing that allows us to say that it is an Israeli strike but the most likely [scenario] is a Palestinian rocket that had a firing incident," a senior French military official told reporters on condition of anonymity.
The DRM did not offer an estimated death toll but said it was likely lower than the 471 fatalities reported by Palestinian officials.
The official said the assessment was based on classified information, satellite imagery, intelligence shared by other countries and open-source information, including images showing light structural damage at the hospital and relatively few civilian belongings at the blast site.
French President Emmanuel Macron directed the DRM, which does not typically make its work public, to share its findings amid conflicting accounts of who carried out the attack.
The French intelligence assessment adds to a flurry of claims and counterclaims about the hospital blast, which has sparked  .
Palestinian officials have blamed the explosion on an Israeli airstrike, while Israel has said it was caused by a rocket fired by the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which has denied responsibility.
An investigation by Al Jazeera, based on video footage, has cast doubt on Israeli statements that a flash captured in a live news broadcast was caused by a misfiring rocket that hit the hospital.
The United States's National Security Council said earlier this week that its 'current assessment' was that Israel was not responsible for the explosion.
Gaza's health ministry said 471 people were killed in the blast, a death toll Israel said has been deliberately inflated.
US intelligence agencies have estimated the number of victims to be between 100 and 300 people.
On Friday, the United Nations called for an independent investigation into the explosion.
"There is a clear need for an investigation, an independent investigation into what happened," Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office, said during a news conference in Geneva.
"There needs to be accountability.'

The fruits of Palestine and their symbolism

What do watermelons, oranges, olives and eggplants all have in common?
Yes, technically, they are all fruits. Maybe you think they're all delicious. But for Palestinians, they symbolise Palestinian culture and identity.
In protest, agriculture, cuisine and literature, Palestinians use watermelons, oranges, olives and eggplants to represent national identity, connection to the land and resistance.
Watermelons

The watermelon is perhaps the most iconic fruit to represent Palestine. Grown across Palestine, from Jenin to Gaza, the fruit shares the same colours as the Palestinian flag - red, green, white and black - so it's used to protest against Israel's suppression of Palestinian flags and identity.
Following the 1967 war, when Israel seized control of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and annexed East Jerusalem, the government   in the occupied territory.
Although the flag has not always been banned by law, the watermelon caught on as a symbol of resistance. It appears in art , shirts, graffiti, posters, and of course the ubiquitous watermelon emoji on social media.
Recently, the flag has come under fire again. In January 2023, the far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir instructed police to   from public places. This was followed in June by a bill to ban the flag in state-funded institutions, which Haaretz  reports received preliminary Knesset approval.
In response, Zazim, a grassroots Arab-Israeli peace organisation, placed the Palestinian flag - in watermelon form - on about a dozen Tel Aviv service taxis.

'If you want to stop us, we'll find another way to express ourselves,' says Amal Saad, a Palestinian from Haifa who organised Zazim's watermelon campaign.
Saad was unsure whether the right wing would try to stop her, so she kept her planning under the radar. However, Saad said the support she received was overwhelming, with more than 1,300 activists donating to the cause.
Grassroot donations allowed Zazim to keep the watermelons up for two weeks, a week longer than was originally planned, and the campaign has now shifted to distributing watermelon shirts.
Oranges
Ghassan Kanafani wrote about the anguish of a family in the Nakba, forced to leave behind all they every knew and 'all the orange trees that [they] had abandoned' [File: Abid Katib/Getty Images]
The Jaffa orange, which originated in the 19th century, gained prominence for its sweetness and thick, easy-to-peel skin, which made it well-suited for shipping.
Before  , or catastrophe, of 1948 when the creation of Israel led to the expulsion of more than 750,000 Palestinians from villages and towns that their ancestors had lived in for centuries, Jaffa oranges were an important export for Palestinian farmers and businessmen.
Because of their prominence, the oranges also became a symbol of national identity in literature and art. Palestinian novelist and journalist   used oranges to symbolise loss in his 1958 short story about the Nakba, called The Land of Sad Oranges.
The story begins with the narrator and his friend, both young boys, observing their family on the eve of the Nakba. The families pack what they can, but they are forced to abandon 'the well-tended orange trees that [they] had bought one by one'.
The fact that these trees were carefully nurtured over a long period of time indicates the strong connection between Palestinian farmers and the land, which hundreds of thousands were forced to forsake during the Nakba.
Jaffa oranges were an important export for Palestinian farmers and businessmen [File: Baz Ratner/Reuters]
The last contact the narrator has with Palestine before entering Lebanon is a peasant selling oranges along the road. Amid the sound of his family weeping, he picks up a few oranges and brings them into Lebanon – a memento to 'all the orange trees that [they] had abandoned to the Jews'.
In Lebanon, life is very hard for the refugees, in particular for his friend's father. The story ends after the narrator witnesses his friend's father having a mental breakdown. Next to the crying, shivering grown-up, the narrator 'saw at the same moment [a] black revolver … and beside it an orange. The orange was dried up and shrivelled.'
The revolver, a symbol of death, is connected to the shrivelled orange by the narrator's gaze. Forcibly displaced from the 'land of oranges', the narrator realises the extent of the Palestinian people's loss.
Olives

Olive trees can be found across Palestine and are a symbol of resistance. Nour Alhoda Akel, a 23-year-old Palestinian from the Ara valley, believes olive trees are associated with Palestinian identity because, like the orange trees in Kanafani's story, they represent Palestinians' deep-rooted connection to their land.
'Olive trees can live for hundreds of years,' says Akel. 'So if the tree outside my house is 100 years old, I have an automatic connection with it', referring to the land on which the tree stands.
Every year during the olive harvest, Akel joins her extended family to pick olives from their grove, a family heirloom.
'The whole family goes out and everyone helps,' says Akel. After a week of picking, they make olive oil and cure the olives, enough to last the family until next year's harvest.

For other Palestinians, the olive harvest is an  . In addition to the oil, which Akel says is an essential ingredient in Palestinian cuisine, olives are used in cosmetics and soap.
In recent years, Palestinian olive trees have come under attack by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. According to the UN, more than 5,000 olive trees belonging to West Bank Palestinians were vandalised in the first five months of 2023.
In previous years, settlers attacked Palestinians during the olive harvest, which normally falls in October and November. On one day alone in October 2021,   that settlers uprooted 900 olive and apricot saplings, and stole olive crops in the village of Sebastia, north of Nablus.
Eggplants
For Edward Said, eggplants were a way to connect with Palestine, despite living most of his life as an exile [File: Abid Katib/Getty Images]
In Edward Said's photonovel on Palestinian identity, called After the Last Sky, he devotes a few pages to eggplants, in particular those from Battir.
Battir is a UNESCO World Heritage Site  known for eggplants. It even periodically hosts an eggplant festival.
For Said, eggplants are a way for him to connect with Palestine despite living in the United States. He lived most of his life as an exile. At the time of writing this book, Said was still a member of the PLO, so Israel barred him from entering his homeland.
Said recounts that his family was particularly attached to the Battiri eggplants.
So much so that even 'during the many years since any of us had Battiri eggplants, the seal of approval on good eggplants was 'They're almost as good as the Battiris,'' he writes.

Israeli forces kill three Palestinians after alleged West Bank attack

Three Palestinians have been killed after allegedly carrying out a shooting attack at an Israeli checkpoint near Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank.
At least six members of the Israeli security forces were wounded in the attack, one critically, Israeli police said on Thursday.
Following the incident, the Israeli army sealed off all entrances to the Bethlehem governorate in the south of the occupied West Bank, preventing people from entering and exiting the area.
Troops have been deployed along roads leading to several nearby villages and towns.
Israeli police chief Yaakov Shabtai said the alleged gunmen had planned a much bigger attack.
At least two of the alleged attackers belonged to the   armed group, according to Israel's domestic security service Shin Bet.
There was no immediate comment from Hamas.
Shabtai told reporters the three arrived in a vehicle from the direction of Bethlehem and opened fire when Israeli forces there began questioning them. They were killed when the Israeli forces shot back, he said.
After the gunfight, police said they found two automatic rifles, two handguns, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, 10 fully loaded magazines and two axes on the suspects and in their vehicle.
Footage on social media, shot from inside a bus, showed a man in uniform running and falling as gunshots rang out at the checkpoint in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
'They [Israeli authorities] say there is a fourth Palestinian they believe is involved in the shooting,' said Al Jazeera's Nida Ibrahim, reporting from Ramallah.
'In the hours that followed, we've seen Israeli forces raiding Hebron because they believe the perpetrators are from there,' she said. 'They have arrested the families of the three Palestinians".
Earlier on Thursday, Israeli forces carried out raids across the West Bank, making several arrests.
Witnesses told the Palestinian news agency Wafa that two young men were arrested in the city of Jericho. Two other men were arrested following a separate raid on the village of al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya, located south of Nablus.
Tensions in the West Bank   since Hamas carried out a surprise attack on southern Israel last month, killing around 1,200 people, according to the Israeli authorities.
Israel responded with an air and ground assault on Gaza that has so far killed more than 11,600 people, including at least 4,700 children, according to Palestinian health authorities. It has also left much of the besieged enclave in ruins.
At least 197 Palestinians, including 48 children, have been   in the خccupied West Bank since October 7 in deadly   on Palestinian cities and towns. Several Palestinians have been killed in attacks by Israeli settlers, which France's foreign ministry spokesperson Anne-Claire Legendre today called a 'policy of terror' aimed at displacing Palestinians.
Since October 7, 139 homes have been demolished, while more than 2,700 have been arrested across the West Bank, according to Palestinian advocacy groups.

Thousands of Gaza workers go 'missing' in Israel amid wartime mass arrests

October 28th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Thousands of workers from Gaza, who were employed in Israel when the war started, have gone missing since then amid a campaign of  .
Human rights groups and trade unions believe some of the workers have been illegally detained in military facilities in the occupied West Bank, following the revocation of their permits to work in Israel. Authorities in Israel have so far refused to release the names of those they are holding.
When the Palestinian armed group, Hamas, launched an unprecedented assault on the south of Israel on October 7, about 18,500 residents of Gaza held permits to work outside the besieged strip. The exact number of workers present in Israel as hostilities began remains unknown, but thousands are thought to have been rounded up by the Israeli army and transferred to undisclosed locations.
Walid*, a Palestinian worker born in Gaza, had lived in the occupied West Bank for more than 25 years when Israel launched its   of Gaza which has so far killed more than 7,000 people and has lasted for three weeks. On October 8, he was arrested as he headed for work and detained in a facility in the Almon area, also known as Anatot, built on the ruins of the Palestinian town of Anata that Israel confiscated in occupied East Jerusalem.
The facility, human rights organisations say, is among those repurposed by the Israeli government to hold hundreds of workers in arbitrary detention, in breach of international law.
Walid, whose real name and personal details are being withheld to avoid reprisals, described being kept in a "cage" without a roof, under the sun and without food, water or access to the toilet for three days, according to a written testimony given to the Israel-based human rights organisation HaMoked and seen by Al Jazeera.
He was then moved to an area of about 300 square metres where hundreds of labourers shared a chemical toilet cubicle. When he asked to contact the Red Cross, he was cursed and beaten up by soldiers.
Walid was released after Israeli officers ascertained that, although he was born in Gaza, he is a resident of the West Bank. His testimony is among the few accounts to have so far emerged from the detention centres where Gaza workers have been held incommunicado and without legal representation since October 7.
Not clear 'where, how many, under what legal status'
'We have been receiving hundreds and hundreds of phone calls from family members of people who were working in Israel prior to the [October 7] attacks,' Jessica Montell, executive director of HaMoked, told Al Jazeera.
So far, Montell says, more than 400 families and friends of missing people have got in touch with the organisation, trying to trace their loved ones as they simultaneously struggle to survive Israel's bombardments and "total" siege. Those calls have been dwindling in the past week as residents of Gaza are increasingly cut off from communications.
As part of its work, HaMoked regularly submits the names of detainees to the Israeli authorities to find out where they may be held.
'The Israeli military is supposed to inform us within 24 hours of who they are holding, which location they are being held in,' Montell said. 'But for all those Gazans, they told us [they]'re not the right [authority to] address.'
'It can't be the case that it's not clear where they're being held, how many are being held, under what conditions, under what legal status,' she added.
A group of six local organisations, including HaMoked, have petitioned Israel's High Court to disclose the names and locations of the detainees and to ensure humane holding conditions.
According to the petitioners, some of the Palestinians have been detained in the Almon area – where Walid was detained – as well as in Ofer, near Ramallah, and in Sde Teyman, near Beer al-Sabe (Be'er Sheva), in the southern Naqab or Negev desert.
Once the hostilities began and the Beit Hanoun crossing (known as Erez to Israelis) into northern Gaza was shut, workers attempted to make their way to the West Bank to find shelter among Palestinian residents.
But on October 10, Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) revoked all work permits it had previously issued to Gaza residents, instantly turning permit-holders into 'illegal aliens'.
Al Jazeera contacted the Israeli army, as well as COGAT, the body that controls the permit system in the occupied territories. Both declined to comment or provide further information on the number of workers whose permits were revoked, as well as how many have been imprisoned and on what grounds.
'Unparalleled'
Miriam Marmur, advocacy director of Gisha, an Israeli human rights organisation which calls for the freedom of movement of Palestinians, said the situation was 'unparalleled'.
'Of course, at any given point, there are thousands of Palestinians that are being held in administrative detention by Israel,' she told Al Jazeera. 'But these are the first Palestinians to be held en masse. The nature of their detention, the revocation of people's permits and the fact that Israel is so far refusing to divulge any information about where they are … that is not something I have seen before,' she said.
Marmur added that the arrests were "illegal and appear to be acts of vengeance which stand in violation of international law'.
Hamas seized at least 224 people as hostages as it waged its attack on southern Israel on October 7, according to Israeli officials. Four have since been released.
According to Walid's testimony, one of the officers at a detention camp told detainees there would be no chance of them being released as long as there were Israeli hostages in Gaza.
'This isn't an official statement, but certainly it's an indication that, at least to some of the people involved in this, there is a kind of desire to use these workers as bargaining chips,' Marmur said.
Under Israel's permit system, very few Palestinians from the Gaza Strip can leave the territory, as all border crossings have been under Israeli or Egyptian control since Hamas took power in 2007.
Permits can be issued for work, health and humanitarian reasons after careful vetting by the Israeli authorities. Most of the workers from Gaza – where the overall unemployment rate is 45 percent and youth unemployment has soared to 70 percent – take up manual jobs in Israel, where the pay is several times higher.
Human rights groups are concerned about further arrests amid   in the West Bank, including in areas nominally under the full control of the Palestinian Authority.
'We never had a situation like that, where people are trapped and can't go home, and are put in a sort of camp,' said Hassan Jabareen, the director of Adalah, the legal centre for Arab minority rights in Israel. 'These were just workers. The only comparison is perhaps with [undocumented] refugees.'
Mass arrests
The Minister of Labour for the Palestinian Authority estimated that about 4,500 workers are unaccounted for and are believed to have been detained by Israeli forces. Israeli media outlet N12 reported that 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza were being interrogated in Israeli holding facilities over their possible involvement in the attack.
Alongside Gaza workers, Israeli forces have detained more than 1,450 Palestinian residents of the West Bank since October 7, according to estimates by the Palestinian Prisoners Society.
The arrests have taken place against a backdrop of laws and amendments that human rights organisations say amount to punitive measures.
On October 18, the Israeli parliament, known as the Knesset, approved a temporary plan that strips Palestinian prisoners of the right to at least 4.5 square metres of space, enabling cells that used to hold five people to hold more than twice as many.
According to Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), authorities also disconnected access to power and water supplies, limited the number of meals per day, restricted prisoners to their cells and prevented access to medical clinics and visits by legal representatives and other officials. At least two prisoners have died while in custody since the beginning of the latest round of hostilities.
'We are calling on the Israeli authorities to abide by international law and allow food, water and visitations,' Naji Abbas, case manager at PHRI, told Al Jazeera. 'And to stop taking revenge on Palestinian prisoners.'

Mediator Qatar has announced that a   between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas, based in the Gaza Strip, is set to begin at 7am local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday.
The brief pause in the fighting, which has raged since October 7, has been welcomed after weeks of intense bombardment and   humanitarian conditions in Gaza.
What's in the deal, how will it unfold, and what can we expect to see in the days ahead?
When does the truce begin?
Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry in Qatar, which has played a key role in mediation between the two sides, said that   would take effect at 7am (05:00 GMT) on Friday.
At 4pm (14:00 GMT), a group of 13 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza will be released.
What's included in the deal?
The key components are a pause in the fighting, the exchange of Hamas captives for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, and a halt to air traffic over northern Gaza during certain hours of the day and over southern Gaza entirely.
How will the hostages and prisoners be released?
Over the course of four days, Hamas will release 50 women and children, from about 240 people   by the group during its assault on southern Israel on October 7.
In exchange, Israel will release a total of 150 Palestinian women and children held in  , whom Palestinians have long characterised as victims of an Israeli occupation that sweeps them into prisons with little pretence of due process.
Israel has given a list of about 300 Palestinian prisoners who may be released, none of whom have been accused of murder and many of whom were held under arbitrary detention without trial. Israel has said that its forces will bar celebrations for  .
Israeli Army Radio has said that the first batch of 39 Palestinian prisoners will be released at about 8pm (18:00 GMT) on Friday, and that this will only occur if the hostages held in Gaza are on Israeli soil.
Israel has said that the pause will be extended by one day for every 10 additional hostages released. Qatar has also stated that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will work in Gaza to help facilitate the release process.
In a statement on Thursday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel had received a list of those being released and has notified their  .
The development has brought  .
(Al Jazeera)
What about armed activity?
Asked about the status of armed activity under the deal, chief Qatari negotiator Mohammed Al-Khulaifi said 'no attack whatsoever' would take place.
'No military movements, no expansion, nothing," he said.
Hamas has said that Israel agreed to suspend air traffic over northern Gaza from 10am (08:00 GMT) until 4pm (14:00 GMT) each day, and over southern Gaza for the entirety of the truce.
The group said that Israel agreed not to attack or arrest anyone in Gaza, and that people can move freely along Salah al-Din Road, the main street along which many Palestinians have fled northern Gaza, where Israel launched its ground invasion.
Hamas also said that its   and all other 'Palestinian factions' will halt 'all military activity' when the truce enters into effect.
The group said that 200 aid trucks and four fuel trucks will be allowed into Gaza each day, as Palestinian civilians reel from a humanitarian crisis caused by weeks of Israeli bombardment and harsh restrictions on  , fuel, electricity and water.
Is this the end of the fighting?
Probably not. While countries such as  , humanitarian groups, and world leaders have expressed hope that the truce could pave the way for a long-term ceasefire, both Israel and Hamas have expressed their intent to fight on.
On Thursday, a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, Abu Obeida, said that Palestinian fighters remain ready to confront Israeli forces so long as the war continues and called for resistance to Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant called the upcoming pause a "brief respite … at the end of which the fighting will continue intensely, and we will create pressure to bring back more hostages" during an interview with a navy special operations unit on Thursday.
"At least another two months of fighting is expected," he said.
 
This week, Netanyahu said the deal constituted a pause rather than an end to the war.
'We are at war, and we will continue the war,' he said. 'We will continue until we achieve all our goals.'

Anxious, optimistic: Families of female Palestinian prisoners await release

At her home in the occupied East Jerusalem town of Sur Baher, Sameera Dwayyat is gripped with anxiety and apprehension.
The name of her daughter, Shorouq, who is currently serving the longest sentence of all the female Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, is on the list of prisoners due for release over the next few days in exchange for 50 Israeli captives held in Gaza by Hamas.
"I'm so nervous," Sameera, also known as Imm Ibrahim, told Al Jazeera. "We haven't heard confirmation about the names [to be released] from any official side, and neither the Red Cross nor the Palestinian Prisoners Club have contacted us."
After six weeks of fighting, Israel and Hamas have   that will begin on Thursday.
As part of the truce, Israel has agreed to release 150 Palestinian women and children from its prisons, in exchange for Hamas releasing 50 Israeli women and children out of the 237   abducted since October 7.
Hundreds of trucks carrying vital humanitarian aid and fuel will also be allowed into Gaza.
Shorouq Dwayyat, who is currently serving her ninth year of a 16-year sentence, is one of many prisoners who campaigners say have been unjustly tried and sentenced on unfair or fabricated charges. She was also fined 80,000 shekels ($21,500).
She was just 18 years old when Israeli forces arrested her as she was walking home on October 7, 2015 after they shot her four times, leaving her in critical condition.

She was accused of attempting to stab an Israeli settler with a knife, but her family strongly refutes the charges.
'It is impossible for me to believe the Israeli story that my daughter stabbed a settler," Salah Dwayyat, her father, told Al Jazeera  at the time. "Shorouq is delicate and cannot harm an animal."
Palestinian witnesses said an Israeli settler had tried to pull off her hijab while she was walking past, in a deliberate act of provocation. She pushed back and Israeli forces fired four bullets into her body, leaving her to bleed on the ground for half an hour before arresting her.
Shorouq was treated at the Ein Karem/Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, undergoing skin grafts and several operations. She had just started her first semester at Bethlehem University as a geography and history student, after obtaining a 90 percent average in her high school results.
"She would be the one to lift my spirits up whenever I would visit her in Damon prison in Haifa," her mother said. "I had no hope that she would be released early, to the point where she had stopped asking me if I thought there was a chance of that."
The fifth child of seven, Shorouq would ask about her siblings, two of whom have married during the years she has spent in prison, and the nieces and nephews that she could not meet.
"This year – call it a mother's intuition – I had a feeling she would be free," Sameera said. "I told her during my last visit that I can see her at the front door of our home."
"I hope it will be true," she added, her voice catching. "I hope she can come home."
'They wanted revenge on my family'
In the northern occupied West Bank town of Sila al-Harthiya, Muntaser Jaradat said he cannot wait for his mother, Awatif, to be released from Damon prison in northern Palestine.
The 33-year-old was himself released from the notorious Naqab prison on November 1, but two other brothers remain in other prisons.
Awatif Jaradat, 50, was arrested in December 2021 after Israeli forces arrested her youngest son, Ghaith, who was 18 at the time. Another son, Omar, 21 was also arrested – as was Muntaser himself two months later.
Israeli forces had accused Ghaith of carrying out an attack that resulted in the death of an Israeli settler and the injury of two others. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years.
"Israel accused my mother of incitement after she spoke to media saying that she was proud of her sons for resisting the occupation," Muntaser said. "They wanted a lengthy sentence for her, nine to 15 years in prison."
"They just wanted revenge on our family," he said.

The mother of nine is known for her strong personality, especially in the face of adversity, her son said. Muntaser said that she acted as a medical chaperone for a fellow prisoner, Fatima Shaheen, who was arrested last April after Israeli forces shot her, resulting in wounds that left her paralysed. Shaheen is also on the list of female prisoners due to be released.
Awatif was allowed to accompany Shaheen to Ramleh prison for medical treatment, but was not allowed to stay with her. Instead, she was placed three months in solitary confinement at Ramleh, with no communication with the outside world, before being returned to Damon.
"The past two years have been hard for my family, who had to travel to four different prisons to see me in Naqab, Ghaith in Nafha, Omar in Gilboa and my mother in Damon," Muntaser said. "We have had no word about Omar for two months."
He described how Palestinian prisoners had been subject to torture following the Hamas attack on Israeli army outposts and towns outside the Gaza Strip on October 7.
"They would beat us so severely, that the ground would be stained with streaks of blood," he said. "It was like being in Guantanamo Bay or Abu Ghraib prison. They humiliated us and would stomp on us with their boots. They also cut off water and electricity and threw away our belongings."
In Bethlehem, Amna Salameh is optimistic about having her youngest daughter Maysoon Mousa back home after almost nine years in prison. Maysoon was arrested in 2015 when she was 22 years old and sentenced to 15 years in prison after being accused of stabbing a soldier.
"We're happy to hear the news," she said. "I last saw Maysoon two months ago, but since October 7, we haven't been allowed visits and we heard that the prisoners are being mistreated badly. We hope all the prisoners will be released and the suffering of our people in Gaza will stop."

Prehistoric Palestinian site added to UNESCO world heritage list

A UN committee has voted to list prehistoric ruins near the ancient city of Jericho in the occupied West Bank as a World Heritage Site in Palestine.
The decision, which has been criticised by Israel, was made at a meeting of the UN World Heritage Committee in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Sunday under the auspices of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO.
The listing refers to the Tell al-Sultan archaeological site nearby, which contains prehistoric ruins dating back to the ninth millennium BC and is outside the ancient city itself.
"A permanent settlement had emerged here by the 9th to 8th millennium BC due to the fertile soil of the oasis and easy access to water," UNESCO said on its website.

Tell al-Sultan, an oval-shaped mound, contains evidence of one of humanity's first-known villages and an important Bronze-Age town dating back to 2600 BC.
It is around 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) from the remains of the first city of Jericho, which contains ruins of importance to Jewish history, including a synagogue dating back to the first century B.C.
Jericho is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities on earth, and is in a part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank that is administered by the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority.
Israel criticises decision
Israel's foreign ministry released a statement Sunday denouncing the decision, calling it a "cynical ploy".
"The foreign ministry considers today's decision another sign of the cynical use the Palestinians are making of UNESCO and the organisation's politicisation," the statement said.
"Israel will act with its many friends in the organisation to change the flawed decisions made."
Israel quit the UN organisation in 2019 over accusations that it fosters an anti-Israel bias, but did send a delegation to this year's meeting in Saudi Arabia.

There have been no serious or substantive   in over a decade, and Israel is currently led by the one of the most far-right, nationalist governments in its history, making any move toward Palestinian statehood appear extremely unlikely.
Historical heritage has long been among the many flashpoints in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with both sides using archaeology and conservation to demonstrate what they say is their own unique connection to the Holy Land.
The Palestinian Authority, recognised a decade ago by the United Nations as a nonmember observer state, welcomed the designation of Tell al-Sultan.
President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement that it "testifies to the authenticity and history of the Palestinian people," adding that "the state of Palestine is committed to preserving this unique site for the benefit of mankind."

Ex-US diplomat demands more dead Palestinian children in Islamophobic rant

A former senior US official is facing a backlash after harassing a halal food vendor in New York.
Stuart Seldowitz, who previously served as deputy director of the United States Department of State's Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs, was captured on video taunting and threatening the vendor in Manhattan. Amid the apparent argument over the ongoing Gaza war, he told his adversary that more Palestinian children should die.
This man wearing a green jacket was berating and harassing a halal cart vendor off 83rd and 2nd Ave in NYC. Does anyone know who this man is? Planning to report to the authorities. pic.twitter.com/GwklyXpsPH
- Layla (@itslaylas) November 21, 2023
'If we killed 4,000 Palestinian kids, it wasn't enough,' Seldowitz says calmly in one exchange captured on video and posted on the social media platform X.
In another, he tells the food vendor: 'Mohammed, your prophet … was a rapist.'
He also threatens to use his government connections to mobilise Egypt's secret police against the vendor, who he accuses of being a "terrorist".
'The Mukhabarat in Egypt will get your parents. Does your father like his fingernails? They'll take them out one by one,' Seldowitz says smiling.
The vendor is heard repeatedly asking him to leave and telling him he does not speak English.
Seldowitz says the vendor's lack of English fluency shows he is "ignorant".
"You should learn English, it'll help you when they deport you back to Egypt and the Mukhabarat wants to interview you," he tells the vendor with a grin.
US government experience
Seldowitz reportedly had a distinguished career with the State Department from 1999 to 2003. He also served on the National Security Council's South Asia Directorate under then-President Barack Obama and went on to become foreign affairs chair at New York lobbying firm Gotham Government Relations, according to a 2022 press release  from the company.
The former diplomat admitted in an interview with The New York Times that he had gotten angry with the Manhattan vendor and said things he 'probably [regrets]'.
He claimed the vendor enraged him after expressing sympathies for the Palestinian group Hamas, although none of the videos shows the vendor mentioning the group.
'I got rather upset and I've said things to him, that in retrospect, I probably regret," Seldowitz told the newspaper. 'Instead of focusing in on him and what he said, I expanded into insulting his religion and so on.'
Seldowitz insisted that he is not Islamophobic, saying that he has many Muslim and Arab colleagues who could vouch for him.
Gotham Government Relations on Tuesday said it had severed all ties with Seldowitz and apparently scrubbed his profile from their website.
The firm's CEO, David Schwartz, said he was 'personally outraged and offended by' Seldowitz's 'vile' language and offered to legally represent the food vendor pro bono.
The incident underscores growing tensions globally and in the US over the 47-day war in Gaza, which has killed at least 14,100 Palestinians, more than a third of them children.
Since October 7, frequent pro-Israel and pro-Palestine   have taken place in New York, which has large Muslim and Jewish populations.

Belize joins diplomatic backlash against Israel over Gaza bombardment

Belize has suspended ties with Israel due to its 'indiscriminate bombing' of the Gaza Strip, the latest in a string of diplomatic rebukes of Tel Aviv.
The Belize government announced on Tuesday that it was recalling its ambassador and retracting its request for accreditation for its honorary consul in Tel Aviv.
Belmopan issued a statement denouncing the Israeli military's 'unceasing' attacks on the besieged Palestinian enclave and blocking of aid.
'The government of Belize has repeatedly condemned the actions of the [Israeli military] in Gaza', said the government statement . 'We have appealed to Israel to implement an immediate ceasefire and to allow unimpeded access to humanitarian supplies into Gaza.
"Despite our requests, Israel has not stopped its violations of international humanitarian law nor allowed relief workers to alleviate the suffering of millions," the statement continued.
Belize's decision follows similar moves by several other Latin American states. Bolivia broke relations with Israel on November 1, while Colombia, Chile and Honduras have recalled their ambassadors.
Rifts have also deepened between Tel Aviv and several Middle Eastern and African states. Turkey, Bahrain, Jordan, Chad, and South Africa have all withdrawn their top diplomats since the war broke out.
A surprise assault by Palestinian group Hamas on October 7 killed some 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and seized 240 hostages, Israel says.
Israel has since waged a devastating bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, killing at least 11,320 people, including thousands of children, according to Gaza officials.
The 40-day   has displaced some 1.5 million Palestinians, wrecked much of the territory's infrastructure and sparked a desperate humanitarian crisis, aid workers say.

October 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Occupied East Jerusalem – Adnan Barq, a quick-witted 23-year-old, skirts around the ancient walls of Jerusalem's Old City, looking for a way back home.
He eyes one of the seven guarded gates that line the UNESCO World Heritage Site through a slick pair of dark-rimmed glasses; groups of Israeli soldiers are pacing in front of the arched entrance, picking out people to stop and frisk.
He doesn't like what he sees. Flicking his head, he walks past the gate and up a main street lined with fruit stalls and busy vendors offering street food.
"It's about reading the room," he quips.
Barq, like many other Palestinians from the Old City, has grown used to being harassed when heading back home to the Old City by Israeli soldiers and police over the years.
That was until last week when the Palestinian group Hamas broke out of the besieged Gaza Strip and attacked communities in the south of Israel.
Since then, Barq says, the Palestinians of the Old City have faced unprecedented levels of harassment.
According to Palestinians from the Old City whom Al Jazeera spoke to, they now face new interrogation tactics at its entry points, including phone searches, increased use of physical force and vulgar insults.

WhatsApp and Telegram groups, populated by young Palestinian men, are rife with countless surreptitious recordings of such events, with subscribers offering advice on avoiding having personal devices accessed.
A short walk along the walls shows how Palestinian men are regularly singled out and pushed up against the Old City's distinct limestone walls, their legs pushed apart as they are frisked.
Hamza Afghani, a 27-year-old Palestinian tour guide from the Old City, says he was recently subjected to physical harassment, followed by a tirade of insults directed at female family members.
With the current climate in the country among the security forces, he says there is zero tolerance for any pushback, leaving him feeling helpless.
"Before, you could talk back. But now they would frame you as an attacker, without any accountability because there is a state of emergency," he says.
The insults, mainly directed at young men, are also intended to provoke a reaction.
"The Israeli soldiers know for us as Palestinians – of whom the majority are Muslims – cursing women is a red line, so they provoke our feelings to push back," he explains.
Sari, a 24-year-old chef who works at a trendy burger restaurant in occupied East Jerusalem, now fears returning to his home in the Old City every night.

The regular searches used to be bearable, but over the last week, he says, the actions of the police and soldiers have left his family members deeply traumatised.
A night-time raid on his family home left his father terrified and holed up in their home, begging Sari not to go to work.
"The soldiers, they say what they want now; they shout, threaten your family, they do what they want," he says, leaning out of the restaurant door to light up a cigarette.
He pauses, taking a long drag from his cigarette. "If you say anything, you go straight to the police station."
The exhaustion is visible on Sari's face; a commute that should have taken a matter of minutes now fills his work day with anxiety. "Now I'm scared to go there," he says, motioning towards the street. "I'm just afraid to go outside."
A policy of collective punishment
Barq says the Palestinians in Jerusalem have long borne the brunt of "a policy of collective punishment" from the Israeli authorities when there is a flare-up in tension due to its symbolic significance.
Israel occupied East Jerusalem at the end of the 1967 war against Syria, Egypt, and Jordan – having captured the western half in the 1948 war.
In 1980, Israel passed the 'Jerusalem Law', which claimed that the entire holy city is the "capital of Israel', which meant East Jerusalem was formally annexed, a move rejected by the international community.
"The sense of oppression felt amongst the Palestinians living in Jerusalem is absolutely exhausting," says Barq.
Living in the tiny, ancient OId City as a Palestinian comes with additional pressure that he feels is now reaching a fever pitch.
"We have always been stressed physically and virtually, but now soldiers are actively pursuing us."
