What has Israel 'found' in Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital?

Israel on Thursday raided Gaza's al-Shifa hospital for a second day in a row.
On Wednesday, Israeli troops had   the coastal enclave's largest medical facility, starting at 2am. Israel has long claimed that Hamas was using the hospital as a command centre. The Israeli army has said the raid has helped it find evidence to back up its assertion.
So what does Israel claim to have found?
What was found in the hospital?
The Israeli military released video footage from inside an undisclosed building within the medical complex.
The video showed three duffel bags that the military claims were found hidden in an MRI lab, each containing an assault rifle, grenades, Hamas uniforms and flak jackets.
Additionally, the army showed assault rifles without ammunition clips and a laptop that it said were found.
Israeli military spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said: 'These weapons have absolutely no business being inside a hospital,' adding that he believed the material was 'just the top of the iceberg.'
What about Hamas tunnels and military command?
In the days leading up to the raid, Israel insisted that   underground al-Shifa Hospital. It also claimed that the hospital was a command centre and military post for Hamas.
Israel's claims were also backed by United States President Joe Biden, who accused Hamas of committing war crimes by having its military headquarters under the hospital.
Yet, more than 24 hours after Israel's raid started, the Israeli army has not shown evidence of either Hamas-run   or a military command centre under the hospital.
An Al Jazeera digital investigation found no grounds to the Israeli forces claim that there is a Hamas tunnel under Gaza's Sheikh Hamad Hospital ️ pic.twitter.com/4640OprGwk
- Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) November 7, 2023
Are there holes in Israel's claims?
Mustafa Barghouti, the general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, said that what Israel had shown in videos from under al-Shifa Hospital so far could easily have been planted by the army itself.
'All they've shown is a Kalashnikov and a laptop that they could have put there easily and claim that it was found there,' the veteran Palestinian legislator told Al Jazeera.
 
On X, formerly Twitter, the Israeli army first posted a video of Conricus taking viewers on a tour through parts of al-Shifa, which it said was without any edits or cuts.
But it deleted that post and then republished a near-identical video, with some tweaks. On social platforms, that further fuelled questions about the veracity of Israel's claims.
How has Hamas responded?
Hamas has denied and dismissed the latest statements by the Israeli military.
"The occupation forces are still lying … as they brought some weapons, clothes and tools and placed them in the hospital in a scandalous manner," Qatar-based Hamas senior member Ezzat El Rashq said.
He added that Hamas has repeatedly called for a committee from the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the International Committee of the Red Cross to verify Israel's claims of Hamas tunnels under Gaza hospitals.
Barghouti said Israel has constantly rejected these calls for an independent, international team to investigate the situation in al-Shifa. 'Israel doesn't want that because they know that they are lying,' he said.
What is happening in al-Shifa now?
Israel's military continues to attack al-Shifa, with troops deployed on all sides of the hospital, Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud reported from Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
The Israeli military has destroyed the specialised surgeries building in the medical facility. The partitions, walls between the rooms and all the medical equipment inside the building have been completely demolished, he said.
Hundreds of patients, doctors and nurses, and more than 2,000 others sheltering at al-Shifa are still believed to be at the hospital.
'What we see today is that this war is about attacking civilians and attacking hospitals and destroying medical facilities,' said Barghouti.

Who is Jacob Lew, Biden's nominee for US ambassador to Israel?

September 5th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC – US President Joe Biden has nominated former Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew to be the country's next ambassador to Israel, as the United States pushes   with its top Middle East ally.
The White House announced Lew's nomination on Tuesday, months after   – the former envoy to Israel – resigned from his post.
Lew still needs to be confirmed in the Democratic-controlled Senate, where Republican lawmakers have been using procedural hurdles to delay and block the Biden administration's diplomatic nominees.
"Today, President Joe Biden announced his intent to nominate Jacob J Lew to serve as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the State of Israel," the White House said in a statement.
Lew, who held senior government positions in the administrations of Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and  , has been an outspoken supporter of Israel.
He currently serves as co-president of the board of the National Library of Israel, USA, a New York-based group that supports the library in Israel and its programmes.
In a social media post on Tuesday morning,Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen welcomed Lew's appointment as ambassador to a "country you know so well".
"We look forward to working with you in the spirit of our close cooperation and alliance," Cohen said.
Lew's nomination comes at a time when the US is working to secure formal diplomatic relations between  .
The Biden administration is also pushing to include Israel in its  , which would allow Israelis to travel visa-free to the US despite concerns about Israel's mistreatment of Palestinian Americans.
But the US-Israel relationship has seen some recent friction, with Biden warning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against going through with a   that critics say would weaken the courts and rule of law in Israel.
The US State Department also has regularly voiced criticism of Netanyahu's policies against Palestinians, including   in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Still, Biden administration officials often stress that the US commitment to Israel is "ironclad".
Roles in US government
Lew previously made headlines on Israel-related issues.
In 2015, he was booed by pro-Israel supporters during a Jerusalem Post conference in New York for defending the Iran nuclear deal, which saw Tehran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for a lifting of sanctions against its economy.
Israel and its backers opposed the multilateral agreement, which was signed by the Obama administration and major world powers.
But Lew has insisted that   – which was nixed by former President Donald Trump in 2018 – was good for Israel and that US-Israel cooperation was at its "highest level" under Obama.
Lew was Obama's White House chief of staff before being appointed treasury secretary in 2013. He also served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under both Clinton and Obama.
The ambassador-designate first joined the Obama administration as deputy secretary of state for management and resources.
Outside of government work, he has held many positions at academic and financial institutions.
In remarks at Columbia University in 2017, Lew lauded the Obama administration's efforts to push back against the  , a United Nations fact-finding mission that accused Israel of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in its 2009 war in Gaza.
"The United States was really the only country that was out there under President Obama defending Israel against things like the Goldstone Report," Lew said at that time, as reported by Jewish Insider.
"I can't tell you how many dozens of phone calls were made, presidential, vice presidential, secretarial, sub-cabinet level, to try and prevent Israel from being isolated."
At the same event, Lew also addressed the Obama administration's decision not to veto a 2016 UN Security Council resolution that called   a "flagrant violation under international law", sayingWashington worked to water down the measure.
"Personally, I wish the resolution hadn't been there at all. I'm not happy that there was a resolution," he said.
"I'm also happy it wasn't in its original form where we would have had to veto it, but then the rest of the world would have been voting for this even harsher condemnation."

'A lot of discontent': Netanyahu alone as Israel turns on wartime PM

November 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Beirut, Lebanon — As the families of Israeli captives held in Gaza march from Tel Aviv to   in Jerusalem on Saturday, Israel's longest-serving premier has never been less popular.
A poll from November 14  has Netanyahu's popularity among Israeli Jews at about 4 percent and both his opponents and traditional allies are calling for him to resign once the current war ends.
'He's very vulnerable, more than he's ever been in his political career given that he presided over the greatest intelligence security failure in Israel's history,' Khaled Elgindy, an expert on Palestinian-Israeli Affairs at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. 'Prime ministers have fallen for far less than that.'
Ever since he won elections last November and installed the most right-wing government in the country's history, Netanyahu has battled criticism. Protests have plagued Netanyahu's latest term over his attempts at judicial reforms. But October 7 has eroded much of even what remained of the support Netanyahu once enjoyed, say experts.
'I suspect there's a   with his leadership of the government, even within his own party,' Zachary Lockman, an expert on Palestine and Israel at New York University, told Al Jazeera.
Hostage failures
In Israel, 94 percent of the population  believes Netanyahu's government is at least partially to blame for the events of October 7, when Hamas fighters broke through border fences and attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people.
A majority of Israelis believed in the days after the attack that Netanyahu should resign after the war ends – and that frustration has only grown since then. Much of the criticism directed at Netanyahu has been on his seeming lack of interest in freeing the more than 200 captives held in Gaza by Hamas and other armed groups.
On Friday, Israel found the bodies of at least two of the captives. Four captives have been released through mediation efforts led by Qatar and other nations.
But Netanyahu has so far refused a larger deal for a temporary ceasefire in exchange for the release of more captives. He said he would only consider stopping the assault on Gaza when all hostages are freed.   suggest that Palestinian groups offered to release at least 50 of the hostages in exchange for a three-day ceasefire but Netanyahu allegedly rebuffed the deal.
So far, US President Joe Biden has supported Netanyahu in opposing a ceasefire, despite growing   and disapproval  in the Democratic Party in the United States.
'They've had the full support of the United States, but the patience of the Biden administration may run out at some point,' Lockman said. 'Demands for a ceasefire are increasing in the United States but [also] in Europe and other places.'
Inner party turmoil
Netanyahu may maintain Biden's support, but his own base is fraying.
After the conflict ends 'there will be a large group of people in Likud that will change the existing situation,' Yehiel Zohar, the Likud-affiliated mayor of Netivot, a town about 8.5km (5.3 miles) from Gaza, told  the Times of Israel.
The frustration at Netanyahu is boiling over to the point some are even quitting the Likud party altogether. Tamir Idan, the head of the Sdot Negev Regional Council, tore up his Likud membership card on live television. He said he was frustrated at the lack of support from Netanyahu's government.
'[National Security Minister Itamar]   won't answer us. [Finance Minister Bezalel]   sends his assistants,' Idan told the Times of Israel. 'Others don't come at all. This government does not function.'
In the media, Israel Hayom, a right-wing newspaper that often backs Netanyahu, called for him to, 'Take responsibility and accept that the buck stops with you.'
The only thread holding Netanyahu's government together seems to be coming from the far right, which, until now, has continued to back Netanyahu, while taking advantage of the focus on Gaza to continue its aggressions in the West Bank.
'The status quo is very good for Ben Gvir and Smotrich,' Elgindy said. 'Netanyahu is battling for his life and everyone is focused on Gaza so they can do whatever they want in the West Bank. The settlers are rampaging, the army is on a rampage and very few people are paying attention so they get to implement their radical agenda.'
But cracks are emerging even there. After the Netanyahu war cabinet agreed on Friday to allow two trucks of fuel into Gaza every day — which activists, nonprofits and others have described as little more than a token gesture for a population of 2.3 million people — Smotrich and Ben-Gvir both criticised the move.
Opponents ready to pounce
Netanyahu has also accrued plenty of enemies over the years. These figures are lining up to take shots at Netanyahu, but few have volunteered to take over for him in the interim. As Netanyahu's popularity has fallen, one rival, the former Defence Minister  , has seen his rise.
Gantz is also a member of Netanyahu's war cabinet and criticised the prime minister after October 7, when he blamed Israel's intelligence services and military for the Hamas attack.
'He's been dreaming of [becoming prime minister] for a long time and framing himself as the natural leader at the centre of the Israeli political spectrum who could unite the left and right and centre,' Lockman said. Gantz is also 'free of some of the many burdens that Netanyahu carries,' such as the corruption cases that the prime minister faces.
The November 14 poll asked participants, "Who is more suitable for the position of premier, Netanyahu or Gantz?" Israel's current prime minister lost out to Gantz by 22 percentage points. But whether Gantz can displace Netanyahu remains to be seen — where he agreed to join Netanyahu's team after October, many others among the prime minister's critics refused.
One of those opponents was Yair Lapid, the center-left opposition leader. He said on Wednesday that 'another Likud prime minister" should  . Lapid agrees with Netanyahu that Hamas needs to be eradicated, though both Israeli and Palestinian figures have pointed out the notion's futility.
'It is interesting that people are starting to demand for him to step down now as opposed to after the war,' Elgindy said. 'Maybe that's a realisation that the war isn't going to end any time soon. Israel has very open-ended, unclear objectives and they are probably unachievable, at least in the way they've articulated them.'
The war effort is costing the Israeli economy about $260m daily, according  to Bloomberg, and 300 prominent Israeli and foreign economists urged Netanyahu's government to 'immediately come to your senses'. Public support is mounting against him and the international support he carried early after October 7 continues to erode as the death toll in Gaza mounts.
'The war is not going to end with the great victory that Israelis have been led to believe,' Lockman said. 'And when that letdown sets in, you know, somebody will have to pay the price for this politically.'
But Israel's longest-serving prime minister has managed political comebacks before, including last year when he already had corruption charges hanging over his head.
'My sense is this is probably fatal for him politically. I don't see how he survives this politically,' Elgindy said. 'People are angry about October 7th and the hostages and he was already unpopular before October 7th.'
Elgindy paused for a second, before adding, 'But if anyone could engineer a path it would be him.'

Israeli military attacks Gaza Strip amid protests at border

The Israeli military has said its forces have conducted air attacks on the blockaded Gaza Strip, where protesters have had confrontations for days with Israeli troops along the separation fence.
The military gave no details on the attacks on Friday, but media outlets affiliated with the Hamas movement governing the Gaza Strip said security outposts were hit.
Al Jazeera's correspondent Youmna El Sayed said at least 22 people had been injured, according to the Ministry of Health.
In al-Maghazi refugee camp, El Sayed said drones had appeared overhead in a matter of minutes, dropping stun grenades and tear gas canisters on the heavily populated area.
Meanwhile, tanks positioned on the border shot artillery shells at the Palestinian enclave, the correspondent said.
'It seems that Israel is responding to the incendiary balloons sent by the protesters across the border,' she said.
The protesters were evacuating the area as a result of the attacks, the reporter added.
Israel shut the Beit Hanouna (called "Erez" by Israel) crossing with Gaza last week in advance of the Rosh Hashanah Jewish holiday, preventing thousands of workers from getting to their jobs in Israel and the West Bank. The closure was extended after days of border demonstrations in which Israeli troops opened fire on stone-throwing protesters.
Approximately 18,000 Gaza Palestinians have permits from Israeli authorities to work outside the blockaded enclave, providing a vital injection of cash amounting to some $2m a day to the impoverished territory's economy.
Demonstrators along the Gaza separation fence have hurled stones as well as improvised explosive devices, while Israeli troops have attacked with tear gas and live fire.

About 2,835 units have been damaged, about 1,791 have become uninhabitable due to severe damage, and 12,630 have sustained lesser damage, according to United Nations briefings on October 11  and October 12 .
19 medical centres: A World Health Organization Report on Thursday said that 19 health facilities had been damaged. On Wednesday, the UN OCHA reported that all 13 hospitals and other medical centres were only partially operational due to shortages of supplies and fuel. Al Jazeera correspondent Youmna ElSayed also reported on Wednesday that Beit Hanoon hospital and al-Oyun hospital in Tel al-Hawa were completely out of service due to the bombardment.
20 ambulances: A World Health Organization Report on Thursday reported 20 ambulances have been damaged.
90 education facilities: At least 90 educational facilities have been damaged, according to OCHA. Twenty of these were UNRWA installations, two of which were also used as emergency shelters.
70 industrial facilities: ReliefWeb reported that at least 70 industrial facilities had been destroyed. Most sewage pumping stations and four out of five wastewater treatment plants have stopped operating, causing sewage and solid waste to accumulate in the streets and become a health hazard, according to OCHA.
49 media offices: According to Euro-Med, 49 media and press offices have been destroyed. This includes a local independent newspaper Al-Ayyam, based in Palestine Tower in Gaza, which was completely destroyed in an Israeli attack, according to Reporters Without Borders.

What military aid the US is sending to Israel after Hamas attack?

Hours after the deadly Hamas  attack inside Israel, US President Joe Biden promised 'rock-solid and unwavering' support to its closest ally in the Middle East.
Washington, which provides about $3bn in annual military aid to Israel, has ordered the movement of military ships and aircraft closer to Israel as a show of support following    by the Palestinian armed group
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Hamas attack a 'massive terrorist attack' in an interview with ABC News on Sunday. 'We have immediately engaged our Israeli partners and allies. President [Joe] Biden was on the phone with Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu early yesterday to assure him of our full support,' he added.
Here's the US military support for Israel:
Navy ships
The USS Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group will be moved to the Eastern Mediterranean alongside its accompanying warships.
The USS Ford is the US Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, alongside being one of the largest in the world. The carrier hosts a guided missile cruiser and four guided missile destroyers
The US is additionally sending USS Normandy, a guided missile cruiser armed with naval guns, and destroyers USS Thomas Hudner, USS Ramage, USS Carney and USS Roosevelt.
Austin said that the US is augmenting Air Force F-35, the most advanced fighter jet in the world, along with the F-15, F-16, and A-10 fighter aircraft squadrons in the region.
'I do not understand in strategic military terms why the US would send aircraft carriers - with some 5,000 sailors on it - and the most sophisticated aircraft in the world when Israel is more than capable of dealing with Hamas in the Gaza Strip,' said Al Jazeera's senior political analyst, Marwan Bishara. Bishara called the US decision to move the Ford Carrier a major escalation.
Munitions
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday the US would provide munitions to Israel.
'We don't know exactly what kind of munitions, but it is suspected that Israel has requested both interceptors and precision-guided munitions,' said Al Jazeera's John Hendren, reporting from Washington, DC. Hendren said that the interceptors are for Israel's Iron Dome defence system. Those are the devices that strike the Hamas rockets and in some cases cause them to harmlessly explode in the air rather than land.
The Al Jazeera correspondent said that $2bn worth of US munitions have been pre-supplied in six different locations in Israel that can be used in case of emergencies.
How much military aid does the US give Israel?
Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC,   that the US contributes $3bn a year in military aid to Israel.
Israel is the   of United States foreign assistance since World War II.
How has Hamas responded to US aid to Israel?
Hamas has labelled the US announcement as 'aggression' against Palestinians.
'The announcement of the US that it will provide an aircraft carrier to support the occupation [Israel] is actual participation in the aggression against our people,' the group said in a statement on Sunday.

Israel clamps down on Al Mayadeen, steps back on threats to Al Jazeera

Israel will block media outlet Al Mayadeen but has indicated that it will refrain from shuttering Al Jazeera's local bureau.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet said in a statement released on Monday that it had approved the decision to block the programming and websites of Lebanon-based, pro-Iranian channel Al Mayadeen. However, it made no mention of Al Jazeera, despite earlier threats to use emergency regulations to clamp down on its Palestinian offices.
The cabinet statement said it would shutter Al Mayadeen due to its 'wartime efforts to harm [Israel's] security interests and to serve the enemy's goals'.
Asked why Al Jazeera was not included in the Israeli security cabinet decision, the Ministry of Communicationsspokesperson said: "The security cabinet has not discussed that."
Israel's government passed wartime regulations allowing it to provisionally close foreign media it deemed a threat to its national interests in mid-October.
Israel's Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi at the time said  he hoped the measures would be used against Qatar-owned Al Jazeera, which is one of the few international media channels to broadcast live from Gaza during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
The minister accused Al Jazeera of pro-Hamas bias and incitement against Israel.
Press freedom organisations denounced the calls to shutter Al Jazeera and other media.
"We are deeply concerned by Israeli officials' threats to censor media coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict, using vague accusations of harming national morale," said Sherif Mansour of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
"CPJ urges Israel not to ban Al Jazeera and to allow journalists to do their jobs," Mansour said.
Balancing act
Israel's security cabinet's decision to withhold action on Al Jazeera reflects its complex balancing act with Doha, which it is counting on to help negotiate with Hamas to free some 220 hostages still in captivity in Gaza.
Israeli media have quoted unnamed Netanyahu government officials as saying the time was not right to restrict Al Jazeera.
However, other top officials, such as Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, have continued to publicly back a crackdown on the channel.
Israel has often lashed out at Al Jazeera, which has offices in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
In May 2022, Israeli forces   senior Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh while she was covering an Israeli military raid in the West Bank town of Jenin.
A United Nations-commissioned report concluded that Israeli forces used 'lethal force without justification' in the killing, violating her 'right to life'.
Amid the war in Gaza, several of the channel's journalists and their family members have died under Israel's bombardment.
On October 25, an  killed the family of Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh, including his wife, son, daughter, grandson, and at least eight other relatives.
Restrictions on Al Mayadeen
Following the Israeli security cabinet's decision, Karhi was working with police on a proposed blocking of Al Mayadeen websites and seizure of equipment linked to the station, a ministry spokesperson said.
The minister also asked Israel's military chief in the occupied West Bank to shut down Al Mayadeen offices there, the spokesperson said.
Al Mayadeen issued no immediate comment.
Though Israel and Lebanon are formally in a decades-old state of war and the Lebanese Shia Muslim group Hezbollah has joined the current hostilities on the side of Gaza's Palestinians, Al Mayadeen has been airing reports from inside Israeli territory.

Analysis: Why did it take Israel three days to return to Gaza's boundary?

October 11th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel has announced that on Tuesday its forces   the territory up to the boundary of the Gaza Strip.
  on the ground did not offer any significant opposition to the deployment of the Israeli army, but they almost certainly never intended to resist the return of Israeli soldiers.
Indeed, the primary military purpose of Hamas's operation on Saturday seems to have been to demonstrate, to Israelis, Arabs and  , its capability to attack multiple locations across the frontier of Gaza and take over significant territory in a series of coordinated lightning strikes.
Hamas achieved this goal swiftly and efficiently by the   of surprise and tactical innovation and in doing so achieved a secondary military goal of testing the Israeli army's tactics and equipment, also with unprecedented success.
A step too far?
Gory scenes from a number of military and civilian locations that Hamas took by surprise within hours of the start of the dawn operation are a strong indication that the operation did not have purely military goals.
Taking enemy combatants and using prisoners of war as bargaining chips for future negotiations is a military practice as old as human conflict itself. But the Hamas fighters embarked on a rampage unprecedented even in previous Israeli-Palestinian confrontations, spreading fear through what was widely reported as the indiscriminate murder of hundreds of civilians and captives.
Finally, they took back into the Gaza Strip a yet unknown number of  , believed to be over 100, including foreign nationals.
Caught unawares, the Israeli military responded quickly, predictably, and in the easiest way, by   targets inside Gaza. What they hit and on what logic is a subject for future in-depth analysis, but it is safe to assume that the real aim of the bombing was to demonstrate force, show the shocked Israelis that their army was not knocked out, that it was hitting back.
The unprecedented degree of strategic surprise and deception achieved by the Palestinian side indicates careful planning, so it is unlikely that Hamas was caught unprepared by the expected  . Most military hardware was probably moved and hidden well before the knee-jerk Israeli air attacks.
The profound humiliation that Israeli intelligence and military suffered on Saturday resonated deeply and painfully within the country's defence establishment. Operational earthquakes of such magnitude, rare in modern combat, send shockwaves wide and deep.
A slower-than-expected pace
A side that gets punched so hard must activate its worst-case scenarios. Following such a drastic failure to predict an attack and prepare for it, the Israeli military and secret services must have had to account for the possibility of having suffered a deep security breach and assume that their operational plans had been compromised.
Headquarters of every force in the world prepare in peacetime by conducting war games, brainstorming sessions, simulations and exercises to predict all possible variants of their enemies' actions and find the best and most efficient ways of countering them.
It is unlikely that Tzahal, as the Israeli army is known, had contemplated this kind of attack. There was certainly a general plan of what to do should Palestinian fighters break out from Gaza into Israel but they probably never anticipated this level of complexity, improvisation and innovation.
Under normal circumstances, generals immediately choose the most appropriate plan and activate it; units are given their initial orders and can move quickly, adapting   to the situation on the ground.
Not this time. With the possibility that Hamas somehow spied on Israel and obtained the battle plans, they had to be treated as compromised and be discarded and new plans had to be outlined in a very short time, a gargantuan task.
This means that the relatively slow response by Israeli ground forces who took almost three days to get to the Gaza border is no surprise.
A well-equipped, fully mechanised army like the Israeli one certainly can recover the couple of hundred square kilometres of easy, flat land that Hamas took in its attack in a matter of hours, at most a full day.
So why were Israeli Merkava tanks not at the separation fences of Gaza on Saturday or Sunday?
There are several possible reasons and more will be known in time. But it is obvious that they could not count on forward operating bases closest to the border because those had been overrun and tanks and armoured personnel carriers that were meant to be first responders were destroyed or captured by Hamas.
Israel surely has lots of reserves, one would argue, could it not deploy them faster in such a small country? It could, if it did not have to count on the possibility of being forced to use its soldiers and equipment elsewhere.
As mentioned, more will be known in time about how events unfolded. For now, the analysis has to be marked as: to be continued

Gaza graduates demand UNRWA solutions for high unemployment rate

Gaza City - Since her graduation 10 years ago, Amal Shanioura has been searching for a suitable job opportunity in business administration, but has had no success.
The 32-year-old's frustration took her last week to a protest in front of the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Refugees (UNRWA), where demonstrators demanded the body provide more job opportunities in Gaza, and an end to the blockade imposed on the enclave by Israel.
Dozens of graduates participated in the protest, raising slogans denouncing the   and the lack of job opportunities amid a sharp rise in the Gaza unemployment rate, which, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, is higher than 45 percent. The United Nations has said that 81 percent of the population is living in poverty.
Youth unemployment statistics, which cover 19 to 29-year-olds, are particularly stark when it comes to comparing the occupied West Bank to Gaza – 32 percent in the West Bank are unemployed, compared with 70 percent in Gaza.
'Like any graduate, I volunteered in several places and institutions related to my specialty to no avail,' Shanioura told Al Jazeera. 'I also worked in some jobs intermittently, but they soon ended and I rejoined the ranks of unemployment.'
'As a citizen, I have the right to obtain a suitable job opportunity, especially from UNRWA, which offers permanent or temporary employment programmes for graduates.'
Iman Al-Qarinawi's three siblings are graduates with no jobs [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]
Harsh reality
Iman al-Qarinawi, 24, who graduated from the College of Pharmacy two years ago, told Al Jazeera that she had never imagined that her efforts during five years studying at university would be in vain.
'I graduated with a high average [grade] and have sufficient skills and experience to join the labour market, but the reality in Gaza is harsher than all expectations,' al-Qarinawi said.
'I volunteered to work in several private pharmacies but was unable to obtain a job opportunity,' al-Qarinawi added. "I feel very frustrated with the situation in Gaza."
Al-Qarinawi has three other siblings, all graduates in different fields, and all of whom are unemployed and sitting at home.
'The issue of unemployment has become more like a general phenomenon in the homes of the Gaza Strip," she added. "Almost every home has two or three unemployed graduates.'
No jobs, no hope
Salah Abdel Ati, a Gaza-based legal and economic researcher, told Al Jazeera that university graduates should be in a position where they can expect to have job opportunities, but that Israel's blockade of Gaza since 2007 had severely damaged the enclave's economy.
Abdel Ati said 180,000 students graduate annually from universities in Gaza, entering a job market where opportunities are few and far between.
'Since refugees represent 70 percent of the population [in Gaza], UNRWA is required to provide them with job opportunities and operational programmes, especially in light of the difficult economic conditions,' he said.
According to Abdel Ati, local estimates indicated that about 200,000 graduates in Gaza are unemployed and unemployment rates are increasing.
Directing his message to the commissioner-general of UNRWA, Abdel Ati demanded the creation of an emergency programme for graduates in the Gaza Strip.
'Youths need development projects and to be provided with soft loans that help them build their future,' he added.
UNRWA did not respond to a request for comment from Al Jazeera. However, on Monday, the body's media adviser in Gaza, Adnan Abu Hasna, said in a statement that UNRWA needed $190m until the end of the year to overcome a budget deficit.
That includes funding to cover staff salaries, as well as "$75m for food coupons in Gaza because they are a lifeline for the people", Abu Hasna said.
According to the World Labour Organisation, the unemployment rate in Gaza is among the highest in the world. "Almost every second economically active Gazan is out of work … two-thirds are unemployed and few can find a job," the organisation said in a report released this year.
The  , which has faced   since Hamas took over the territory in 2007, is also evidenced by the more than half of the Palestinians in Gaza who rely on humanitarian aid, and the nearly one-third of households who have been categorised as experiencing "catastrophic" or "extreme" levels of need.
The conditions in the Gaza Strip, closed off from the outside world in an area 365 square kilometres (141sq miles) big, have forced many Gaza Palestinians to think about something that is notoriously difficult for them – leaving.
Musbah Mukhaimer, 29, studied health administration and has worked as a volunteer in a number of governmental and private facilities, but he has not been able to obtain a stable job opportunity.
'A young man my age is in dire need of work in order to build his future, get married, and raise a family, but life in Gaza does not guarantee even the basics,' Mukhaimer said.
Mukhaimer called on UNRWA to activate programmes to re-employ graduates, stressing that "Palestinian youth have the right to live a decent life like the rest of the world.'
'We need job-creating programmes and training that support graduates in obtaining job opportunities and providing a decent life for them and their families.'

November 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel and Hamas are believed to be negotiating a deal to free dozens of   in exchange for a three-day ceasefire, according to the Reuters news agency and Axios, a US-based digital publication. Qatari mediators are seeking to negotiate the deal, which could also see the release of some Palestinian women and children from  .
Here are the details:
What do the reports say?
The deal is still under discussion in coordination with the United States – a close ally of Israel – some of whose citizens are among the captives.
Part of the deal includes the release of about 50 civilian captives in Gaza, a rapid jump from previous reports that suggested Hamas would release  . Hamas would also have to divulge the complete list of remaining living civilian hostages held in Gaza, according to an official briefed on the negotiations.
Israel too would release some Palestinian   and children from  . However, how many would be released is not known yet. Israel would also increase the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza, the official said.
Qatar, where Hamas operates a political office, has a direct line of communication with both Israel and Hamas and has previously worked on negotiating truces between the two. Qatari mediation efforts have so far led to the release of four out of around 240 hostages who Israeli officials estimate were taken by Hamas on October 7.
The Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the deal.
US President Joe Biden said that he was "mildly hopeful" that there would be a deal to free Hamas-held captives on Wednesday.
What did Israel say?
There was no immediate response from Israeli officials, who have previously declined to provide detailed comment on negotiations to release the captives.
But the official involved in the negotiations said that Israel has not agreed to the terms of the deal and is still negotiating the details.
Meanwhile, Israel has continued to bombard Gaza and its forces raided the al-Shifa Hospital – the enclave's largest medical facility. The Israeli military assault has so far killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, around 40 percent of them children, with more buried under the rubble.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that "we have been working relentlessly for the release of the hostages, including using increased pressure since the start of the ground incursion".
He has been under pressure from the families of the captives, who have urged the government to negotiate their release.
What did Hamas say?
Izzat El Rashq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, did not directly confirm the deal under discussion when asked by Reuters. There was also no immediate comment from the Hamas political office in Doha.
Thai Muslim politicians said on Thursday they had received assurances from Hamas that all the Thai hostages being held would be among those released if mediators succeed in brokering a truce in Gaza.
Hamas's armed wing, the  , said on Monday that it had told Qatari negotiators it was willing to release up to 70 women and children in return for a five-day truce, according to Reuters.
How many captives have been released so far?
Four captives have been released so far after negotiations through diplomatic channels with mediation from countries that have included Qatar and Egypt.
On October 20, Hamas   - US citizens Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, 17 - saying it was for 'humanitarian reasons'.
On October 23,   - Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85 - were also released.
According to the Israeli military, a fifth person, a soldier, Private Ori Megidish, was rescued on October 30 during a ground raid inside Gaza.
Citizens of Russia, the United States, France, Spain, Italy, Thailand, Germany, Argentina and the Netherlands are believed to be among those in Hamas captivity. Thailand is in talks with Iran and other governments to secure the release of 23 of its citizens held in Gaza.

US officials to meet Jewish leaders as anti-Semitism surges on campuses

Officials from the administration of US President Joe Biden have voiced alarm at a rise in anti-Semitism at United States universities and plan to meet with American Jewish leaders to discuss steps to counter the surge.
Tensions between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups have sprung up on college campuses due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
Last week, the Anti-Defamation League reported a nearly 400 percent spike in US anti-Semitic incidents overall since October 7, when Hamas attacked southern Israel and Israel launched a bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip.
Of the 312 incidents between October 7 and October 23, about 190 were related to the war.
On October 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel by breaching the Israeli security barrier around Gaza. At least 1,400 people were killed in the attack, and more than 200 were taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.
Since the attack, Israel has carried out a devastating bombardment and imposed a "complete siege" on Gaza. More than 8,000 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to Gaza officials.
Amid the soaring death toll and warnings from United Nations officials and aid agencies of a humanitarian catastrophe, tens of thousands of people have held protests around the world to demand a ceasefire.
US Vice President Kamala Harris's husband, Douglas Emhoff, will join Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and other officials to discuss how the Biden administration can respond.
Monday's meeting will address steps the administration 'is taking to counter the alarming uptick in reported instances of anti-Semitism on campus', a White House official said.
The Jewish leaders include representatives of the campus Jewish organisation Hillel, the Anti-Defamation League and the National Council of Jewish Women, the official added.
Over the weekend, threats were posted online to Jewish students and the Cornell Center for Jewish Living at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, according to the student newspaper and the campus Hillel group.
The FBI said it was aware of the threats made at Cornell.
In a statement, the FBI said, 'We take all threats seriously and are working closely with Cornell and our law enforcement partners at every level to determine the credibility, share information, and take appropriate investigative action.'
Meanwhile, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said last week that it had received 774 complaints of incidents driven by Islamophobia and bias against Palestinians and Arabs since October 7. The group said this was the highest level since 2015.
Last Thursday, Biden hosted a meeting with a handful of Muslim leaders, a White House official said, adding that the administration officials continue to meet with Arab and Muslim community members about the conflict and its repercussions.

The people of Gaza are exhausted and would dearly love to sleep deeply, be warm, look for missing family, perhaps play outside, and maybe go see what's left of their house. As Palestinians wait with bated breath for a pause in the Israeli bombardment, we look at the Middle East this week:
'We want to grieve'
Hoping to dodge bombs while hunting for enough food to keep your family alive for one more day has been the reality for the people of Gaza for more than six weeks.
Now, the people who spoke to Al Jazeera said, they are hoping that a 'humanitarian pause' in Israel's bombing, brokered by Qatar, will give them a chance to  , even if it's just for a few days.
An exchange of captives is planned for the pause, with families of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails   to be released by Israel.

A war on hospitals

Tehran, Iran - Iran has unveiled an upgraded version of its hypersonic missile in a military exhibition for the country's supreme leader.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday visited a university run by the aerospace division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Tehran, where a more advanced version of the   was put on display along with an array of arms, including the Iranian-made Gaza drone.
A new version of the   and an upgraded version of the 9-Dey missile defence system, capable of launching short to medium-range projectiles, were also unveiled.
The IRGC in addition displayed a new missile defence system called Mehran, which is said to employ solid-fuel missiles.
Iran had first unveiled the missile in June, joining a small club of countries, including China and Russia, which have weapons capable of travelling long distances with strong maneuverability.
The Iranian state media said the Fattah II missile is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), a projectile that glides to its target after the initial launch, offering substantially more maneuverability compared to a ballistic warhead travelling in a more predictable arc pattern.
No more information was provided on the upgraded version on Sunday, but Iran had said Fattah is capable of moving at a speed of up to Mach 15 (5.1 km or 3.2 miles per second) with a range of 1,400km (870 miles).
IRGC officials had said in June that the elite force could   to 2,000km (1,242 miles), which would effectively cover the distance to Iran's regional archenemy, Israel.
The Iranian supreme leader on Sunday again condemned Israel and its Western allies for their war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 12,000 Palestinians, nearly half of them children.
Khamenei said 'the Zionist regime is a symbol of racism', adding that Western backing for the weeks-long bombing of the enclave means Western leaders 'also believe in racism and see nothing wrong with it'.

He said   indicate anger on the part of Israeli leaders due to their 'failure' in defeating Palestinian fighters.
'The Islamic governments must sever their political relations with the Zionist regime at least for a limited time,' Khamenei said, also calling on the Muslim states to cut the flow of energy and goods to Israel.
The Iranian military show of force came as the United States moved considerable military assets, including two carrier strike groups and a nuclear submarine, to the region.
Under the umbrella of the Iran-backed 'resistance axis' of political and armed groups across the region, Lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthis have been engaged in cross-border fighting with Israel since last month in solidarity with Hamas fighters.
Israel on Sunday said the Houthis seized a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo ship in the southern Red Sea, describing the indent as an "Iranian act of terrorism".

Yemen's Houthi rebels seize cargo ship in Red Sea, Israel blames Iran

November 19th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Yemen's Houthis say they have taken control of an Israeli-owned ship in the southern Red Sea, with Israel describing the incident as an "Iranian act of terrorism" with consequences for international maritime security.
A Houthi military spokesman confirmed to Al Jazeera on Sunday that its fighters hijacked the British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo ship.
At least 22 people were onboard the Galaxy Leader – reported to be partly owned by an Israeli businessman – which was en route from Turkey to India.
"We have received confirmation from a Houthi official that they hijacked this ship. Earlier today [Sunday], they announced the beginning of operations to attack Israeli-flagged ships. They warned international sailors not to work for such companies," said Al Jazeera's Mohammed al-Attab, reporting from Yemen's capital, Sanaa.
The Houthis, backed by Tehran, have launched several missile and drone   since the latest assault on the besieged Gaza Strip began on October 7, killing more than 12,300 Palestinians, including 5,000 children.
'The Houthis have carried out a number of attacks on Iranian targets. We are expecting more attacks in the coming days,' al-Attab said.
The Israeli government called the hijack "a very serious event on a global level", with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office saying Israel was not involved in the ship's ownership, operation or the makeup of its international crew.
"This is another Iranian act of terrorism that represents an escalation in Iran's belligerence against the citizens of the free world, with concomitant international ramifications vis-a-vis the security of global shipping routes," said a statement released by the prime minister's office.
"There were no Israelis on the ship," it said, adding the 25 crew members are from Ukraine, Mexico, the Philippines and Bulgaria, among other countries.
A United States defence official said the US is "aware of the situation and closely monitoring it".
"What we understand is that the shipping company is partly owned by an Israeli businessman and this wouldn't be the first time one of his ships was intercepted. In 2021, one of his vessels was also targeted," said Al Jazeera's Sara Khairat, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem.
Al Jazeera's Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said there has been no evidence put forth by Israel that Iran is behind the hijack.
"This is an accusation made by the Israeli prime minister's office without any concrete evidence to support it," she said.
The war in Gaza has sent tensions soaring in the region, with international organisations and political leaders warning of a potential  .
"Iran in the past has distanced itself from these various armed groups in the Middle East that are against Israel," Jabbari said.
"But given Israel's continuous bombardment of Gaza and what they call 'genocide' against the Palestinian population, the Iranians are saying the conflict could spread."

Analysis: Will Israel attack Gaza on the ground and if so, when and how?

October 19th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
For nearly two weeks following Hamas's attack, the Israeli response has been to bomb the Gaza Strip relentlessly from the air.
But as time passes, the world is asking: Will Israel attack on the ground and, if so, when and how?
It is almost certain that it will.
Israeli politicians have been talking war so strongly that it is unimaginable that anything could persuade them to pause, stop or step back. Bitter political enemies have set aside their differences to demonstrate one mind, calling for retaliation, retribution and a solution to what they call the Hamas security problem.
Despite their tactical and strategic differences,nearly all Israeli politicians support a ground attack by Israeli forces on the Gaza Strip. They see that public opinion, in near-unison, calls for the humiliation of October 7 to be avenged in blood. So far, the payback has mostly been the blood of Palestinian civilians, but there is a desire to go into Gaza and kill as many fighters as possible.
So how does Israel plan to carry out a ground invasion – and what is it waiting for?
An attack takes time
It is difficult for an army that has suffered a tactical defeat and  to act immediately. To be ready to attack, the Israeli military needs to plan, equip, deploy and supply, and this takes some time.

Several reliable open sources indicate that Israel is straining to secure crucial military supplies to sustain a campaign that could last weeks or months, like its stocks of aerial bombs that need to be replenished before any new attack.
Well-informed rumours – and without independent confirmation we must call them that – claim that although Israel manufactures most of the ammunition and bombs it uses, the warehouses are not as full as logistics commanders would want. This lull is thus useful for the hurried acquisition of vital military hardware.
Generals know that the situation with reserves and supplies will never be ideal, and they are trained to recognise the moment when they have enough to go with without delaying the action too much. The Israeli military is probably close to a state of operational readiness that would allow it to launch a full Gaza offensive. That could be a matter of days at the most.
Israeli politicians must be already biting their nails and cursing soldiers for not having gone in already. They know – especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who many Israelis blame for leading the country in the wrong direction for years and disgracing their famed security and armed forces – that time is not on their side.
On October 7, and for days after, terrible scenes of civilians and disarmed soldiers being killed and hostages being taken galvanised support for Israel, including that of world leaders. Had it been capable of launching the ground offensive within 24 hours, Israel may have enjoyed worldwide support or at least a lack of strong opposition.
But very soon, the Israeli air attacks on Gaza, killing civilians and shattering neighbourhoods under unprecedented volumes of bombs, eroded much of that support.
Every day, more voices say that this has to stop, that this much killing is enough. At least   have been killed by Israeli bombardment; one-third of those were children.

After international outrage over the October 17  , which killed at least 471 people, Israeli decision-makers see their window of opportunity to act with international support rapidly closing and will probably attack soon, even if the military are not 100 percent ready.
A weekend ground invasion?
A possibly major factor influencing the decision when to attack is intelligence-gathering on the locations where captives are held.
Secret services want to scrutinise as many operational leadsas possible and gather as much information as possible, but they know they cannot have all the time they want.
I don't know when G-day will be and, taking an enormous gamble, I believe the main preparations are nearly completeand the attack may happen as early as the weekend.
History has shown that cunning decision-makers, who know how world politics tick, try to launch military campaigns that will trigger a strong response in the international community, on Fridays or Saturdays.
Why then? For a banal and simple reason: if the attacked side or its supporters and allies demand that the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) convene urgently, it is usually impossible to get the quorum before Monday morning New York time.
That gives the attackers more than two days before they may be cautioned or sanctioned by the UNSC, even though it usually does not act strongly in its first session.
The nature of the invasion is also predictable: Itis likely to be a massive, coordinated land, air and sea attack from multiple directions, probably launched in the middle of the night.
After all, Israel will try to put its advantages to best use while countering the strengths of the Palestinian defenders.

Israel conducts second ground raid into northern Gaza with air support

October 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Israeli army, backed by fighter jets and drones, has carried out a second limited ground raid into Gaza in as many days and struck targets on the outskirts of Gaza City, according to its military, as it prepares for a widely expected ground invasion.
The Israeli military said on Friday that ground forces entered Gaza overnight and struck dozens of Hamas targets during its raid in the Shujaiya area.
It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in the neighbourhood on the outskirts of Gaza City, and that its soldiers exited the territory after several hours without suffering any casualties.
'The raid began yesterday in broad daylight … it ended successfully in the hours of this morning,' the Israeli army's spokesperson said.
Black-and-white footage released by the Israeli army showed a column of armoured vehicles as a thick cloud of dust billowed into the sky after the strikes.
The army conducted a   using tanks and infantry the previous night in the northern part of the Palestinian territory; it said its ground forces battled fighters and struck antitank missile firing positions in an operation that lasted hours.
Israeli military officials, on several occasions, have confirmed the army's readiness to conduct a large-scale ground operation in Gaza, but are awaiting a green light from the Israeli political leadership.
At the same time, Israel continues its relentless  , which has killed more than 7,000 Palestinians in three weeks. The strikes began following a Hamas attack inside Israel on October 7, in which more than 1,400 people were killed.
The air raids have flattened entire neighbourhoods, causing a level of death and destruction unseen in the last four wars between Israel and Hamas.
More than a million people have fled their homes in northern Gaza, with many heeding Israeli orders to evacuate to the south, despite continuing Israeli attacks across the sealed-off territory.
Satellite photos
The damage to Gaza was shown in   of several locations taken before the war and again in recent days.
Entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos, reduced to smears of dust and rubble.
A complex of 13 high-rises by the sea was pounded to dust near Gaza City's al-Shati refugee camp, leaving only a few tottering bits of facade.
Just down the street, hardly anything remained in what had been a neighbourhood of low-built homes on winding lanes, according to the photos by Maxar Technologies.
Benny Gantz, a retired general and member of Israel's war cabinet, said on Thursday that any possible ground offensive would be only "one stage in a long-term process that includes security, political and social aspects that will take years".
"The campaign will soon ramp up with greater force," he added.
The humanitarian crisis caused by the war and the Israeli siege, and concern for the fate of Gaza's 2.3 million people, has sparked protests across the region, and more demonstrations were expected later on Friday after weekly Muslim prayers.

Israel's raid on al-Shifa Hospital: Here's what you should know

November 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli forces   Gaza's   after laying siege of the enclave's largest medical facility for weeks. Thousands of people are trapped inside, with decomposed dead bodies buried in a mass grave on the hospital premises. Here is what to know:
What is happening at al-Shifa Hospital?
Dr Ahmad Mokhallalati, a surgeon at al-Shifa who is currently in the hospital, told Al Jazeera that gunshots can be heard from all directions in the medical facility.
Dr Mokhallalati said 650 patients remain at the hospital, including about 100 in critical condition. There are 2,000 to 3,000 displaced Palestinians seeking shelter in the building. Additionally, there are 700 medical staff, he said.
Israeli forces have been calling doctors inside al-Shifa. 'You being inside the hospital will create a state of fear and hysteria among the patients here. The hallways are full of people, all floors are full of people,' Dr Munir al Barsh told an Israeli soldier in a call which was shared online.
The hospital also has 36   who were recently taken off their incubators because the station supplying them oxygen was destroyed in Israeli shellings three days ago, said Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Three babies have already died.
Those evacuated from inside the al-Shifa have been made to sit in the hospital's outdoor courtyard. They are forced to take their clothes off and are interrogated outdoors amid rain and cold weather, Mahmoud reported.
'Israeli forces have tried to kill anyone moving inside No one has done anything. We don't have any kind of resistance inside the hospital,' journalist Jihad Abu Shanab, who is inside the medical complex, told Al Jazeera.
'The bombing has been really really aggressive over the last nine hours with continuous shooting all over the area,' said Dr Mokhallalati. He also said that Israeli tanks can be heard approaching the hospital.
Where is al-Shifa hospital?
Al-Shifa is situated in Gaza City in the north, 500 metres (0.3 miles) from the Mediterranean coast.
It is a complex of buildings and courtyards a few hundred metres from Gaza City's small fishing port.
It is sandwiched between the Shati refugee camp and the city's Remal neighbourhood, which was destroyed in the initial days of the Israeli bombing that has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, including nearly 8,000 women and children.
Is there evidence for Israel's claims?
So far there is no concrete evidence of Israeli claims that the hospital was being used for military purposes by the Hamas armed group, which carried out an attack on Israel on October 7 and took more than 200 people captive. Israel has claimed that it is targeting Hamas assets.
Israeli forces are now saying that there is no indication of the presence of captives inside the hospital and the scan continues, reported Al Jazeera's Sara Khairat from occupied East Jerusalem.
Khairat added that this contradicts Israel's earlier statement when they said they knew exactly what they were going in for.
Israel carries the burden to produce evidence and prove that Hamas is using al-Shifa for military purposes, Ardi Imseis, an international law expert at Queen's University in Canada told Al Jazeera.
'The object of the attack is a civilian object. Until such time that the Israelis provide proof that it has been converted into a military object, the civilian nature of the object does not change,' he added.
Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera that 'the Israeli government has put forward no evidence that would justify stripping hospitals of their special protections under international humanitarian law'.
What has Hamas said?
Hamas   on Wednesday that the US announcement had effectively given a "green light" for Israel to raid the hospital. The group said it held Israel and the US President Joe Biden fully responsible for the operation.
Has has denied it has run military operations from any hospitals in the enclave of 2.3 million people.
A White House spokesperson for the National Security Council, who did not wish to be named, told the Reuters news agency it does not support attacking a hospital from the air and does not want to see a firefight in a hospital.
What has Israel said?
Israeli army spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told CNN the hospital and compound were for Hamas "a central hub of their operations, perhaps even the beating heart and maybe even a centre of gravity".
Israel said in its statement on Wednesday that it had given Gaza authorities 12 hours to cease military activities within the hospital. "Unfortunately, it did not," the military statement said.
While the Israeli military said on Wednesday that its forces have provided incubators and baby food to al-Shifa, the practicality of this is questionable. People have pointed out that the hospital needs electricity, which Israel cut, not incubators.
What's next?
Tamer Qarmout, assistant professor of public policy at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera that the al-Shifa raid was part of the bigger project for 'a forceful displacement of whoever is left in northern Gaza'.
With food and water supplies already running out, the destruction of the medical centre is a tactic to empty out the north, Qarmout explained.

Spain's election drama: Sanchez likely to be PM again, after Catalan deal

November 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will seek a new term in office in a vote in parliament on Thursday after striking a controversial deal with Catalan separatists.
In exchange for supporting Sanchez's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), nationalists from the Spanish region of Catalonia   a commitment from the PSOE leader to pass an amnesty law that would pardon those linked to the botched Catalan bid for independence six years ago.
More than 300 people accused of crimes in relation to Catalan independence between January 1, 2012, and November 13, 2023, could benefit from the legislation.
Those episodes included crimes during the unsanctioned October 2017 referendum, which Madrid met with a heavy police crackdown,
Will Sanchez be re-elected?
Sanchez - prime minister of Spain since 2018 - lost out to the centre-right PopularParty (PP) in the general election four months ago.
But unable to form a government, PP was forced to concede to the PSOE which has enlisted the support of Catalan and Basque nationalists and other regional parties in its bid to govern.
'I think [Sanchez] has the numbers so barring some unforeseen circumstance - which I don't think is likely - then Pedro Sanchez will [again] be Spanish prime minister by the end of Thursday,' said Andrew Dowling, a reader in Hispanic studies at Cardiff University.
Why does the support of Catalan nationalists matter?
Sanchez's decision to court the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) and the centre-right Junts per Catalunya - parties which support independence for Catalonia - has outraged Spanish conservatives, who decried the amnesty bill.
This despite one minister in the Spanish government, presidency minister and PSOE senior official Felix Bolanos, hailing the legislation as a way to 'heal wounds and resolve the existing political conflict in Catalonia'.
Indeed, following news of Sanchez's decision to pursue legislation intent on pardoning Catalans accused of political sedition, thousands of protestors took to the streets of Spain on Sunday to express their opposition.
On Tuesday, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, the leader of PP, appealed to the European Union itself to intervene, calling the proposed law 'an unprecedented situation'.
He complained that 'the amnesty [bill] is a direct payment for the votes needed for the [PSOE] to form a government. And who pays for that? The Spanish people, but also, in my opinion,Europe, because the deterioration of a democracy like Spain's … will obviously have consequences for European institutions'.
Among those who could be pardoned is former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, the leader of Junts and the brains behind the illegal referendum, who today lives in exile in Belgium.
What will Sanchez's likely re-election mean for Spain's domestic future and foreign policies?
Public hostility towards the amnesty bill is suggested by a recent poll which indicated that 70 percent of the Spanish electorate oppose the legislation. The judiciary, too, has signalled its opposition, meaning that simply passing the bill in parliament might not be enough for Sanchez to fully make good on his pledge.
However, on the international front, a newly re-elected Sanchez is unlikely to soften his criticism of Israel's military action in Gaza. On Wednesday, the leftist leader condemned the Jewish state for its 'indiscriminate killing of Palestinians' in the enclave - and vowed to 'work in Europe and in Spain to recognise the Palestinian state'.
In contrast to the likes of the US, the UK and Germany, Sanchez also called for an end to the massacre of Palestinians in Gaza where more than 11,300 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in retaliation for the Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7.
'We demand an immediate ceasefire on the part of Israel in Gaza and strict compliance with international humanitarian law, which today is clearly not respected,' he said.
Dowling, author of the 2022 book, Catalonia: A New History, told Al Jazeera that a second-term Sanchez government would also continue to be part of a 'mainstream Europe' which has sought 'to isolate the far-right'.
'Spain is very much a mainstream political actor within a European context,' said the academic. 'And also plays a very important role with North Africa and the Arab world. And also, for reasons of culture and history, with Latin America. So those are the kind of axis of Spanish foreign policy.'

Abbas condemns Israel for 'hideous war massacre' after Gaza hospital attack

October 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said Israel crossed "all red lines" by targeting al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, calling the attack that killed at least 500 people a "hideous war massacre" that cannot be tolerated.
Abbas said on Wednesday morning that any talks about anything other than stopping the war was unacceptable.
"Israel has crossed all red lines … We will not leave nor allow anyone to expel us from there," he said.
Health authorities in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip said an Israeli air strike caused Tuesday evening's blast, while Israel's military attributed it to a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad armed group.
Abbas was in Jordan for a four-way meeting with US President Joe Biden, Jordan's King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, but pulled out following the attack.
Later, Jordan   the cancellation of the summit with the US and Egyptian leaders.
Biden will now visit only Israel and postpone his travel to Jordan, a White House official said.
Al Jazeera's Alan Fischer, reporting from Israel's Tel Aviv, said Biden's intention was to act as an honest broker and show more support for Israel, which he has done since shortly after the Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7.
"He also aimed to urge the Israelis to exercise caution in their operations in Gaza to minimise the humanitarian impact. This argument has become much more compelling after the events at al-Ahli Arab Hospital," he said.
"Clearly, he is entering a situation that is much more volatile than he expected. It may strengthen his hand when he argues with the Israelis, saying to the Israelis that there is a risk an extended operation in Gaza could erode the global support they had."
Victims mostly women and children
Al Jazeera's Safwat Kahlout, reporting from Gaza, said most of the victims of the attack on the hospital were women and children, citing the enclave's health officials.
He said the death toll was expected to rise as many bodies remained unidentified.
"In Gaza, at least five hospitals received warnings from Israel to evacuate. According to international law, hospitals are meant to be safe and off-limits to attacks. In Gaza, this principle is not upheld," Kahlout said.
Ashraf al-Qidra, a Health Ministry spokesperson in Gaza, told Al Jazeera that al-Ahli Arab Hospital is a historic hospital associated with the Anglican Church.
'It hosts many displaced families and patients. It became a shelter due to the Israeli assaults on Gaza,' al-Qidra said, adding that ambulance services were trying to extract bodies, including many of children.

'Not pro-Israeli': Decoding Putin's muted response to Hamas attacks

October 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Kyiv, Ukraine - 'I want to thank you, my friend, for what you have done,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin about four years ago.
His words followed Moscow's transfer to Tel Aviv of the remains of Zachary Baumel, an Israeli serviceman who had been missing in action since 1982, the time of the first Israeli-Lebanese war.
Netanyahu expressed nothing but gratitude to Putin, even though the Russian soldiers who discovered Baumel's remains were fighting for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, one of Iran's closest allies.
But now, as war rages in the Middle East again, Netanyahu may be feeling backstabbed by his 'dear friend' Putin.
Putin remained silent about the conflict for three days, offering no condolences to Tel Aviv and refraining from calling Netanyahu - even though at least four Russian nationals were reported killed and six more went missing.
Meanwhile, Russia's stance   did not allow the United Nations Security Council to achieve the unanimity needed to condemn Hamas.
Finally, on Tuesday, Putin broke his silence - only to decry the 'catastrophic' civilian deaths and lambast Washington's steps in the Middle East peace settlement.
'This is a vivid example of the failure of Middle East policies of the United States [as it] tried to monopolise the [peace] settlement," he said during a televised meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani.
'But, unfortunately, [the US] was not concerned about the search for compromises for both sides and, vice versa, promoted their own conceptions about how it should be done, [and] pressured both sides,' he said.
Moscow also refused to list Hamas as a 'terrorist' organisation following similar steps taken by France and the European Union earlier this week.
'We maintain contact with [both] sides of the conflict," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Wednesday. "Of course, Russia continues to analyse the situation and keeps its position as a nation that has the potential to participate in the settlement process.'
Analysts say the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Hamas - as well as a bigger war in the region - could benefit Moscow and its allies.
'What's happening in Russia's response to the terrorist attack speaks volumes about Putin's real sympathies, and they're not pro-Israeli,' Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany's University of Bremen told Al Jazeera.
Russia is a key player in the informal anti-Western coalition that includes Iran, North Korea and China - and has long tried to 'rock the Western boat', he said.
'So, it's very beneficial for Putin to distract attention and international aid, mostly American, from Ukraine, something [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy frankly fears in his statements,' Mitrokhin said.
On Monday, Zelenskyy said Russia was 'interested in triggering a war in the Middle East so that a new source of pain and suffering could undermine world unity, increase discord and contradictions, and thus help Russia destroy freedom in Europe'.
'We see Russian propagandists gloating,' he said in a video address. 'We see Moscow's Iranian friends openly supporting those who attacked Israel. And all of this is a much greater threat than the world currently perceives. The world wars of the past started with local aggressions."
The Middle East conflict could stall a settlement in Ukraine - and freeze pivotal economic ties within Eurasia, a Kyiv-based expert said.
'The attention and resources of Western allies would be dispersed,' Vyacheslav Likhachev told Al Jazeera. 'But, most importantly, the perspective of stabilisation in the macro-region would be strategically thwarted.'
A now-delayed peace deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel could have helped the establishment of a transport hub between India, the Middle East and Europe, he said.
The hub could have ushered a closer macroeconomic integration in Eurasia - something that contradicts the interests of Moscow and Beijing, he said.
'It's not beneficial for China, it's not beneficial for Russia," Likhachev said.
Russia and Hamas
Despite widespread speculation, no evidence of Moscow's direct involvement in Hamas's attack on Israel has surfaced.
But it is in Putin's interests for the new conflict to spread all over the Middle East, distracting the West and undermining aid to Ukraine, a London-based expert on Eurasia said.
'Putin's calculation is to cause the escalation of the conflict, to widen it geographically and to involve the entire Arab population of the Middle East,' Alisher Ilkhamov, director of Central Asia Due Diligence, a civil society organisation, told Al Jazeera.
And there is no love lost between Putin and Hamas either.
"Hamas for him is just part of the game, a tool, just like for other regional players," Sergey Bizyukin, a fugitive Russian opposition activist, told Al Jazeera. "The most important thing for him is not to make a mistake by touching Chinese investments in Israel."
Apart from distracting the world from Ukraine, such a war may cause oil and gas prices to skyrocket - providing Moscow with billions of dollars of extra income.
On Tuesday, Putin reiterated Moscow's decades-long call for Palestine's independence - saying it was the only way to settle the conflict.
'Even though calls for Palestine's independence are legitimate, by pointing at this agenda in today's context, Putin actually justifies the war crimes committed by Hamas," Ilkhamov said.
And some Israelis are adamant that Putin's friendship with Netanyahu was nothing but cynicism and hypocrisy.
'Anti-Semitism was a way of life in the KGB when Putin joined it' in the 1980s' Leningrad, now St Petersburg, Eduard Kauffmann, a 31-year-old Haifa resident with Russian roots, told Al Jazeera. 'He threw Bibi [Netanyahu] under the bus and never looked back.'
The history of Russia's relationship with Israel is complicated.
Moscow's ties to Syria, a close ally of Israel's archenemy, Iran, as well as Russia's support to the Palestinian cause date back to the Soviet era, when the Kremlin called Israel a 'Zionist warmonger' and severed diplomatic ties in 1967 over the Arab-Israeli war.
Communist Moscow backed left-wing, socialist fractions within Palestinian political circles, trained hundreds of Palestinian fighters and armed Egypt before the 1973 October War.
It also developed close ties with Hamas and welcomed its leaders in Moscow since the armed movement came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007.
Then-Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal (L) and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov shake hands as they meet in Moscow on February 27, 2007. Meshaal praised Russia's efforts to end a Western aid embargo on the Palestinian administration during the visit, intended to win support for a new unity government [File: Pool via Reuters]
But since more than a million ex-Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel after the 1991 Soviet collapse, changing the nation's demographics and electoral preferences, every major Israeli politician tried to cultivate ties with Moscow.
No one succeeded in this cultivation more than Netanyahu, whose personal relationship with Putin was more than once called a 'strange love affair'.
He travelled to Moscow a dozen times, and during one visit accompanied Putin to a ballet performance in the Bolshoi Theatre.
He defended his relationship, saying that it prevented a war between Moscow and Tel Aviv over the nations' collision of interests and fighter jets over Syria.
'I wouldn't call it a love affair. I would call it a question of interest,' the Israeli leader told CNN in October 2022.
'Starting a war between Russia and Israel, I didn't think was a good idea.'
The ties were not shattered even by Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine and a string of anti-Israeli steps Moscow has taken.
Moscow has in recent years threatened to close down the Russian branch of the Jewish Agency, an NGO that facilitated emigration to Israel, and accused the Israeli ambassador in Ukraine of 'whitewashing Nazism'.
And the Kremlin has continued to repeat its old and unevidenced mantra about the 'neonazi junta' in Kyiv led by Zelenskyy, even though he is an ethnic Jew whose grandfather lost his family in the Holocaust.
For Zelenskyy and several other Ukrainian officials, the picture is clear.
"We are certain that Russia is supporting, in one way or another, Hamas operations,' he told France 2 television channel this week without providing evidence. "Russia is really trying to carry out destabilising actions all over the world.'

Gaza Strip – In the Gaza Strip, children's ages are measured by how many Israeli assaults they have been through.
About half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million is under 18, and the current offensive is Israel's fifth major one in 15 years.
The constant trauma has resulted in four out of five children in Gaza living with depression, grief and fear, according to a2022 report  by Save the Children.
  struggle with suicidal thoughts and the   of witnessing the deaths of other children.
As the death toll mounts – about 500 children have been killed so far in seven days – parents try their best to create a sense of normalcy to help their children cope.
The current assault's nonstop bombing has killed more than 1,500 Palestinians in total, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.

Samah Jabr, a 35-year-old mother of four in Gaza City, is worried about her eldest son, Qusay, 13.
"He is very agitated and lashes out a lot these days. He jumps at any sound," she said. "He can't bear anyone speaking loudly, even if they're joking. I try to tell him that this war will end."
Jabr hugs Qusay as often as she can, holding him close and talking soothingly about what they will do after the war. She hopes this will give him the strength to get through this time.
"The sound of the missiles is terrifying, and our house shakes so hard," Jabr said.
She taught her children, who never leave her side, how to spot the light that accompanies a missile so they are prepared for the deafening sound that will follow.
In the southern city of Rafah, Ahlam Wadi says her son Omar, 10, sleeps with his hands covering his ears.
"I'm worried about him," the 30-year-old said. "I'm scared he will be damaged in the long run. I try to distract him by talking to him constantly, but he can only hear the bombs and missiles."
Wadi and her children stay together in one room, and her husband tries to distract them by telling them about his own childhood.
"He tells them that he lived through these events before he got married and that he was very strong and not afraid," she said.
"My second son, Saeed, who is seven, asks me whether I was also strong and fearless. I tell him I tried hard to be brave.
"I'm worried that he will have these panic attacks for the rest of his life," she said of the attacks that grip her little boy.
[Abedelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]
Fear of loss
Manal Salem, who lives in Gaza City, said she gets her three children to talk to their grandparents every day to tell them what they heard during the night and whether that scared them or they felt brave.
"Their grandmother tells them they must bear these difficult days because it is only temporary and that they will get through this war and be happy together again," Salem said.
"They reply by telling their grandparents to be safe because they love them so much and want to see them again."
Salem's daughter Mai, who is six, has separation anxiety because her father, a doctor who works in the Al-Shifa Hospital emergency room, doesn't come home every night.
"Mai thinks her dad will be hit by a missile whenever he's not at home with her," Salem said. "I keep reassuring her that he's fine, that she must stay strong.
"I also try to calm her down by letting her talk to her dad on the phone, but sometimes he can't respond because so many casualties are coming in."
[Abedelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]
In Khan Younis, Rawand Khalaf tries to distract her five children, nine to 14 years old, through play.
"I sit with all of them in one room and invent games with their toys, so they will not focus too hard on the sounds of explosions," Khalaf said.
'My kids have their toys with them all the time for comfort, and I keep telling them everything will be fine."
Her eldest son, Aaed, tells Al Jazeera that he cannot get the images of children killed or under the rubble out of his head, much less the images of injured children screaming in pain.
"I can't imagine how children with such small bodies can bear these huge missiles," he said. "I can't understand how nobody does anything to help them. The children of Gaza have a right to live.
"They took everything from us."
Displaced children
A child in war has all sense of security ravaged – and having to flee the familiarity of a home in the middle of the night as neighbours cry and scream in fear and missiles rain down piles trauma on trauma.
Naima Fares, who lives in heavily affected Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip, has been through this with her six children.
"We used to tell our kids there's no safer place than home," she said. "But this war has broken all the rules. On the second day, we ran out of our house with nothing, not even a change of clothes."
[Abedelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]
Fares did manage to grab an emergency bag with the family's documents.
"My kids are in such a shock since that night," she said, speaking from a United Nations school they took refuge in.
According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on Friday, more than 400,000 people had fled their homes in Gaza.
"No matter what I do to calm my children, being here doesn't help," Fares said. "The schools are crowded. There are so many families. The sound of missiles is still constant, and kids scream all day and night. We can't get a minute of peace or rest."
Palestinians in Gaza often take shelter in schools run by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) when fighting breaks out, but Fares's daughter Haneen says living in one is not making her feel secure.
"Every war, we have to come to UNRWA schools, but they're not safe. Missile shrapnel can fall everywhere," the 16-year-old said.
"I cried because I left my memories and everything I loved at home," she said. "I cried because I was afraid of losing my family while we ran in the darkness.
"It was terrifying. They killed my childhood and dreams. I don't have anything that makes me happy any more.'

Analysis: How Israel would fare in Gaza's tunnels, Part I

As everyone tries to read more into the announcement by Israel's prime minister that it may allow 'little tactical pauses' to let hostages out or aid in, fighting in Gaza continues.
Calls for a ceasefire, pause, or whatever term might appear in tedious international political haggling, are mounting from all sides but Benjamin Netanyahu and his hawkish unity government are trying very hard to avoid losing momentum, fearing that once stopped, their Gaza offensive would be much harder to restart.
In the days immediately after the  , shocked Israelis unified behind calls for revenge, rallying behind the government and military. But, a month later, that unity at all costs may have been shaken by scenes from the front lines where the Israeli army has little to show in the way of victory and destruction of Hamas.
The unyielding aerial bombing has   and caused almost unbelievable levels of destruction, but the number of Hamas fighters eliminated is unknown. Even if those attacks were to have killed 1,000 Qassam Brigade fighters, which is impossible to prove, the ratio must make many Israelis quite uneasy: an enormous military effort for little military gain.
The number of Israeli combat casualties is still low, about 30, considered acceptable, but how will society react if they start rising? Significantly more Israeli soldiers might die as the invading troops surrounding Gaza City – who have cut it off on the surface from the southern part of the Strip – take the battle underground, into the feared Hamas tunnels.
Digging and counter-digging
Digging tunnels for military purposes is a concept from the times of the first human settlements and it never ceased being used. Until the invention of gunpowder, tunnels served to enter defended castles or leave besieged towns without breaking out. Gunpowder gave tunnellers the ability to set off large explosions under their enemies' positions, to be followed by massive attacks that would take the territory.
This concept culminated in World War I, with Britain and Germany on the Western Front and Italy and Austria-Hungary in the Alps digging and counter-digging, exploding more than 1,000 tonnes at once in the largest explosions.
While tunnelling decreased among equally matched armies after World War I, it found new life when used by the underdogs in asymmetrical warfare. China used tunnels to defend itself from Japanese invasion in the 1930s.
Japan, recognising their effectiveness, started digging too. Applying modern digging and defensive techniques, Japan used tunnels extensively to defend occupied Pacific islands against Allied invasion, inflicting large casualties on the United States Marines and Allied forces, highly disproportionate to the defenders' numbers.
A generation later, the Vietcong fighting the US in Vietnam used tunnels to move around, or rather under, their enemies, escape encirclement in one spot and mount surprise attacks in others. Their tunnel network was vast: just in the southern region of Cu Chi, the US Army verified more than 320km (200 miles) of underground communications. Those 60-year-old figures make the Palestinian claims of 300-500km (186-310 miles) of tunnels under Gaza plausible.
Bantams, Rats and Weasels
Every nation or army that had to fight an enemy using tunnels quickly realised that regular soldiers were near-useless for that specialised task. They were not trained diggers, and many were uncomfortable in the claustrophobic dark, damp environment with bad air. In 1914, Britain started employing miners and training them for military tasks.
Then it created special Bantam troops made of soldiers whose short stature, under 160cm (5.25 feet), excluded them from serving in regular units. They did far better than usual troops, as did the 'Tunnel Rats' underground warfare specialists the US used in Vietnam.
When it first discovered and studied the Gazan tunnels, during the 2000-2005 first Intifada, Israel realised that danger from underground warfare would grow, and set out to create units fit for the role, starting with the Combat Engineers, known as Yahalom.
The Combat Engineers quickly realised that, despite their technical skills and specialised equipment, even more narrowly focused, armed and trained troops were necessary.
In 2004, the Weasels (Samur), the first Israeli tunnel-warfare commandoes, appeared. The specialists originate within the engineering corps and were trained in undercover assault techniques by Sayeret Matkal commandoes. They will certainly be the first Israeli troops in the Hamas tunnels.
Extending tunnels under the Strip
Tunnels under Gaza predate Hamas – to the 1980s when they were first dug under Egypt's border for smuggling. Palestinians in Gaza discovered that, except in the narrow belt along the coast where the soil was sandy and quite unsuitable for digging, the rest of Gaza's earth was clay-rich, easy to dig through and generally not requiring complex supports.
In time, Palestinians realised that the tunnels could have a military use and they employed the tunnellers to extend the network under Gaza.
When Hamas took over, the effort was given a strategic role and expanded. Most of the tunnelling was done by local civilian workers, who were allegedly paid better than average salaries for the gruelling work.
Operating beneath territory they controlled, Hamas did not have to worry about one of the greatest perils of tunnelling under or near the enemy: being located by the noise or vibration of digging. Free from that constraint, they are said to have worked quickly.
When it attacked Gaza in 2014, Israel was stunned at the extent of the tunnels, then believed to have surpassed 100km (62 miles), and their sophistication. It realised it had to speed up its underground warfare preparations.

EU seeks alternative delivery routes as it ramps up Gaza aid

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The European Union will increase its humanitarian aid for Gaza by 25 million euros ($27m).
The additional funds, which were announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday, will raise the bloc's aid fund for the bombarded enclave to 100 million euros ($108m). Brussels will now seek easier routes to get the aid into Gaza.
"The European Union will spend a total of 100 million euros in humanitarian aid for the civilians in Gaza," von der Leyen told EU diplomats in Brussels.
The Commission chief said flows of aid into Gaza from Egypt "remain too small" and the EU was working on setting up other possible routes, including deliveries sea from Cyprus.
Von der Leyen said it was essential that Israel, for whose actions she has offered staunch support, "strives to avoid civilian casualties", in its operation in Gaza.
"Hamas is clearly using innocent Palestinians and hostages as human shields – it is horrific and it is pure evil," she said, referring to the group that rules the enclave.
"Our hearts bleed at the images of small children pulled out from under the rubble."
Von der Leyen told diplomats that even as conflict rages, there needs to be a "perspective" for a two-state solution.
She insisted a prerequisite once the fighting stops is that "Gaza can be no safe haven for terrorists", and that Hamas will no longer be in charge of the territory. The EU designates Hamas as a terrorist organisation.
"Different ideas are being discussed on how this can be ensured, including an international peace force under UN mandate," she said.
Israeli forces pushed on with intense strikes targeting Palestinian fighters in Gaza on Monday, as the war neared one month's duration and the Hamas-run health ministry's death toll approached 10,000 inside the besieged territory.
Determined to destroy Hamas, whose October 7 attack left 1,400 dead in Israel and saw more than 240 hostages taken, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised no let-up despite mounting international calls for a ceasefire.
On Monday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell suggested a plan under which Israel could suspend its military operation in Gaza in return for the Red Cross getting access to captives held by Hamas.
'I think that a humanitarian pause counterbalanced by an access to hostages with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as a first step to their release is an initiative in which we should work,' Borrell told European Union diplomats in Brussels.
'Call it a truce, window, whatever, but we need that violence recedes and that international humanitarian law is being respected,' Borrell said.

Israel's police chief, Kobi Shabtai, has said there will be "zero tolerance" for protests in support of Gaza in Israel, threatening to send anti-war demonstrators to the besieged Palestinian enclave that Israel has been bombarding daily for nearly two weeks.
Shabtai's comments came in a video posted  on the TikTok channel of the Israeli police on Tuesday. Israeli media picked it up on Wednesday after police broke up a rally in Haifa  in support of Gaza, arresting six people.
"Whoever wants to become an Israeli citizen, welcome," Shabtai said. "Anyone who wants to identify with Gaza is welcome. I will put him on the buses heading there now."
In the short video, Shabtai also said there would be 'zero tolerance for any instance of incitement there will be no authorisation for protests'.
He said that Israel is 'in a state of war we're not in a situation where we will allow all sorts of people to come and test us'.
Israel Police spokesman Eli Levy told Army Radio on Wednesday that since the start of the Gaza war on October 7, 63 people in Israel have been arrested on suspicion of supporting or inciting "terror".
Police officials told the Ynet news site on Wednesday that they are scouring social media to find Palestinians in Israel who were expressing support for Hamas, the group running the besieged Gaza Strip.
Israel has imposed a  on Gaza, cutting off access to food, water, electricity and fuel for the strip's 2.3 million residents after Gaza-based Hamas fighters launched an attack into southern Israel on October 7. Israeli authorities say at least 1,400 people, most of them civilians, were killed in the attack, more than 4,400 were injured and  were taken captive by Hamas.
Since the attack, Israel has  Gaza from the air in a devastating campaign that has reduced entire neighourhoods to rubble. Palestinian authorities have said that more than 3,400 people have been killed and more than 12,000 others wounded in the Israeli assault.
'After Operation Guardian of the Walls [the 2021 war with Gaza, which saw many Arab-Jewish clashes in mixed towns], we learned our lesson, and established a 'war room' to counter such incitement," said Assistant Commissioner Dror Asraf.
"[Today, the operation] identifies online incitement or planning or any operational information that we identify on all the platforms, which has a goal of disrupting public order and harming others.'
Meanwhile, the ethics panel of the Israeli parliament has voted to suspend a left-wing parliament member, Ofer Cassif, for what it deemed as anti-Israel statements after the war broke out.
Cassif had given an interview in which he accused the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of enacting a plan in Gaza, which he compared with the Nazis' "Final Solution" against Jews in Europe.
On another occasion, he told foreign media that "Israel wanted this violence", in reference to the Hamas attack.
According to the Jerusalem Post, Cassif has been suspended for 45 days.
In a social media post published on Wednesday, Cassif called  the Knesset's decision "another nail in the coffin of freedom of political expression".
"In each of my interviews, I emphasised my complete condemnation and deep disgust for the criminal massacres by Hamas. The political statements against the occupation and the war are not statements against Israel, since peace and justice also serve it and its inhabitants," he said.

Will Israel's 'humanitarian pauses' mean much for Gaza? No, say experts

November 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
On Thursday, the White House announced that Israel has agreed to   in fighting in   to allow people to flee hostilities and for humanitarian aid to be let in.
Yet, within hours, Israel's bombing campaign had targeted Gaza's largest hospital, al-Shifa, and Israeli tanks had surrounded four other hospitals in the northern part of thebesieged enclave.
With more than 11,000 Palestinians killed and over 27,000 injured, the al-Shifa Hospital has received just two shipments of life-saving supplies since the conflict escalated. The facility is barely hanging on by a thread, with many others fettered shut due to the fighting and the Israeli siege on Gaza following Hamas's attack on southern Israel on October 7.
Meanwhile, Gaza is running short on water, many of its hospitals and other facilities are out of fuel, and a humanitarian crisis is deepening.
While the pauses could have offered some hope that hospitals might have been restocked, and other essential facilities could have received supplies, the attacks over the past 24 hours raise questions about Israel's intent, and that of the US, said many experts. The pauses are also inadequate, they said.
Both the US and Israel have made it clear that there will be no ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
Unilateral move
Emanuela-Chiara Gillard, a senior fellow at the Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict at the University of Oxford and an associate fellow at Chatham House, welcomed the humanitarian pause announcement but said it has gaping holes.
'I think that any announcement to suspend hostilities temporarily is positive in view of the situation on the ground and the needs,' Gillard told Al Jazeera. 'In the immediate short term, what is clearly needed is a temporary suspension of activities, to allow humanitarian actors to transit safely, to allow people to [receive] this humanitarian assistance.'
'The issue is that it is a unilateral rather than an agreed pause between Israel and Hamas and the other parties,' she added.
This raises the question of whether Hamas and other factions will respect the pause, as the Palestinian grouphas not committed to anything, Gillard said.
A third-party mediator should facilitate the agreement of pauses that would be respected by both sides, she added.
Gillard also said that Israel's communication of the details of the pauses is of outright importance, otherwise civilians making use of them could land in harm's way.
'Pauses are not a solution'
Other analysts said that a humanitarian pause falls short of what is needed, and that Israel needed to cease hostilities entirely.
"Pauses are not a solution," Abdel Hamid Siyam, professor of political science and Middle East studies at Rutgers University, told Al Jazeera, saying what is needed instead is a "ceasefire so that humanitarian aid can come in uninterrupted, that foreigners can leave the country, and maybe negotiations can take place'.
Siyam said that past directives by Israel have failed to protect civilians.
"If this is only a pause to allow people to move from the north to south, it did not work in the past, it will not work in the future," he said. "In four hours, people cannot come. They don't have cars, they don't have fuel. It's not going to work."
He said that a ceasefire, however, may be on the cards soon.
"There is mounting pressure on Israel now to open up for a real ceasefire, a real truce for a day or two or three. I think that is coming in the next few days," said Siyam.
Protecting Biden's interests
Meanwhile, the US has its own interests in pushing its ally for the pause, said Sami Hamdi, the managing director at International Interest, a political risk firm focusing on the Middle East.
'The pause is designed to be a vehicle through which the US can continue to support Israel's push to ethnically-cleanse the northern part of Gaza, but also be able to reframe and present that support to the raging global public as 'humanitarian',' Hamdi told Al Jazeera.
US President Joe Biden has come under pressure domestically, with  , and a letter from more than 500   protesting against his refusal to call for a ceasefire.
What will particularly worry him, Hamdi said, are polls suggesting that he is now trailing former US President Donald Trump in several battleground states.
Rising public pressure might also make the current US position of rejecting a ceasefire untenable soon and Biden will be forced to intervene to stop Israel's offensive, he said.
The delay in announcing the pause, however, also reflects growing tensions between Washington and Tel Aviv.
'Tel Aviv is concerned that the US push for a humanitarian pause is a ploy by which Biden hopes to lull Netanyahu into ceasefire talks, and has been adamant in demanding assurances that this is not the case," said Hamdi.
And Palestinians will fare no better with the pause, he said, forced still to choose between leaving their lands for Israeli settlers, or to remain and die.
For some organisations on the ground, it is too early to tell whether the humanitarian pause will be helpful.
'We'll see when - and if - it's implemented and then we will be able to comment,' Juliette Touma, UNRWA's director of communications told Al Jazeera.
'We continue to call for a fully-fledged humanitarian ceasefire across the Gaza Strip for the protection of civilians wherever they are, inside the Gaza Strip and elsewhere, for the sake of civilians for the sake of humanity,' she added.

Gaza hospital generators to run out of fuel in 48 hours: Health Ministry

The Ministry of Health in the Gaza Strip has warned that the electric generators in hospitals will cease functioning within the next 48 hours due to a fuel shortage, amid   by Israel on the besieged enclave.
Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said in a brief statement on Telegram early on Tuesday that the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza is "slow and cannot change the reality" on the ground.
"The healthcare system has reached its worst stage in its history," he added.
On Monday, the ministry said 32 health centres were out of service after Israel cut off access to essential supplies, including fuel, as it   that has destroyed entire neighbourhoods and brought humanitarian conditions to a breaking point.
It added that the immediate needs of hospitals must be prioritised in terms of aid distribution, urging the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to push for the delivery of supplies of fuel and blood units into the enclave.
The Indonesian Hospital, in northern Gaza's Beit Lahia area, was shut down as it could not carry out vital facilities after running out of power on Monday.
Footage verified by Al Jazeera showed the facility under darkness. Videos showed medical teams at the hospital receiving patients carried by ambulance workers while using portable flashlights. It was later reported that power was restored, but it was unclear for how long it would last.
Hope for more aid
Meanwhile, a convoy of humanitarian aid trucks delivered water, food and medicine to the Gaza Strip on Monday, the third since limited aid began flowing in on Saturday.
The UN says fuel was not included and reserves will run out within two days.
Al Jazeera's Hani Abu Isheba, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said residents were hoping that more aid trucks would be allowed into the besieged enclave.
He added that Palestinians living in the narrow strip of land were desperate for the bombardments to stop.
Israel started its intense   on Gaza after an assault by Hamas, the group running the enclave, inside southern Israel on October 7 that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
More than 5,000 Palestinians have been   in Israel's attacks, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which says about 40 percent of the victims are  .

Israel air raids kill eight soldiers in southern Syria: State media

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli strikes have killed at least eight soldiers in southern Syria, according to Syrian state media, in an attack that the Israeli army said was a response to earlier rocket fire.
Persistent   with Lebanon's Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah and allied Palestinian factions across Israel's northern borders with Lebanon and Syria in recent weeks have raised fears of a new front in   in the Gaza Strip.
Palestinian factions in Syria's south have exchanged cross-border fire with Israel several times since last week.
"Around 1:45am [22:45 GMT Tuesday], the Israeli enemy carried out an aerial aggression from the occupied Golan Heights," Syrian state media said on Wednesday.
The attack also wounded seven soldiers and caused material damage, it added.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor with a wide network of sources on the ground in the war-ravaged country, put the number of dead soldiers at 11, including four officers.
It said the attacks "destroyed arms depots and a Syrian air defence radar" and also targeted an infantry unit.
Attack from Deraa
On Tuesday evening, the Syrian Observatory had said "fighters loyal to Hezbollah", which fights alongside government forces in the Syrian conflict, had "launched rockets towards the occupied Syrian Golan" from Syria's southern province of Deraa.
The Israeli army said on Wednesday its "fighter jets struck military infrastructure and mortars belonging to the Syrian army in response to the launches towards Israel yesterday [Tuesday]".
Residents in Syria's Deraa province told the AFP news agency that Israeli planes dropped leaflets after the strike, warning the Syrian army and Palestinian factions against launching attacks towards Israel.
"Syrian commanders … bear full responsibility for operations … incoming from Syrian territory," the leaflets read, adding that every attack "on the state of Israel will be met with an iron fist".
On Sunday, Israeli strikes   Syria's two main airports, Damascus and Aleppo, Syrian state media said.
Israel has been bombarding Gaza since fighters of Hamas, the group that rules the Gaza Strip, attacked southern Israel towns on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 220 captives, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel has responded with withering air raids, killing 5,791 people so far, according to officials in Gaza. It has also imposed a near-total land, sea and air blockade of the enclave.
During more than 10 years of war in Syria, Israel has launched hundreds of air raids on its northern neighbour, primarily targeting Hezbollah fighters and other Iran-backed forces as well as Syrian army positions.
Israel rarely comments on individual strikes it carries out on Syria, but it has repeatedly said it will not allow its arch foe Iran, which supports President Bashar al-Assad's government, to expand its presence.
Israel occupied much of the Golan Heights in the 1967 war and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the United Nations.

Hamas had not planned to attack music festival, Israeli report says

Hamas fighters who   in Israel on October 7, killing hundreds, likely did not know in advance about the event and decided to target it on the spot, Israeli media has reported citing police and security sources.
According to a copy of the first Israeli police report into the attack, obtained this week by Israel's Channel 12, Palestinian fighters had originally intended to attack nearby kibbutz Re'im as well as other villages near the Gaza border. They found out about the music festival with drones and from the air as they parachuted into Israel.
Some 4,400 people had reportedly been at the event that Saturday when Hamas broke through Israel's high-security barrier - which includes radar system and underground sensors - and attacked military posts and villages in southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
This Saturday, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the 'growing assessment in Israel's security establishment' based on the police investigation and on interrogations of captured Hamas members, is that the group had not planned to target the event.
While police found maps of the target locations on the bodies of killed Hamas members, none was of the festival location. An additional finding supporting the assessment, according to Haaretz, was that Hamas militants did not approach the festival from the direction of the border but from a nearby highway.
In addition, the event had originally been scheduled to take place on Thursday and Friday, with Saturday added to the programme only on Tuesday that week.
The report also found that most of the festival goers had managed to leave the event by the time Hamas showed up and the massacre began.
'The large majority of [people who were at the event] managed to flee following the decision to disperse the event made four minutes after the rocket attack,' according to a senior police source quoted by Haaretz.
The police investigation also found that an Israeli military helicopter opened fire on the assailants but also hit some people attending the festival. No further details were provided, Haaretz reported.
'An investigation into the incident revealed an [Israeli military] combat helicopter that arrived at the scene from the Ramat David base fired at the terrorists and apparently also hit some of the revelers there,' the news report cited an unnamed police official as saying.
The police report also revised the death toll from the attack to 364, including 17 police officers, up from 270. It put the number of kidnapped festival-goers at 40.
In response to the Hamas attacks, Israel launched a   on the Gaza Strip that has killed more than  , including 5,000 children, according to Palestinian health authorities. Much of the Gaza Strip lies in ruins and a total blockade that Israel has imposed on the territory has left its residents unable to get enough food, water, fuel and medical supplies, all now at critically low levels.

Live on TikTok: Cousin of Palestinian activist beaten by Israeli soldiers

Hebron, occupied West Bank – Eyad Banat, 35, was live on TikTok when dozens of Israeli soldiers raided his home and violently beat him and other family members in the city of Hebron in the southern occupied West Bank.
The video, which was shared widely on social media, showed soldiers stepping on Banat, kicking him and pushing their rifles into his body with the sound of his children screaming "baba" (Dad) in the background.
"They grabbed my father and pushed him to the ground. They kept beating him on and on and then handcuffed him and took him," Banat's 10-year-old daughter, Sandy, told Al Jazeera from their home.
"I wasn't shouting because I was afraid of the soldiers. I'm not afraid of the soldiers. I was worried about my father. The soldier kept pushing the weapon into my father's neck. He took the crowbar and beat him on the head and on his hands with it," she continued.
The raid took place in the very early hours of Tuesday morning. Israeli forces arrested five members of the Banat family, including Eyad, along with nine labourers from Gaza who had been staying with the family after getting stuck in the occupied West Bank.
The nine labourers, as well as three members of the Banat family, remain in Israeli custody.
Eyad Banat, one of those released, is the cousin of the late political activist Nizar Banat, who was   by Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces on June 24, 2021.
Recalling the raid on his home, Banat said he was assaulted in the same way as his cousin.
"You all know what happened to the martyr Nizar Banat. I saw Nizar's face when they were beating me. Even though it was occupation soldiers doing it, it's still the same method [that the PA used]," the father-of-six said.
"What appeared in the video is nothing compared to what happened away from the camera," he told Al Jazeera from his home.
'You shouldn't be alive!'
Banat had appeared live on TikTok at about 1:30am (23:30 GMT) as he does every night as part of an online campaign to raise financial aid for children in the besieged Gaza Strip.
For 41 days, the enclave has been under a relentless aerial and ground bombardment by Israeli military forces which has killed more than 11,500 people, the majority of them women and children. The military assault was launched on October 7 after fighters from Hamas, the Gaza-based armed resistance movement, staged an unprecedented attack inside Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 200 captive.
Residents of the Strip are now facing a dire humanitarian crisis with severe water, fuel and electricity shortages as well as the spread of disease.
"A friend of mine and I go live on TikTok, along with a journalist friend of ours in Gaza," said Banat. "We provide assistance to children in the yard of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, such as tents and blankets. It is so unfortunate that 22 [Arab] countries are not able to bring one bottle of water into Gaza. People are receiving shipments of expired biscuits and white burial sheets!"
"When I was live, I realised the army was surrounding my house. I told the guys to stay live," he said.
"The army raided all our homes and blew up three front doors. They assaulted every member of the Banat family – my cousins, my uncle and his sons, my brother. They assaulted us with their hands, legs, weapons and crowbars," continued Banat.
"They were beating my uncle, who has heart problems. The soldier was telling him, 'you shouldn't be alive'," he said.
The Banat family men were then handcuffed and taken for interrogation outside their homes, during which the beatings continued. Two hours later, soldiers left a number of them, including Banat, on different roads away from their homes. They were then taken by medics to the Princess Alia Governmental Hospital in Hebron for treatment.

The price 'honourable people must pay'
Since October 7, the Israeli army has increased raids on Palestinian neighbourhoods, cities and villages across the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. At least 2,570 people have been arrested, according to prisoner rights groups.
Commenting on being assaulted in front of his children, Banat said they are "used to it" due to the frequent raids by the Israeli army and PA security services.
"We are an occupied country. This the price that honourable people have to pay," he said, adding he was "just glad that I was released".
"Gaza is our dignity and our pride. It is fighting all the Western countries – on behalf of 22 Arab countries," he continued.
"What happened to us is nothing compared to what is happening to the Gaza Strip. May God keep us strong to be able to stand with our people in Gaza – because those are our family, our children, our friends. We are the sons of one nation."

To kill a family: The loss of Wael Dahdouh's family to an Israeli bomb

November 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Wael Dahdouh stood facing away from the camera for once, leaning against the wall to hide his tears.
He was at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital to bid a final farewell to his wife, son, daughter and grandson who had just been killed in an Israeli air raid that hit the house they were sheltering in.
When he turned to face his audience, it was to be interviewed by a colleague, the same way he had interviewed so many others before.
He composed himself and started to talk, but when it came to counting the people he had lost, his voice gradually lost assurance. Then it broke. Tears filled his eyes as he mentioned his seven-year-old daughter Sham, the second-youngest of the victims.
The youngest was Wael's grandson, Adam, who was one and a half.
"My siblings and cousins were there, too, and my daughters are all injured," he said. "But I suppose I should thank God that at least some of my family survived."
'The reality of life in Gaza'
The home where Wael's family was attacked was not theirs – their home was back in Tel el-Hawa in Gaza City but they had to leave it because it was too dangerous.
Wael Dahdouh barely held back his tears at the hospital where he went to see his family [Al Jazeera]
Wael, 52, was working night and day covering the news of what was happening in Gaza City. He worried about his family, with the relentless bombing that was happening in the north of the Gaza Strip.
So his wife Amna and their children, some with their spouses and children of their own, moved from place to place until they ended up in Nuseirat refugee camp south of Wadi Gaza with some other family members.
Wael thought they would be safe there because it was within the zone to which Israel had asked Palestinians in Gaza to move.
It's a difficult moment in the life of a Palestinian journalist, when they go to cover an incident for the news and find out that the news is their own family.

Wael and Amna had eight children: Hamza, 27, Bissan, 25, Sundus, 23, Khuloud, 21, Batoul, 18, Mahmoud, 15, Yehia, 12, and seven-year-old Sham.
Hamza and Bissan were not in the house, but they rushed to the scene. Their mother, Mahmoud and Sham were gone, Yehia was badly injured, and the rest of their siblings were injured to varying degrees. Adam, their sister Sundus's son, had also died.
Two years ago, during Israel's 11-day bombardment of the Gaza Strip, Wael's family had survived an attack on a house next door, and he told AJ+ Arabic at the time that the family had split up among several family members' homes "in hopes that some of them would stay alive; this being the reality of life in Gaza".
'I knew the size of the anguish'
Wael loved being a father. He'd follow up on   and would rush between live reports to run errands for them.

"I know he loves his family a great deal and they occupy a huge place in his heart, it's different from any other paternal relationship I've observed among my colleagues," Abdisalam Farah, an Al Jazeera Arabic presenter in Doha, explained.
Farah could not hold back his tears as he read the breaking news of Wael's loss off his teleprompter because, he said, "I knew the size of the anguish that was gripping my colleague's heart at that time."
Wael had put the worry he felt into words before, "For our families, that moment, that moment when they need you the most, when they need the strength and steadiness of the father – that moment is lost for us Palestinian journalists. When they need you the most is when they miss you the most," he told AJ+ Arabic in 2021.
And, on the evening of October 25, his worst fears came true.
He heard the news live: as he was delivering a report, his surviving family members had been trying to get hold of him. Eventually, his daughter, Khuloud, managed to get through to cameraman Hamdan al-Dahdouh, who passed the phone to Wael, on air.
His colleague, Hisham Zaqout, was working out of the hospital and had heard the news but when Wael called him to say he was coming straight there, Hisham told him to go to the house instead.

"I mean, I suppose I wanted to make it less painful for him. And the civil defence teams sometimes can't get everywhere at night in Gaza, so he may have been needed to help dig through the rubble," Hisham said.
When Wael and Hamdan arrived at the scene, they immediately started digging through the rubble with their bare hands. They managed to rescue Wael's son Yehia, who was badly wounded, and his daughter Batoul. He was also able to get his grandson Adam out. But it was too late to save him.
'She was everything in that home'
Wael did not see his wife in the rubble, as her body had already been moved to the hospital, where he and his eldest son Hamza were able to see her.
Hamza was very attached to his mother, and as soon as he got the call telling him the house had been hit, he cried out his worry about her, according to his colleague Bilal Khaled who was with him that night.
"Um Hamza, God rest her soul, was everything in that house to Hamza, to Hamza's father, to the whole family. Their attachment to her, how they talked about her. She was not just a mother, she was everything in that home for them," Bilal told Al Jazeera.
"Just earlier that day, Hamza had been talking to her, asking her how she was doing, checking on whether they had managed to find any bread that day. He checked on his wife and on his nephew, little Adam," Bilal continued.
At the hospital, Wael was not able to mourn privately and chose to present his pain and the loss of his family to viewers as part of the pain felt by the people of Gaza every day.
Cameras followed him as he walked into an overflow area where the bodies that could not fit inthe hospital morgue were lined up on the floor.
They hovered as he pulled back the makeshift shroud covering his son Mahmoud and touched his face and torso, stunned that his child was gone.
Mahmoud was "a boy just blossoming into his manhood. He used to hang around with us a lot, always with a joke or some teasing remark for someone on the news team," Hisham said.
"And his daughter, little Sham only seven, who committed no crime other than being the daughter of Wael Dahdouh," he continued, adding that Wael had described it as "an attempt to exact revenge on us by targeting our children".
Hamza was very attached to his mother and to his little nephew, Adam [Al Jazeera]
'A family of giants'
The tributes that came pouring in reflected the love and respect everyone around Wael felt for him – and the shock they all shared at the news of his loss.
Ahmed Ashour, one of Wael's colleagues in Doha, described how at the end of the "long, traumatising day" when "our hearts were ripped out by the news about his family", he went home and "oddly enough, realised I was hungry". As he opened his kitchen cabinet in search of something to eat, he saw the bottle of Palestinian olive oil Wael had sent him. "It was such a heart-rending moment," he recalled.
For Hamdan, who was with Wael when he got the news and who helped dig through the rubble with him, "it is a huge loss." But, he explained, Wael "is also a giant and comes from a family of giants". Describing him as an older brother and a source of strength and patience, he added, "May God give you patience and strength as big as the love for you that he has planted in the hearts of people around the world."
Asif Hamidi, the head of Al Jazeera Arabic TV news, described how "Wael has covered and continues to cover life in Gaza to show the world. By doing so, he has shown us all how strong this man is and how capable of working past his pain. He will not forget this pain, it will remain within him, for he lost his wife, his son, his daughter, and his grandson."
But, he added, Wael "looked beyond the catastrophe that befell him as if he was telling us that it is the tragedy of the Palestinian people that needs to be covered."

Thousands of people have taken to the streets in Israel as pressure mounts on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his government's lack of preparedness for the October 7 attacks by Palestinian group Hamas and its handling of the ensuing captive crisis.
Police held back hundreds of protesters outside Netanyahu's residence on Saturday. Waving blue and white Israeli flags, demonstrators chanted "Jail now!" as a crowd pushed through security barriers.
In Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv, several thousand protesters, including relatives and friends of some of the captives, chanted: "Bring them home now".
"I expect and demand from my government, think out of the box," said Hadas Kalderon, who said five members of her family were among the kidnapped.
"I find myself in hell," she said. "Every day I wake up to another day of war. A war for the life of my children."
Netanyahu has so far not accepted personal responsibility for the failures that allowed the surprise assault which saw hundreds of Hamas fighters storm into southern Israel on October 7, killing more than 1,400 people and taking at least 240 captive.
The war Israel has since launched on Gaza has   more than 9,400 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and reduced large areas of the besieged enclave to rubble.
Public anger in Israel has been growing, with many families of the captives held in Gaza bitterly critical of the government's response and calling for their relatives to be brought home.
Even before the war, Netanyahu had been a divisive figure, fighting  , which he denies, and pushing through a plan to curb the powers of the judiciary that brought hundreds of thousands to the streets to protest.
On Saturday, a poll for Israel's Channel 13 Television found 76 percent of Israelis thought Netanyahu, now serving a record sixth term as prime minister, should resign and 64 percent said the country should hold an election immediately after the war.
When asked who is most at fault for the attack, 44 percent of Israelis blamed Netanyahu, while 33 percent blamed the military chief of staff and senior Israeli Defence Force officials and 5 percent blamed the defence minister, according to the poll.
Calls for 'humanitarian pauses', ceasefire
On Saturday, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the US is calling for '  ' in Gaza, during a press conference in Amman with his counterparts from Jordan and Egypt.
But the Jordanian and Egyptian ministers  , instead reiterating the need for an immediate ceasefire - echoing calls from other Arab leaders.
The armed wing of Hamas said on Saturday that more than 60   are missing because of Israeli air raids on Gaza.
Abu Obeida, a spokesman for the Qassam Brigades, also said on Hamas's Telegram account that 23 bodies of Israeli captives were trapped under the rubble.
'It seems that we will never be able to reach them due to the continued brutal aggression of the occupation against Gaza,' he said.

US, UK, Germany tell citizens to leave Lebanon as regional tensions rise

The governments of the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany have advised their citizens to leave  , amid growing concerns that the Israeli assault on the beseiged Gaza Strip could trigger a wider conflict in the region.
The three nations issued advisories on Thursday, as Israeli forces continued to   with armed groups in southern Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah group is the dominant force.
"We recommend that US citizens in Lebanon make appropriate arrangements to leave the country; commercial options currently remain available," a statement from the US Embassy in Beirut said.
Separately, the US Department of State issued a global alert warning its citizens that tensions in the Middle East could increase the potential for violent attacks against Americans.
The move comes as Israel prepares for an anticipated   of Gaza, and rising fears that a ground incursion would heighten the risk of a wider regional war.
Iran and some groups that it backs throughout the region, including the formidable   in Lebanon, have suggested that they may not sit on the sidelines if fighting between Hamas and Israel continues to spiral.
An explosion at a hospital in Gaza on Tuesday, for which Israel and the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) have traded blame, sparked a   in cities across the region against Israel's continuing bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
Israel launched its campaign of air raids on October 7 after Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people, according to Israeli officials. More than 3,700 people have been killed in the Israeli assault on Gaza, according to Palestinian officials.
The US State Department raised its travel advisory for   to the highest level on Tuesday, and countries including France, Canada, Australia and Spain have also warned citizens against travelling there.
Analysts say the cross-border exchanges between Israel and armed groups in southern Lebanon have remained relatively contained, but Hezbollah has said it was fully ready to contribute to the conflict with Israel.
Israel's defence minister said on October 15 that Israel had no interest in waging war on its northern front, and that if Hezbollah restrained itself then Israel would also keep the situation along the border as it was.
The US has sought to deter other armed groups in the region, including groups with   in Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria, from joining Hamas to fight Israel. Washington has dispatched two aircraft carriers to the region and is preparing 2,000 military service members for potential deployment to assist Israel.

While a wider confrontation would likely be costly for any parties involved, it remains unclear if the precarious balance will hold.
The Reuters news agency reported on Thursday that Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq, which hosts US troops, had been attacked by missiles and drones. Separately, the Pentagon confirmed that a US warship shot down a series of missiles and drones over the Red Sea, saying that they were launched from Yemen. The warship was in the vicinity, but not the target of the attack, it said.
It is not immediately clear who carried out the attacks and whether they are related to the fighting in Israel-Palestine.

'Extremely challenging': Israel's Gaza ground assault faces stumbles

November 4th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A week after it sent ground forces into Gaza, Israel said its military had surrounded Gaza City in the north of the territory, killed 10 Hamas commanders who helped plan the October 7 attacks on Israel, and scored 'impressive successes' according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Israeli forces appeared to be in the process of cutting the Gaza Strip in two, south of Gaza City. By Friday, they had advanced  about 15km (9.3 miles) from the Gaza-Israel border along the coastal road, adjacent to the Turkey-Palestine Friendship Hospital, well south of Gaza City. The hospital is Gaza's only cancer treatment facility and has been   because of fuel shortages resulting from Israel's siege on the enclave.
Meanwhile, Hamas  said it was fighting Israeli armour east of that point, at Juhor ad-Dik, suggesting that Israeli forces were operating almost across the breadth of the Gaza strip, from the coast to the border.
Battles continued to the rear of this advanced position. Hamas-affiliated sources  said fighting was ongoing at Beit Hanoun, in the northeastern corner of the Gaza strip.
The Israeli strategy this past week seemed to be one of isolating and wearing down Hamas and its affiliates in the northern third of the Gaza Strip. But it has come at an increasing humanitarian cost to Gaza and a reputational price for Israel.
Israel claimed the Jabalia refugee camp north of Gaza City was a hub of Hamas's tunnel network used for weapons stockpiles, rocket firing positions, and tunnels leading to the coast. Israel, without providing clear evidence to back its claims, flattened large parts of Jabalia in air raids over three days. At least 50 Palestinians were   of Jabalia.
Since the Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 that killed more than 1,400 people,Israel's aerial bombardment of Gaza, now accompanied by the ground assault, has killed more than 9,400 Palestinians, including nearly 4,000 children. On Friday, an ambulance convoy headed from Gaza City to the south of Gaza was bombed — again, Israel claimed, without providing evidence, that Hamas fighters were in the ambulances. At least  .
Still, Israel has not eliminated Hamas's ability to launch rockets targeting military installations in Israel at a rate of about a dozen a day throughout the week, though this slowed to nine rocket attacks on November 3. Official figures released by the Israeli government and the health ministry in Gaza suggest most of the fatalities on both sides have been civilian.
Israel said 25 of its soldiers had been killed since the ground invasion began, bringing total military deaths to 332 . Another 260 soldiers have been injured. Israel has said Hamas is also holding 242 civilians hostage.
'A new kind of hybrid warfare'
On October 25, Netanyahu declared that Israel's aim in the coming days would be 'to eliminate Hamas by destroying its military and governance capabilities and to do everything possible to get our hostages back'.
The Israeli military tested Hamas's reflexes with a limited incursion into northern Gaza the following night with a single armoured company using bulldozers. The company 'located and attacked many terrorists, destroyed terrorist infrastructures, anti-tank positions,' said the Israeli military.
Israeli forces conducted several more ground incursions into Gaza on the night of October 27, this time supported by helicopter gunships. Israeli naval forces also 'destroyed terrorist infrastructures and operated in a compound used by [Hamas'] naval commando forces,' on the beach at Rafah, in southern Gaza, the Israeli army said.
Then, on October 28, Israel launched its ground invasion, exactly three weeks after the Hamas attack on southern Israel. The invasion was accompanied by a telecommunications blackout, cutting internet and telephone access to, from and within the Gaza Strip.
Experts have told Al Jazeera that both the Hamas attack and the Israeli response mark a departure from past confrontations between them in scale and complexity.
'What we have seen since October 7 is a new kind of hybrid warfare,' said Matteo Bressan, strategic studies professor at Lumsa Master School-University.
'Hamas was able to launch 6,000 rockets into Israel and that number shows a military capability Hamas never had in the past,' Bressan said. 'The question is how it has been possible that Hamas has conducted 20 attacks in 20 different villages. This means Hamas had clear training and preparation to do that,'
The Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said they targeted rockets at the Israeli nuclear reactor and research facility at Dimona - the first time they have ever done so.
'That's why Israel's response is different from the past … it is not simple, it is not easy, and it will take time for Israel,' Bressan said.
'Hamas has been preparing for this campaign for quite a while and predeployed many of the rockets being fired,' US special forces commander Demetries Andrew Grimes told Al Jazeera. 'Many of the Hamas rocket batteries are buried underground or deployed via the tunnel networks below Gaza.'
He described the Israeli goal of destroying Hamas as an 'extremely challenging endeavour'.
Hamas has said it has destroyed several Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles. For instance, on November 1, Hamas claimed it had destroyed at least four Israeli Merkava tanks using Yasin-105 anti-tank weapons during clashes in Beit Hanoun. Those claims had not been independently verified.
Hamas had also been daring in its tactics. On October 29, for instance, the  , Hamas's military wing, said they used tunnels to land fighters behind Israelis manning the Beit Hanoun crossing, called Erez by Israel, between Israel and northern Gaza.
'The resistance fighters penetrated the border and fired anti-armour missiles at Israeli vehicles and killed a number of occupation soldiers,' they said.
Grimes considered Israel's military fatalities 'a high casualty count considering they are only a few weeks into the campaign.'
The daring and effectiveness of the Qassam Brigades prompted the chief of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed group in Lebanon, to declare Israel weak.
'It has exposed the frailty, weakness and total fragility of Israel, more frail than a spider's web,' said   in a televised address on November 3.
'The swift response by the US to support and back Israel has revealed how failing Israel is since the Al-Aqsa Flood operation,' he said, using the operational name of the October 7 attacks.
Nasrallah said this war would mark a new era.
'It is not an event like those of the past. It is a decisive battle, a historic one. What happens after this battle is never like before,' he said.
Putting a strain on friendship
Throughout the week there were signs that Israel had felt stung by international criticism of its prosecution of the war and was trying to improve its image.
Netanyahu initially resisted pressure from the European Union and United Nations for a ceasefire for humanitarian reasons, saying Hamas could use it to regroup. That position softened a little by November 3, a day after US President Joe Biden supported calls for a humanitarian pause in the fighting. Now, Israel has conditioned any pause in fighting on the release of Hamas-held captives. "Israel refuses a temporary ceasefire which does not include the release of our hostages," Netanyahu said in a televised statement.
Netanyahu also modified his position on the amount of aid reaching Gaza. He initially allowed only a handful of trucks into the territory bringing food, water and medicine. By October 31, he agreed to allow 100 trucks a day, but even that, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, was not enough.
On Thursday, Israel for the first time allowed Palestinians with foreign or dual nationality to leave for Egypt via the   crossing at the southern end of Gaza, along with about 80 wounded Palestinians.

How deadly is the Israel-Gaza war for journalists?

November 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
At least 39 journalists have been killed in just over one month of Israel's war on Gaza – that's more than double the number of fatalities in one and a half years of Russia-Ukraine war – in what has been described as 'the deadliest month for journalists'.
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says 39 journalists, 34 of them Palestinians, have been killed since the latest conflict erupted on October 7. At least four Israelis and a Lebanese journalist are among those who have lost their lives in the war. The Paris-based press freedom watchdog, Reporters Without Borders (RSF), has put the death toll at 41.
Israel has also been accused of violating laws of war due to its indiscriminate bombardment of the Gaza Strip, killing more than 10,500 Palestinians, overwhelmingly civilians. The Hamas attack inside Israel on October 7 killed more than 1,400 people.
How do journalist fatalities in the Israel-Gaza war compare with other conflicts?
The Israel-Hamas war has seen more journalists killed in the first month of conflict than any other conflict since the CPJ first started collating statistics for journalists covering conflict in 1992.
Christophe Deloire, RSF's secretary-general, has described the toll as "shocking", with the number likely to rise as the media watchdog continues to investigate reports of several other journalists either injured or missing.
In the war between Russia and Ukraine, 17 journalists in total have been killed since the war began in 2022, the last reported killing being of French cameraman Frederic Leclerc-Imhoff who was killed in May.
The US-led invasion of Iraq sparked a war that was particularly deadly for journalists – and set a trend that has continued. According to the CPJ, 283 journalists have been killed in Iraq since 2003. That includes 11 who were killed in the first month of the war, between March and April 2003.
The war in Syria had zero journalist causalities in its first month of conflict in 2011, although the toll there has since increased dramatically to between   and 715, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights.
By comparison,63 journalists were killed in the Vietnam War that lasted two decades, and a total of 69 killed in World War II (1939-45) – the bloodiest war the modern world has seen.
Are journalists meant to be protected in war zones?
Yes. Intentionally targeting journalists, and civilians, is considered a war crime under international humanitarian law. Journalists are meant to be allowed to have the freedom and protection to perform their work without undue interference.
But in the first weeks of the war, the Israeli army issued a statement to international news agencies, stating it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists operating in the Gaza Strip.
"With their arbitrary air strikes, the Israeli armed forces are eliminating journalists one after the other without restraint, all while their unacceptable comments betray an open contempt for international humanitarian law," Jonathan Dagher, the head of RSF's Middle East desk, said in a statement.

RSF has reported that 10 journalists in the Gaza Strip were killed while working, and the CPJ has said 48 media facilities in Gaza have been hit or destroyed. At least 10 others were killed in their homes with their families. RSF is investigating whether they were deliberately targeted because of their work. Al Jazeera could not gather details about the circumstances under which other journalists were killed.
RSF   to the International Criminal Court (ICC) on October 31 alleging Israel had perpetrated war crimes against journalists in Gaza.
'This rate of attrition among media workers has deeply shocked journalists the world over. No one can watch the growing tally of fallen colleagues without mounting horror," said the secretary-general for the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), Anthony Bellanger, in a statement on November 2.
Israel has previously been accused of "  " journalists after it   housing Al Jazeera and Associated Press offices in 2021.
How many journalists and their families have been killed?
Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief   tragically lost four members of his own family in Israeli air strikes. 'They take revenge on us through our children,' he stated upon finding his son's lifeless body.
His wife Amna, 15-year-old son Mahmoud and seven-year-old daughter Sham were killed, as was his 18-month-old grandson Adam following directives to leave northern Gaza for the south, only to come under Israel's bombardment of the Nuseirat refuge camp where they were staying.
'What happened is clear. This is a series of targeted attacks on children, women and civilians. I was just reporting from Yarmouk about such an attack, and the Israeli raids have targeted many areas, including Nuseirat.
'We had our doubts that the Israeli occupation would not let these people go without punishing them. And sadly, that is what happened. This is the 'safe' area that the occupation army spoke of,' Dahdouh said.
Mohamed Abu Hasira, a journalist for the Palestinian Authority-run news agency Wafa, was killed in an air strike on his home in Gaza along with 42 family members; and Mohamed Al Jaja, a consultant at Press-House Palestine, was killed in an air strike on his home along with his wife and two daughters in the Nasr neighbourhood in northern Gaza.
Al Jazeera's Gaza correspondent Youmna ElSayed said it was a 'shock that we, journalists, who report to the world what's happening around us, have to report the story of our colleagues or of our own families'.
Two years ago, she along with others was given   to vacate al-Jalaa tower before Israel brought the building to the ground saying the building contained Hamas military assets. Israel never provided proof of its allegation. The building housed residential apartments and the offices of Al Jazeera and the Associated Press.
Sherif Mansour, CPJ's Middle East and North Africa program coordinator, said: "Those in Gaza, in particular, have paid, and continue to pay, an unprecedented toll and face exponential threats. Many have lost colleagues, families, and media facilities, and have fled seeking safety when there is no safe haven or exit.'
How were the Israeli and Lebanese journalists killed?
At least four Israeli journalists were also killed during the October 7 Hamas attack in southern Israel.
CPJ said Shai Regev, editor for TMI and Ayelet Arnin from the Israel Broadcasting Corporation Kan were among the hundreds of other victims. Two more were killed in the kibbutz located just outside of Gaza. RSF said Roee Idan, a reporter for the Israeli newspaper YNet, was killed along with his family at the Kfar Aza kibbutz close to the fence with Gaza.
Yaniv Zohar, an Israeli photographer working for the Hebrew-language daily newspaper Israel Hayom, was killed during a Hamas attack on the Nahal Oz kibbutz along with his wife and two daughters.
Issam Abdallah, a Reuters journalist in Lebanon, was killed on October 13 by a missile strike from Israel.
What are journalism bodies saying?
Periods of communication blackouts have made it harder for journalists to document and report the situation in Gaza. RSF has called for "foreign journalists to be allowed to enter the territory, so they can work freely".
Israel has threatened journalists and often dubbed local journalists to be supporters of Hamas. It only allowed foreign journalists this week in Gaza embedded with the Israeli military.
The International Federation for Journalists (IFJ) has issued a call, signed by 80 journalist groups, for Israeli authorities to take full responsibility for protecting journalists covering the conflict. "We demand an explicit commitment from the Israelis that their armed forces will take every effort to ensure that the grim tally of journalists who have died in this conflict rises no further. This is simply unacceptable, and the Israeli government will have to accept its responsibilities."

Israeli authorities have said that a 23-year-old German-Israeli woman named Shani Louk, abducted by the Palestinian armed group Hamas during   on southern Israel, is dead.
The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a social media post on Monday that it had confirmed the death of Louk, snatched at a   where Hamas fighters killed more than 200 people.
'Our hearts are broken,' the social media post reads, adding that Louk had been 'paraded' around Gaza.
'May her memory be a blessing.'
The circumstances of Louk's death were not immediately clear.
Louk's sister Adi spoke of her "great sorrow" as she shared the news of Shani's death on Instagram.
Speaking with the German outlet RTL/nt-v, Shani's mother Ricarda Louk said that the body of her daughter had not been found, but a piece of her skull with matching DNA had been recovered.
Ricarda said that she believes her daughter has been dead since the assault on October 7, in which Hamas killed more than 1,400 people. The mother said that she believes her daughter was possibly shot in the head.
"At least she didn't suffer," she told RTL/n-tv.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the news of Louk's death was "terrible" and showed the need to hold Hamas to account.
There was no immediate comment from Hamas.
The October 7 attack saw hundreds of Hamas fighters break through the Israeli security barrier around the besieged Gaza Strip and enter a series of towns  , killing entire families, including women and children.
"What we saw on the Gaza-Israel border goes far beyond a pogrom. We saw a slaughterhouse," Israeli President Isaac Herzog told Germany's Bild newspaper in an interview in which he confirmed Louk's death.
More than 220 people, including Israelis and foreigners, were also   in the attack.
Since the attack, Israel has carried out a devastating campaign of air raids on Gaza, which it has placed under total siege, cutting off access to water, electricity, food and fuel.
Family members of those held captive have pleaded for   and human rights groups and the United Nations have also called for the immediate release of the hostages.
On Monday, Hamas released footage that purports to show three captive women delivering a brief statement in which they blame Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the October 7 attack and call for a   to secure their release.
"She [one of the captives] blamed him [Netanyahu] for the failure of the October 7 attack, from preventing it from happening, for saying that no army was present, no one came to help us," said Al Jazeera correspondent Sara Khairat.
Statements offered by people being held captive are often given under duress. Netanyahu denounced the video as "cruel psychological propaganda" in a response on Monday.

Gaza medics say Israel targeting ambulances, health facilities

Talal Taha and his team at the al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza City's largest, received an emergency call on Saturday evening and leaped into action. Earlier that day, Israel had   following a stunning attack by armed Palestinian group Hamas on Israeli territory.
Three vehicles headed to a location in the vicinity of the city's eastern cemetery. The team followed the sound of cries for help as the city was enveloped in darkness.
'All of a sudden we were targeted [by an air attack] and we ran for safety,' Taha, a paramedic, told Al Jazeera. The emergency team jumped into their cars on Salah al-Din Road and the vehicles proceeded a few metres before another air strike hit.
Three of his colleagues were killed and Taha was lightly injured. 'Our mission is humanitarian, we provide humanitarian service only, and we were targeted without any reason, without any excuse,' he said.
It was no one-off incident. Health authorities and medical organisations in the Gaza Strip have accused Israel of deliberately bombing ambulances and health facilities in the besieged enclave, in breach of international rules that catalogue such attacks as war crimes.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) on Wednesday condemned 'the intentional targeting of medical teams', which killed 'four paramedics in less than half an hour today, despite prior coordination'.
'Targeting medical personnel is a grave breach to international humanitarian law and to humanity,' the organisation said in a statement on Wednesday. 'PRCS demands accountability for this war crime, urging immediate investigation and justice for the victims.'
The health ministry in Gaza also denounced what it called 'direct and systematic attacks on ambulances'.
'Targeting ambulances blatantly contradicts international laws and treaties that protect health facilities and services in places affected by armed conflicts,' it said on Tuesday.

At least 1,200 people have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of hostilities on Saturday, including hundreds of children and women, and more than 5,600 citizens have been wounded, the health ministry said.
Fifteen ambulances and nine health institutions have been hit, including the Ministry of Health building, the Rimal Clinic and the International Eye Center, it said.
Doctors Without Borders, (Medecins sans Frontieres, also known by its acronym MSF), said it had counted 16 medical personnel killed since Saturday, 18 ambulances destroyed and eight medical facilities damaged either totally or partially.
Sohaib Safi, medical coordinator for MSF in Gaza, said the scale of the damage was 'very clear evidence' that medical aid in the enclave was being intentionally attacked by Israeli forces.
'When ambulances are trying to reach areas under fire, they are targeted as a message that no one should get inside to evacuate injured or stuck people,' Safi told Al Jazeera. As a result, taxis and private cars had increasingly been taking up the task of transferring the wounded to hospitals to avoid attracting attention.
Israel has been insisting that it warns civilians to evacuate buildings before striking them, through on the ground, many Palestinians have been hit without any warning. And Israel has made clear that it laying the stage for a ground invasion.
Israeli army spokesperson Jonathan Conricus on Wednesday said the Israeli military's mission was 'to make sure that Hamas, at the end of this war, won't have any military capabilities by which they can threaten or kill Israeli civilians'.
Dwindling resources
At al-Shifa Hospital, it is not just patients and their families seeking help. Frightened Gaza City residents, too, have found shelter at the hospital, in the hope that it will not be attacked.
But already, the neonatal unit has been partly damaged due to bombardments around the facility, according to medical personnel.
Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a surgeon at al-Shifa Hospital, said the situation on Wednesday continued to deteriorate. 'A number of patients, especially kids, are coming in with horrendous injuries,' he said.
'This morning we had a beautiful young girl with really indescribable facial injuries, whose mother is a doctor at al-Shifa and was killed when their home was targeted.'
Abu-Sittah added that the hospitals were full and were starting to run low on supplies. 'And it's only day four,' he said.
MSF's Safi said the organisation had already used half of its emergency provisions, which it schedules to last two months in times of crisis.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Monday announced a full blockade of Gaza, including a ban on the admission of food, electricity and fuel into the territory.
Hospitals have had no access to the electrical grid and depend on fuel to power their generators. At al-Shifa Hospital, medical personnel estimated fuel supplies could last three to four days at most.
The acute shortage of medicines to cater to an ever-growing number of patients is already having severe repercussions on some of the most vulnerable patients. The Ministry of Health estimated that 9,000 patients in Gaza suffer from cancer and are in need of treatment.
Blood for transfusions, essential medicines, medical equipment and desalinated water are also needed across the Gaza Strip, medics said.
Mahmoud Shalabi, senior programme manager for the United Kingdom-based organisation Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) in Gaza, expressed concern for the prospect of a tightening blockade and a potential ground invasion.
'I hope not,' he told Al Jazeera. 'Because [if so], this is going to be the worst humanitarian catastrophe that Palestinians have seen since 1948.'

Thousands of patients and displaced people at al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City remain in fear after Israel ordered an "   of the area on Sunday.
Palestinians on Sunday stormed the United Nations warehouses and distribution centres for basic necessities such as wheat flour after three weeks of total siege and relentless bombardments.
Hamas said it would return all Israeli captives in exchange for all Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant doubted that Hamas would follow through.
Israel said early on Monday that its fighter jets   in Syria and Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. They claimed it was in response to earlier rocket launches into the Israeli territory.
Human impact and fighting
More than 8,000 people, including some 3,000 children, have been killed in Gaza since October 7. Save the Children   that the number of children in Gaza killed since October 7 has exceeded the number of children killed in conflicts around the world annually since 2019.
Overnight Israeli air raids have killed more than 30 people and caused 'significant damage' to Turkish Hospital in southwest Gaza. Early on Sunday, Gaza's largest al-Shifa hospital was also hit by air raids, according to The Associated Press news agency.
Internet connectivity is gradually being restored in Gaza after a   swept the enclave on Friday. Israeli air raids targeted communication nodes, prompting people around the world to push for alternate sources of internet. Elon Musk said his company   internet connectivity to "internationally recognized aid organizations in Gaza" while Vodafone Egypt said it would send mobile units to the Rafah border, according to Egypt Independent. A senior American official told The Washington Post that the United States pressured Israel to restore communications.
A Reporters Without Borders (RSF)   found that "it is unlikely" that the journalists killed at the Israel-Lebanon border were mistaken for fighters.

No privacy, no water: Gaza women use period-delaying pills amid war

October 31st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Gaza Strip – Many Palestinian women have resorted to taking menstruation-delaying pills due to the desperate, unsanitary circumstances they have been forced into as a result of the continuing Israeli offensive in Gaza.
Facing displacement, overcrowded living conditions, and a lack of access to water and menstrual hygiene products such as sanitary napkins and tampons, women have been taking norethisterone tablets – ordinarily prescribed for conditions such as severe menstrual bleeding, endometriosis, and painful periods – to avoid the discomfort and pain of menstruation.
According to Dr Walid Abu Hatab, an obstetrics and gynaecology medical consultant at the Nasser Medical Complex in the southern city of Khan Younis, the tablets keep progesterone hormone levels raised to stop the uterus from shedding its lining, thus delaying a period.
The pills may have side effects such as include irregular vaginal bleeding, nausea, changes to the menstrual cycle, dizziness and mood swings, according to medical professionals, but some women like Salma Khaled say they have no choice but to take the risk amid Israel's relentless bombardment and blockade of Gaza.

'Most difficult days'
Salma fled her home in Gaza City's Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood two weeks ago and is staying at a relative's house in Deir el-Balah refugee camp in central Gaza. The 41-year-old says she has been in a constant state of fear, discomfort and depression, which has taken a toll on her menstrual cycle.
"I am experiencing the most difficult days of my life during this war," Salma says. "I got my period twice this month so far – which is very irregular for me – and suffered heavy bleeding."
Salma says there are not enough sanitary pads available in the few shops and pharmacies that have remained open. Meanwhile, sharing a house with dozens of relatives amid a water shortage has made regular hygiene a luxury – if not an impossibility. The use of the bathroom must be rationed, and showering is limited to once every few days.
Pharmacies and stores alike are facing dwindling supplies due to the   imposed by Israel following an attack by the armed wing of the Palestinian group   on October 7. In addition, Israel's bombardment of main roads in the Gaza Strip has made transporting products from medical warehouses to pharmacies an impossible task, according to Abu Hatab.
Without the means to manage her menstruation as she usually would, Salma decided to try to find pills to skip her period.
While sanitary napkins are in demand and hard to find, period-delaying tablets are generally more available in some pharmacies as they are not commonly used.
"I asked my daughter to go to the pharmacy and buy pills that delay menstruation," Salma says. "Perhaps this war will end soon and I will not need to use them more than once," she added, worried about the possible side effects of the pills on her body.
'Extreme stress'
More than   have been internally displaced in the Gaza Strip since October 7, living in cramped, unhygienic conditions in United Nations-run schools and in overcrowded spaces with host families or relatives, leaving no room for privacy.
The effects of the Israeli offensive – now in its 25th day – have been devastating.   have been killed, the majority of them women and children. Repeated warnings by the Israeli military for residents to leave northern Gaza and Gaza City have seen towns and cities in the centre and south of the territory swell in number, but air attacks have continued to pound the southern  Gaza Strip.
According to Nevin Adnan, a psychologist and social worker based in Gaza City, women ordinarily may experience psychological and physical symptoms in the days before and during their periods, such as changes in their mood and lower abdominal and back pain.
These symptoms can worsen during times of stress such as the ongoing war, according to Adnan. "Displacement causes extreme stress and that affects the woman's body and her hormones," she explained.
"There can also be an increase of the physical symptoms associated with menstruation, such as abdominal and back pain, constipation and bloating," she said.
Women may experience insomnia, constant nervousness and extreme tension, Adnan added.
At present, she said more women are open to taking period-delaying pills to avoid embarrassment and shame due to the lack of hygiene, privacy, and available health products.
Still, although she understands the current predicament, Adnan said in normal circumstances consulting a doctor before taking these tablets is important to know what effects these pills and their sustained use might have on a woman's physical health.
"They could affect the woman's natural hormonal changes, the date of her menstruation for the following month, the amount of blood she loses, and whether it stops the period," she told Al Jazeera.

No privacy, water or sanitary napkins
Samira al-Saadi, who is displaced with her family in a UN-run school west of Khan Younis, wishes she could do more for her 15-year-old daughter who got her first period a few months ago.
Her daughter is overwhelmed by both recently starting to menstruate and having to manage her period in a crowded shelter, the 55-year-old says. "She needs sanitary pads and water to wash, but these basic needs are not available."
Samira is concerned about buying her daughter period-delaying pills as she worries how they might affect her child's health.
"She just doesn't understand why she has to go through all of this," Samira says. "I try to help her, but what she needs is not at hand."
Ruba Seif is also staying at the shelter with her family.
"There is no privacy, the bathrooms do not have running water, and we cannot go outside easily to look for what we need," says the 35-year-old.
"I cannot bear the menstrual cramps on top of the intense fear we experience constantly, the lack of sleep, and the cold since there aren't enough blankets."
The thought of coping with her period at the shelter has been a constant source of stress for Ruba.
Ruba, who is busy taking care of her four children, the oldest being 10 and the youngest two years old, eventually asked her brother to look for period-delaying pills. After searching in several pharmacies he eventually found them.
"Other women around me in the school have asked me for these pills," Ruba says. "One of them told me that she had gone through the worst period in her life. I know of their negative side effects, but these pills cannot be more harmful than the missiles, death and destruction all around us."
Back in the Deir el-Balah refugee camp, Salma rues the psychological and physical effects of the war on women, as many are gripped not only with concerns such as menstrual health but also those of how to take care of their children who look to them as a major source of protection, reassurance, and support.
"In war, we are forced to do everything we can," she says, referring to the state of suffering. "There is never a choice."

'Now isn't the time': Israel's left conflicted on future after Hamas attack

November 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Tel Aviv, Israel – Danielle*, a soft-spoken 22-year-old, walks past a series of high-rise apartment blocks in  , a city on Israel's southern coast. The sounds of explosions in the nearby Gaza Strip echo across the nearly deserted city.
A self-described leftie, Danielle says the events of October 7, when Hamas broke out of the Gaza Strip and killed 1,400 people in surprise attacks of southern Israel, have challenged her political views.
'I think that after that Saturday, people who believed in peace do not believe in it anymore. It became personal. They [Hamas] came into the kibbutz, and they were just massacring people.'
She says many of her   have also changed their views. Before October 7, she says there was a will to understand the perspective of people in Gaza who supported Hamas but now that has gone.
"Before, I think the left really believed in peace, and we need to look at their side – they're just doing it because they are poor. But I think at the end of the day, I am paying taxes for Gaza's electricity and water, but Hamas is just taking that money and investing it in rockets instead of education."
The events of October 7 have deeply affected Israeli society. The country is embracing a wave of nationalism as the military conducts a military campaign in Gaza.
More than a month after the Hamas attacks, Israeli flags hang from almost every street lamp on Israel's motorway network, and the government espouses a near-constant stream of jingoist sabre-rattling.
This atmosphere has resulted in many people on the left, who have seen their views shift to the right, now wrestling with an internal conflict as they reflect on where they stand in an unexpected and emotionally charged period in which traditional political divisions have, at least temporarily, fallen away.
An 'emotional response' from the left
A raucous group of left-wing protesters hold up placards emblazoned with anti-government slogans on Eliezer Kaplan Street, a bustling thoroughfare in central Tel Aviv.
One contains an illustration depicting a red, bloodied handprint over the image of  .
Ohad Gur, a tall, 50-year-old engineer, tells Al Jazeera that he has not changed his views since October 7: 'I am left-wing, so I do think we need to release all the prisoners, get into negotiations right now, don't go into the Gaza Strip."

However, he acknowledges that many people on the left have shifted their views, some of which include a 'more militant' approach.
He puts this move down to an 'emotional response' at a time when a strong military operation might feel logical but is a reaction that he believes 'will pass away little by little'.
About 100 metres [110 yards] from the anti-government protest stands a row of white tarpaulin tents covered in posters containing images of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 and now being held captive in Gaza.

  mingle with members of the public who have come to show support. Messages scribbled on placards show solidarity with the families of the October 7 victims. Yellow ribbons, a symbol for those seeking the release of Israeli captives that first appeared in 2008 in support of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was captured and taken to the Gaza Strip by Hamas in 2006, are handed out to passers-by.
Talia Keinan, a 45-year-old artist, and Gai Sherf, a 46-year-old musician, sit on plastic chairs in the shade, having come to mourn the death of their mutual friend's parents who died on October 7. Their friend's brother was taken to Gaza, but they have not received information about whether he is dead or alive.
Talia says many of her friends who were left wing have become more "patriotic" since October 7. She says it is an emotional response, also driven by fear, when people feel the need 'to defend themselves'.
It's a shift that concerns her.
'There is a thin border between defending yourself and revenge, and I cannot count on this government knowing this border because revenge will lead to another revenge.'
Gai says although it is a traumatic period for Israelis, he doesn't want to get caught up in the nationalistic fervour. 'As I see it, there was something very extreme and shocking and painful and hurtful done by those people of Hamas. Then the question is, how do we respond to it?' Taking a long pause, he continues: "My response is I want to act differently, not to get into this vicious circle they invite me [into]."
In a trendy, cavernous cafe in occupied East Jerusalem, Dennis* tells Al Jazeera that he has seen many people traditionally on the far left who have recently said things that appear out of character but he chooses to ignore them because he believes they are driven by 'rage' and 'emotion' after the Hamas attacks.
He says although he has also been deeply affected by October 7 and wishes 'Hamas would disappear from the earth', he does not support a 'massive military army operation in Gaza'. It is a view that he says could make him the target of right-wingers, so instead, he chooses to 'focus less on politics and more on escapism'.

Nadav Hakham, a 27-year-old consultant who says his political views are more right of centre and spoke to Al Jazeera over the phone, says there is a feeling in Israel that there is "an existential threat'. He says this mood has caused the political spectrum to unify around common defence goals – at least temporarily.
He says he had many friends from the "deep left" with whom he had many arguments before who were deeply shocked by the events of October 7 but feel "the progressive world" is now "betraying them' by criticising Israel's response.
Now, he says, they are 'very much involved in pro-Israeli events'.
At a Palestinian-Israeli solidarity event in Baka el-Garbiya in northern Israel, Aldema, a slight, quick-witted photographer in his 30s, looks on as attendees call for a peaceful settlement to the war.
It's a sentiment he says he shares to some extent, but he says the events of October 7 have left many like him who live in kibbutzim conflicted.
When Hamas attacked southern Israel, its fighters swarmed several kibbutzim near the Gaza Strip, killing and kidnapping members of the communal settlements.
It has left deep emotional trauma within the larger kibbutz community, whose members largely vote for left-wing parties.
There is an additional frustration, he says, that many within the community were sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, including himself.
"Hamas did not kill settlers. … All the communities who got slaughtered were mostly pro-Palestinian," he says.
Now, although he still wants peace, he says the left needs to be more "realistic" regarding the need for some form of military response.
Too early to know 'where Israeli progressives will land'
It's unclear just how permanently October 7 will alter Israeli left-wing politics and, in particular, party politics, activists and political leaders say.
'It's all super emotionally charged and not yet processed in people's minds to draw conclusions,' says Roee Aloni, director of public outreach at B'tselem, an Israeli human rights group. This, he says, makes it too early to determine 'where Israeli progressives will land'.
However, he says that often during periods of conflict, many leftists veer to the right, and in the current period, he says, 'some are really expressing extreme right sentiments'.
Ofer Cassif, a member of the Knesset and a leader of the leftist Hadash coalition, says there is "confusion" among many leftists who previously opposed occupation but now feel the "very existence of the state of Israel" is under threat.
Others, he says, feel "disappointed by the international left", which they perceive as guilty of hypocrisy in not condemning Hamas for its attacks on Israel.
Members of the Knesset feel that in the short-term, politics in Israel are so heated that those who even show "sympathy for the children of Gaza" are facing persecution, Ofer says. In October, he was suspended from the Knesset for 45 days after he accused the Netanyahu government of using the October 7 attacks to engineer a "final solution" in Gaza with the elimination of Palestinians in the enclave the goal.
Yet, in the long run, opposition among the left to occupation "will and must revitalise", he says.

That won't be easy.
'As always everywhere, extremism feeds extremism. And a dichotomy of us against them divides along nationalistic lines instead of ideological and shared values,' Roee says.
'Add to that the fact that we have a government that is set on purposefully radicalising the Israel public and inciting it against Palestinians.'
'Now is not the time'
For many, it is simply a time to put political wrangling on hold.
A small stretch of pavement separates the two protests in central Tel Aviv, the idea being that criticism of the government is kept separate from the families who are undergoing the emotional turmoil of losing their loved ones.
However, sometimes, the two mix as people express frustration with Netanyahu and his cabinet over his handling of the situation with the Israeli captives.
At one point, a woman pulls down a poster and furiously tears off a part that contains an anti-government message and stuffs it into a rubbish bin. She then places the remainder of the poster with an image of a captive on the wall beside her.
An impassioned argument erupts nearby. A man with an open floral shirt pleads with a protester, using a nickname for Netanyahu: 'Why are you connecting responsibility with Bibi? Just focus on the victims. The families of those kidnapped don't want politics. No left or right. This is not the place.'

Rey Kanterewicz, a 39-year-old who works in tourism, has come to show solidarity with the captives' families. He agrees that it is important in the current war to put aside political gripes.
'You know we have so many political problems in this small country, but now, everyone understands … it is not the right time.' Instead, he says, people should be focused on supporting the efforts to get the captives out of Gaza.
At the anti-Netanyahu protest, Gideon Avaltal Eppstein, a straight-talking historian and veteran of the 1973 October War, known as the Yom Kippur War in Israel, shouts into a megaphone at passing traffic, 'Bibi is destroying us!'
A delivery man on a moped pulls up beside him and says, 'I am with you, but now is not the time.'
It is something Gideon says he hears often. 'A lot of people say to us, 'Now is not the time.' People throw eggs and tomatoes at us.'
Despite this, he stands every day to protest against not just the government but also against its decision to launch a military operation in Gaza. He says he does not agree with the plan to 're-conquer the Gaza Strip'.
'Thousands of civilians and Israeli soldiers will be killed.'

Analysis: The foreign factors in Israel's war on Gaza

October 30th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel continued its ground action inside the Gaza Strip on Sunday, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called 'the second phase'.
Semantics aside, the not-quite-big and not-quite-rapid move that has been going on for three days is a step up from the previous two quick in-and-out night-time incursions. But not an all-out invasion.
Soldiers call this reconnaissance-in-force. In preparation for an offensive, smaller units attack to probe the positions, strength, tactics and operational readiness of their foes. Initial battle plans are then adapted using the knowledge obtained.
Even so, Israel's ground advance looks timid: it is smaller and slower than the big push the ministers and generals boasted about.
Some pundits may see it as a sign that the Israeli army lacks sufficient weapons reserves. But that cannot be, because it is continuing relentless aerial bombing and long-distance shelling of Gaza that has not abated for more than three weeks now, causing massive indiscriminate casualties.
Hamas casualties are unknown, but it is likely that the ratio of those killed in Gaza is hundreds of Palestinian civilians for each Hamas fighter killed.
Israel's sluggish advance may be deliberate, to allow for diplomacy, secret talks and clandestine deals. Its neighbours – Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria – do not want the conflict to escalate and are taking care not to fuel it in any way. Qatar is leading diplomatic efforts for the release of captives held by Hamas and to avoid further escalation.
The position of two big regional powers with strong armies, Turkey and Iran, is quite peculiar.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sharply criticised Israel on Saturday, calling it an occupier in his address to a massive rally in support of Palestine a day ahead of the 100th anniversary of the Turkish republic.
Turkey's criticism of Israel is almost certain to remain political, but Iran's position is more complex, and what it might do remains an enigma.
Iran is a sworn enemy of Israel. It set up, trained, organised, armed and continues to support a series of sub-state armed groups in the region. The biggest and best-known among them is Lebanon-based Hezbollah, but Iran has also been present through proxies in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, lands where bloody conflicts were or are being fought.
The big question is whether Iran will – directly – join a war over Gaza.
Analysis suggests that Tehran would lose more than it would gain by getting involved in a major war. There are only two ways in which Iran could take the fight to Israel: overland and ballistically.
Overland, it would have to cross through Iraq and Syria. Both are Iranian allies but neither would willingly allow the use of its territory, even if the move was militarily plausible. The United States, which still maintains a security presence and has interests in Iraq, would be less than happy. The government in Damascus, which controls the areas Iran would need to go through, knows that even a temporary presence of the Iranian army could easily reignite the Syrian conflict.
Such an adventurous march through the deserts is not militarily plausible – it would mean crossing 1,000km (620 miles) from Iran to Israel, under the skies in which the US and its allies have unquestioned aerial supremacy.
Iran's other option could be to launch its formidable long-range ballistic arsenal against Israel, whose Iron Dome is already struggling to counter crude but deadly Hamas missiles.
But Tehran's generals have for decades been trying to predict possible responses to their use of missiles – and apparently, they concluded most would be unfavourable for Iran.
If any among Tehran decision-makers thought that their missiles could somehow overwhelm their enemies' defences, they were cruelly brought to reality on October 19, when a US Navy destroyer deployed in the Red Sea intercepted and shot down no less than four cruise missiles launched against Israel from Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi fighters. The USS Carney also downed 14 drones. It is not known if the Houthis independently decided to take on Israel, or if Tehran had a say in it, but the fate of those missiles was a message to both.
The US Navy demonstrated a 100 percent success rate against missiles en route; in Israel, the Iron Dome is believed to consistently intercept more than 90 percent of incoming projectiles. Faced with that, it would make military sense for Iran to pass on the missile war.
So how will the situation develop? As hard and risky as it is to make such a bold claim, I think the US has reason to believe that no state actor will join in the fighting in Gaza. Unless there is a major escalation of force or a move for total expulsion of the Palestinians from the Strip.
The current, geographically limited 'war' should thus not turn into a wider regional conflagration, a message that will have been made clear to all countries through diplomatic channels and intermediaries who have contacts with both sides. US President Joe Biden has reiterated American support for Israel, but also made several statements asking for de-escalation and that hostage release talks be given a chance. But if there are talks, wouldn't at least some participants try to take them further?
The real reason for the unprecedented level of deployment of US forces in the region – with an aircraft carrier battle group in the Mediterranean and another in the Gulf and the strengthening of reconnaissance, surveillance and electronic intelligence assets as well as a small ground force – is to discourage any foolish moves by rogue generals or non-state armed groups like Hezbollah.
For the plan to stand a chance, every avenue towards defusing the conflict must be explored – including asking US ally Israel to slow down enough to keep face domestically, but nevertheless give time for negotiations that may secure the release of some or all hostages.
Whatever the numbers involved and the timeline, it would be an encouraging step.

Israel army says it hit Syrian 'structures' in Golan Heights

Israel's military has said its tanks fired on two Syrian structures in the Golan Heights in what the army said was a violation of a 1974 disengagement accord between the two countries.
"The strike was carried out after IDF [Israeli army] soldiers identified the two structures in the area of the security zone yesterday," the military said in a statement on Thursday.
"The IDF holds the Syrian regime responsible for all activities occurring within its territory and will not allow any attempts to violate Israeli sovereignty," it said.
The strike targeted a location on the Syrian side of the demarcation line between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to the west, and Syrian-controlled territory to the east.
The announcement from Israel's military came after at least two people were killed while riding a motorcycle near the Syrian town of Beit Jinn, about an hour north of where the tanks struck, two Palestinian sources and one Lebanese security source told the Reuters news agency.
The two Palestinian sources accused Israel of conducting a strike to target the two men, whom the sources identified as "militants".
Israel's military declined to comment on the reported motorcycle strike.
But on Thursday, The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), an opposition war monitor, had reported that an Israeli drone had killed two men belonging to the Islamic Jihad organisation in the area.
"Two members of Al-Jihad Al-Islamy Movement [Islamic Jihad] were killed in an attack by an Israeli drone on Baet Jen [Beit Jinn] area in western Rif Dimashq, near the border with the Syrian occupied Golan," the war monitor said in a statement .
The Golan Heights - a hilly 1,200 square kilometre (463 square miles) plateau that also overlooks Lebanon and borders Jordan - is Syrian territory that was occupied by Israel in 1967, after the latter captured the area in the Six Day War, before annexing it in 1981.
That unilateral annexation was not recognised internationally, except by the administration of former US president Donald Trump, and Syria demands the return of the territory.
Syria tried to regain the Heights in the 1973 Middle East war, but was thwarted. Israel and Syria signed an armistice in 1974 and the Golan had been relatively quiet since.
A United Nations force continues to patrol an 80km (50-mile) long buffer zone between the Israel-occupied Heights and the Syrian side.
In 2000, Israel and Syria held their highest-level talks over a possible return of the Golan and a peace agreement. But the negotiations collapsed and subsequent talks also failed.
More than 40,000 people live in the Israeli-occupied Golan, more than half of them Druze.
After annexing the Golan, Israel gave the Druze the option of citizenship, but most rejected it and still identify as Syrian. Approximately another 20,000 Israeli settlers also live there.
Over the past decade Israel has carried out air attacks against suspected Iranian-sponsored weapons transfers and personnel deployments in neighbouring Syria, often leading to casualties among Syrian military personnel and foreign fighters.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo urges Biden to help end Gaza 'atrocities'

November 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has pressed his United States counterpart Joe Biden to do more to end "atrocities" in Gaza and help bring about a ceasefire.
The two leaders' talks on Monday were overshadowed by the month-long Israel-Hamas war in which the US has given Israel its full support.
Widodo, who is popularly known as Jokowi, attended a joint summit of Arab and Muslim leaders in Riyadh at the weekend which condemned Israel and called for a ceasefire.
Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim country and has seen large protests in support of the Palestinians as well as a   seen as linked to Israel.
"Indonesia appeals to the US to do more to stop the atrocities in Gaza," Widodo said in the Oval Office as the two presidents met in the White House in front of a roaring fire.
"A ceasefire is a must for the sake of humanity."
Violence erupted on October 7 after the armed group Hamas, which controls Gaza, launched a surprise assault on Israel killing about 1,200 people and taking  . In response Israel imposed a   on Gaza and has been bombarding the Gaza Strip ever since, killing at least 11,000 Palestinians.

US officials have said Biden is keen for Indonesia to "play a larger role" in the Middle East, which could include the "ceasefire issue" but also long-term goals such as a two-state solution after the war and rebuilding Gaza.
While Washington has thrown its full support behind Israel, it has more recently begun calling for more restraint and "pauses" in the fighting that would allow the delivery of humanitarian aid or the release of the captives held by Hamas.
'New era of relations'
The Jokowi-Biden meeting comes ahead of talks between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as a key summit of leaders from APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation), which is taking place in San Francisco. China and Indonesia are both members of APEC.
The US aims to upgrade cooperation with Indonesia to a so-called comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest diplomatic level, as it deepens alliances in the Asia Pacific region. Biden unveiled a similar upgrade to ties with Vietnam on a visit to Hanoi in September.
"This will mark a new era of relations between the United States and Indonesia across the board, affecting everything," Biden said as he sat next to Jokowi.
The deepening crisis in Myanmar was also up for discussion. The country was plunged into turmoil in February 2021, when the military seized power from the government of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Fighting between the military and armed groups fighting against the coup has intensified in the past couple of weeks.
The US and other mainly Western countries have imposed sanctions but the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), while banning Myanmar's top generals from its summits, has had little success in  . Indonesia is the outgoing chair of the 10-member grouping that welcomed Myanmar as a member some 25 years ago with Laos next to take the helm.
"It's going to be time soon for us to think about what our next steps are together to deal with a situation that is untenable," the officials told Reuters.
Biden and Jokowi's talks also covered new cooperation in areas of defence such as cybersecurity, and space as well as climate with the US due to announce steps with the Southeast Asian country on carbon capture and storage, supporting the electricity grid and improving air quality.
Amid rising geopolitical tension, Jokowi was keen to stress Indonesia's long-held neutrality.
'Indonesia is always open to cooperate with any country, and not to take the side of any power, except to take the side of peace and humanity,' he said.

'I'll walk again': Hope for injured Palestinians crossing into Egypt

Gaza Strip — Ismail Al-Fajm is relieved that his nephew, seven-year-old Salem Sammour, is among the 81 wounded Palestinians who could   from the besieged Gaza Strip into Egypt from the Rafah crossing.
Sammour had lost his father and other family members in an air raid a little over two weeks ago. The young boy's body is riddled with shrapnel that has cut off part of his flesh, and left him writhing and screaming in pain. Meanwhile, his mother needs treatment for her own injuries.
"The medical capabilities in Gaza are limited, and the doctors weren't able to deal with the child's condition,' says the uncle as he tries to calm Sammour, while preparing him to leave Nasser Hospital in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis. "His treatment in Egypt represents hope and an opportunity for him to live.'
On Wednesday, the staff of Nasser Hospital — and families — were busy assisting 19 patients as they boarded ambulance vehicles that ushered them to the Rafah crossing.
After weeks of negotiations, Qatar finally succeeded in brokering the   of the first group of injured from Gaza into Egypt, where rows of ambulance vehicles were waiting to take them to hospitals across the Sinai Peninsula.
'I hope this is just the beginning. I do pray that all the wounded get the help they need. May this not be a one-off thing,' says Al-Fajm.
Since the Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 that left 1,400 people dead, Israel has bombarded Gaza, killing more than 8,700 people, including over 3,000 children. Israel has   or actually attacked several hospitals and medical facilities, where it accuses Hamas of hiding bases and missile facilities. More than a dozen of Gaza's hospitals are out of operation, with others struggling to function amid a   because of Israel's total blockade on the enclave.
'I'll walk again'
Pushed onto a wheelchair not far from Sammour, 10-year-old Aseel Al-Astal smiles, then winces in pain, only to smile again. She has lost more than 15 of her relatives in Israeli bombing, and has multiple fractures herself. Her face is covered with cuts. As she is helped aboard an ambulance that will take her to Rafah, she raises her fingers to signal victory, and speaks with joy about the possibility of being healed.
'I am very happy because I can be treated and be able to walk again,' she says. Pointing to the splint that covers most of her right foot, she says, 'I can return to Gaza without this and play with all my friends like I did before the war.'
She teases the paramedics and a few relatives who came to bid her farewell and raise her morale. She pretends to leap from the wheelchair and into the ambulance on her own.
According to her cousin, who will be accompanying Al-Astal on her trip and asked not to be named, the girl had undergone some medical procedures in the hospital, but doctors were unable to deal fully with her health condition, prompting them to include her in the list of the wounded who need treatment outside Gaza.
Praying for her relative's recovery, Al-Astal's cousin wishes that others who were injured also get a chance for a full recovery. 'I know many of them, and they're happy for those selected among this first batch. But they're also all hopeful they'd be among the next to leave,' she says.
'Rescue them before they, too, die'
The director of Nasser Hospital, Dr Nahed Abu Taaema, says that many of the remaining wounded are in desperate need of treatment. 'There have been several cases of deaths among those critically injured as they awaited this chance to travel abroad for treatment. If the opportunity for the next batch to leave drags on, many others won't make it,' he tells Al Jazeera.
Abu Taaema explains that a committee of doctors, consultants and heads of departments had put together the list of those to be prioritised for receiving treatment in Egypt, with precedence given to children and women, especially those who are suffering from injuries to the head, backbone, chest and others.
'But due to the severe shortage of supplies, and the seriousness of many other cases, there are many more who did not make it on that list that also need immediate and specific attention,' he says. 'They too need to be rescued before they too, die, or deteriorate.'

Tens of thousands join rally for Israel in Washington, DC

November 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Tens of thousands of people have joined a rally in Washington, DC, to voice solidarity with Israel in its fight against Hamas and condemn anti-Semitism.
Tuesday's "March for Israel" took place on the National Mall under heavy security, with senior members of Congress addressing a crowd of people waving the flags of the United States and Israel.
Many raised placards calling on the Palestinian armed group Hamas to free the at least 200 people taken captive during their surprise October 7 attack, which Israeli authorities say killed more than 1,200 people.
Israel's response - weeks of   on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, which officials there say have killed more than 11,300 people - has exposed deep divisions in the US, Israel's most staunch supporter.
At the top of the mall, the top Democrats in Congress - Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jefferies - stood together on stage with Republicans Mike Johnson, the House of Representatives speaker, and Senator Joni Ernst from the central state of Iowa. They joined hands as Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the US, chanted, 'We stand with Israel.'

But beneath the projection of unity, Democrats and the US itself are sharply divided over Israel's course and its treatment of Palestinians.
The country has seen weeks of largely   amid growing calls for a ceasefire and President Joe Biden has toned down some of the full-throated solidarity with the Israelis from the war's early weeks to urge more restraint.
Hamas a target
A succession of speakers took the stage to condemn the Hamas attack and what they said was the virulent spread of anti-Semitism internationally.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog addressed the crowd via video from the Western Wall in Jerusalem. After 'the largest massacre since the Holocaust,' he said, 'let us call out together, never again.
"No one will break us,' he pledged. 'We will rise again … There is no greater and just cause than this.'
Rachel Goldberg, whose 23-year-old son,  , was snatched by Hamas after the group attacked a music festival, also addressed the crowd, noting those taken captive ranged in age from just nine months to 87 years and were of different religions and nationalities.
"Our hearts are bruised and seeping with misery," she said. "Why is the world accepting that 240 human beings from almost 30 countries have been stolen?"
Many of the demonstrators wore Israeli flags wrapped around their shoulders or held small Israeli flags in their hands turning their anger on Hamas.

Banners and placards showed the names and photos of people being held captive in Gaza, with the crowd shouting, 'Bring them home!'
Other signs read "Annihilate Hamas" and "  , we support democracy."
Security was tight, with trucks blocking access to the mall and police keeping a close watch on the area.
Melanie Lubin of Olney, Maryland, wore a flag that combined the Stars and Stripes with Israel's blue and white Star of David.
Asked about the death toll in Gaza and criticism of the way Israel has conducted its military campaign, she said: 'I think everyone is concerned about what is happening in Gaza and to civilians in Israel. Israel is doing its best. This is a war. Israel did not start this war."
Mark Moore, a 48-year-old Christian pastor from Chicago, said he considered Israel "the only bastion of freedom" in the Middle East.
"I'm praying for peace… secured through victory so it does not continue with this endless cycle of violence," he said.

Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip – In an area less than 3 square km (1.1sq miles), 100,000 people are struggling to survive. This small patch of Gaza is rapidly becoming uninhabitable.
"We place waste in remote areas on the outskirts of the camp, but these spaces are full,' Hatem al-Ghamri, the mayor of the Maghazi refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, told Al Jazeera. 'We are facing a real disaster."
Maghazi, the smallest of Gaza's refugee camps, located near Deir el-Balah in the centre of the enclave, normally houses 30,000 people. Now, with the displacement of residents fleeing Israel's relentless bombardment in the north and the west, the population has more than trebled while Israel's   have continued on homes and shelters here.
The camp is running into serious trouble. With waste piling up, a total lack of water and massive overcrowding, outbreaks of disease have begun.
Despite its location on the southern side of the Strip – where Israeli forces ordered civilians from the north to flee before they began their ground invasion from the north – the small camp has been subjected to intense artillery and  .
Such air raids on civilian camps and infrastructure have become commonplace. The Jabalia refugee camp has been targeted at least  , resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians. Civilian infrastructure, including schools, has also been subjected to   in the south.

Bakery and water wells bombed
At the Maghazi camp, Israeli air raids destroyed the only bakery in the camp on October 26, the mayor said. For seven consecutive days, not a single loaf of bread has been distributed to any of the residents.
The Maghazi camp includes two centres of shelter for displaced civilians in two UNRWA schools, each now accommodating 12,000 people. A third UNRWA school was bombed.
With the overcrowding, displaced people in UNRWA schools are facing mounting challenges, including the spread of diseases such as smallpox and scabies, and a lack of access to essential resources such as water, food and children's necessities like diapers and milk. Women also lack access to sanitary towels.
"The Maghazi camp has seven water wells, two of which were targeted by the occupation in the eastern area,' al-Ghamri said. 'The remaining five wells cannot be operated by the municipality due to the Israeli occupation's prevention of fuel entry into the Gaza Strip.
"We need 300 to 500 litres of fuel to operate the five wells, and it also requires us to pump 3,000 cups. With the increase in the number of displaced people, we need to pump double the amount, but we cannot."
Insects and epidemics have started to spread in the Maghazi camp due to the accumulation of significant amounts of waste. Workers can no longer access the usual landfill dumps in Wadi Gaza and east of the city of Rafah.
Besides the spread of disease, people are facing the prospect of starvation. "We face significant challenges in providing food in Maghazi camp," al-Ghamri said.
'All municipalities in the Gaza Strip suffer from deteriorating machinery that needs to be replaced, and we work to maintain them periodically," he said.
"There are only two vehicles available in the Maghazi municipality, and they are not only used for municipal tasks but also for transporting the injured due to the repeated violent Israeli attacks. They are also used to transport food aid."

Arrival of flour 'a miracle'
The municipality of Maghazi has received 1,000 bags of flour, but only by chance, the mayor said.
"The flour was provided miraculously. When the occupation tanks targeted a car on Salah al-Din Street on Monday, we were in the area, and the UNRWA truck was on its way to Gaza City in the west of the Strip. It refused to continue its journey and contacted UNRWA to distribute this amount to the Maghazi camp [instead]," al-Ghamri said.
It won't last long, however. The mayor explained that the camp needs 5,000 bags of flour, each containing 25kg, to provide for the residents and displaced people here every few days.
There are 30 Maghazi municipality workers, each working for eight hours on normal days. These days, they are working around the clock, under increasingly dangerous conditions.
"When one of the wells was targeted, municipal employees were working there,' al-Ghamri said. 'Miraculously, they survived, and some of them were injured by shrapnel from the bombing.
'Under the coordination of UNRWA, the Red Cross and the Water Authority in Ramallah, a municipal employee inspected the main water line for the entire central region of the Gaza Strip. We are currently working to repair it after the Israeli occupation targeted and destroyed it.'
The mayor said the municipality is running out of options.
'Israeli aggression in the Gaza Strip has resulted in the killing of 10,000 Palestinians, the majority of whom are children and women. Israel is targeting doctors, health sector workers, journalists, ambulance personnel, and civil defence personnel.
'Everyone in Gaza is being targeted.'

McDonald's franchises in Middle East at odds over Israel-Hamas war

Pulitzer Prize-winning commentator Thomas Friedman in the late 1990s famously claimed that two countries with McDonald's outlets had never gone to war.
But as fighting rages between Israel and Hamas, the iconic American fast food chain is at war with itself.
McDonald's franchises in the Middle East have weighed in on opposing sides of the conflict, with branches in Muslim countries disavowing a decision by McDonald's Israel to provide free meals to the Israeli military.
Franchises in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt, Bahrain and Turkey have issued statements distancing themselves from their Israeli counterpart and collectively pledging more than $3m to support Palestinians in Gaza, which is being bombarded by Israel in response to Hamas's October 7 attack on the country.
'Let us all combine our efforts and support the community in Gaza with everything we can,' McDonald's Oman, which has pledged $100,000 towards humanitarian relief efforts in Gaza, posted on X on Sunday.
'We ask God Almighty to protect our beloved country and all Arab and Muslim countries from all the evil and hate.'

- McDonald's Oman (@Mcdonaldsoman) October 14, 2023
Since announcing its support for the Israeli army, McDonald's Israel has changed its Instagram account to 'private' following a backlash from consumers in Arab and Muslim countries.
While McDonald's ranks among the most iconic American brands, most of its restaurants worldwide are locally owned and operated.
McDonald's headquarters in Chicago, the United States did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment.
The case of McDonald's highlights the tricky geopolitical dynamics that globe-spanning brands must navigate in an era where businesses are often expected to weigh in on hot-button social and political issues.
The controversy has also revived discussion of the so-called Golden Arches theory of conflict prevention, popularised by Friedman in his 1999 book The Lexus and The Olive Tree.
The theory – that countries with enough wealth and stability to support a major chain like McDonald's do not go to war with each other – has been widely discredited following conflicts among countries with the brand, including the 1998-99 Kosovo War and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
McDonald's does not have any outlets in Gaza or the occupied West Bank but Israel has clashed with Hezbollah fighters in neighbouring Lebanon, which does have the American chain.
'We're in a post-'Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention' world now for sure,' Paul Musgrave, an associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told Al Jazeera.
'Even though Russia and Ukraine both had McDonald's in 2022, they still went to war. Now, conflicts within the McDonald's empire mirror the real stresses and passions of the region.'
McDonald's is not the first global brand to be drawn into controversy due to its stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict.
United Kingdom-based multinational Unilever came under fire from investors last year for failing to disclose that its ice cream brand subsidiary Ben and Jerry's had decided to boycott Israeli-occupied territory in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2021.
Spanish retailer Zara was boycotted by some shoppers last year after the chairman of its Israeli franchise, Canadian-Israeli businessman Joey Schwebel, hosted a campaign event for far-right Israeli minister Itamar Ben-Gvir at his home.
Major brands have also found themselves drawn into controversies about the human rights records of other countries such as China.
In 2021, Japanese retailer MUJI faced criticism after publicly endorsing cotton grown in China's Xinjiang region, where human rights activists say ethnic minority Muslims are exploited for forced labour.
Musgrave said that 'the dream that capitalism and trade would quiet nationalism and other forms of fervour has been revealed to have some holes".
'Having different franchises of McDonald's end up on different [rhetorical] sides is another example of how politics permeates everything."

'We were baptised here and we will die here': Gaza's oldest church bombed

Gaza City – Ibrahim Jahsan's young family has been sheltering at the Saint Porphyrius Church in Gaza City since the war began.
One of Gaza's 1,000 Christians, Jahsan never doubted the church was a safe space for him, his pregnant wife and two children aged five and six. The Greek Orthodox church – the oldest in the city, located in the Zaytoun neighbourhood – has traditionally served as a sanctuary for both Christians and Muslims during Israel's periodic wars against Gaza.
The church was sheltering hundreds of people when an Israeli bomb severely   one of the four buildings in its compound on Thursday evening, causing its ceiling to collapse and leaving dozens trapped under slabs of concrete, according to witnesses.
By Friday afternoon, the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem told Al Jazeera at least 18 people were confirmed to have been killed, including several children.

'We thought we would be protected'
'The building that they bombed is beside the church,' said Jahsan, still shaken from what he says was a massive blast. 'We just pray to god to end this war.'
About 200 children, women, elderly and sick people were taking shelter at the church when Israeli warplanes targeted the building with two raids, said Ibrahim Al-Souri, another survivor who had also been taking shelter.
"We thought we would be protected by the church but unfortunately the brutal Israeli occupation does not differentiate," he said. "They have targeted churches, mosques and hospitals. There is no safe place."
Al-Souri called on free people around the world to pressure their governments to stop the bloodshed against Palestinians.
"We know that the world leaders are against us, but as [former PLO leader] Yasser Arafat said, we are a mighty people. And this is the price we have to pay," he said.
According to Father Issa Musleh of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Bethlehem, the building that collapsed was part of the church's compound. Dozens were found to have been injured as rescue efforts were still under way on Friday to find victims trapped under the rubble.
'One lady is waiting for her three kids to be pulled out of the rubble,' said another witness at the church, who did not want to give Al Jazeera his real name. 'It's something you can't really imagine, you can't really explain.'

An Orthodox Christian, he said he had sought refuge at the church after the war began, thinking it was a safe place. He remained there despite Israel's order for residents of Gaza City to move south – where bombings have continued nonetheless.
'We didn't flee last night because we were afraid we might be hit [on the way],' he said.
Since the war began, mosques, schools and hospitals where people have sought safety after fleeing their homes have come under fire. Just two days ago, six people were killed after an Israeli air raid hit an UNRWA school in Gaza's al-Maghazi refugee camp. Later that day, a   at the al-Ahli Arab Hospital killed hundreds more.
'People there – Muslims and Christians – they thought they'd be safe inside the [church] building,' Father Issa Musleh told Al Jazeera. 'Because it's a church, they didn't think it would be bombed by Israel.'
One Christian, who only gave his name as Fadi, said nobody is safe in Gaza, regardless of religion.
"This message is to Biden, the president of the United States: The Christian community in Gaza is being targeted," the 31-year-old who was born and raised in Gaza said. "No one is safe and everyone is in danger. Everyone should move to stop this."

'This is a war crime': Orthodox Patriarchate
The Patriarchate has condemned  the strike, but said it remains committed to providing shelter to the displaced.
'Targeting churches and their institutions, along with the shelters they provide to protect innocent citizens, especially children and women who have lost their homes due to Israeli air strikes on residential areas over the past 13 days, constitutes a war crime that cannot be ignored,' a statement read.
An Israeli army statement said the air strike had targeted a command and control centre involved in launching rockets and mortars towards Israel.
'As a result of the [Israeli army] strike, a wall of a church in the area was damaged,' it said, adding, 'We are aware of reports on casualties. The incident is under review.'
Videos and photos of the incident show people, including children and elderly women, being rushed to hospital, as well as the damaged building whose first floor has completely collapsed.
At least 4,137 Palestinians have been confirmed dead as a result of Israeli bombardment in the Gaza Strip since the war began, including 1,524 children. Some 1,403 Israelis have been killed, mostly in an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7.
'All the children are  ,' Ibrahim Jahsan said. 'No words can describe what we are going through.' Despite the horror, he said, he will continue to shelter at the church with his family.
'We were baptised here, and we will die here.'

Mass graves, rushed burials: Funeral rites bypass Gaza dead amid Israel war

Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip – It was late Friday night, and 28-year-old Amani al-Hor had just returned home when the missile struck her parents' home right next door.
Amani had spent a couple of hours there that evening, playing a card game with her cousin to take their minds off the sound of the aerial bombings. She had chatted to her siblings and then taken her four children, who she said were "being a nuisance", back to their own house.
There were eight families spanning three generations under her parents' roof that evening, in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Amani's parents, their married children, the grandchildren and other relatives who had been displaced from their homes had all gathered to be together.
Shortly after 8pm, an Israeli air attack targeted the house. At least 40 members of Amani's family were killed, including her parents, nearly all of her siblings and every one of their children.
The attack also damaged Amani's house.

"I just found the walls and ceiling falling on us," she said. "I didn't hear the sound of the missile. It was like being in a grave. Somehow, I grabbed my four children in the dark and we managed to get out."
Still in a state of shock, she began counting her family members that had been killed.
"My sister and her four children; my brother, his wife and their four daughters; my other sister-in-law, her son and two daughters – but her husband, my other brother survived," she said. "It was a very crowded building and the children made a lot of noise. Most of them are still under the rubble."
"I wish I could see my father," Amani said. "I only saw the back of him that night, he was telling my siblings something as I was leaving. My mother's body is torn into pieces. At the hospital, I only saw her arms, and her intestines had spilled out of her stomach."
Amani had been very close to her sisters, talking to them every day.
"I wish I was killed with them," she said.

No room left in cemeteries
More than 9,000 Palestinians – the majority of them women and children – have been killed by Israeli forces since they began their offensive on the Gaza Strip on October 7. More than 32,000 more have been wounded.
Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed every day and night since the bombing began, overwhelming hospitals, which are now in a state of collapse due to the total blockade imposed by Israel. Electricity, clean water and fuel have all run out, and there are no medical supplies or lifesaving treatments. At least 15 hospitals and medical centres have been forced to stop operating, meaning that patients have to be transferred to the remaining hospitals, which are already overcrowded.
The sheer number of casualties over the past 24 days has resulted in expedited funeral rites and burials, with the added anguish of laying family members to rest in mass graves.
"Before the war, funerals had rituals that were followed," said Mukhtar al-Hor, 57, and a relative of Amani. "Dozens or hundreds of people would pray over the deceased before carrying them to the cemetery to be buried. Now, there are barely a handful of people available to pray over their loved ones."
The cemetery in Deir el-Balah has run out of room and as a result, mass graves are being dug for necessity [Ashraf Amra/Al Jazeera]
Mukhtar said that at least 18 bodies had so far been pulled out from under the rubble in the Nuseirat refugee camp, but some of them were body parts that could not be identified.
"I cannot describe what it is like to bury your family in a mass grave," he said. "They are devoid of the funeral rites that we were used to during ordinary times."
Diab al-Jaru, the Mayor of Deir el-Balah, said that the town has seen at least 20 major attacks carried out by Israel over the past four weeks against its residents and displaced people who have sought shelter there.
"So far, more than 400 people have been killed in Deir el-Balah alone," he told Al Jazeera. "The large number of people killed means that we have run out of room in the cemetery, which was already full, as before the war we would bury two to three people from the same family in one grave."
Now, the mayor said there is no other option than burying people in mass graves, usually separated by gender.
"Friday night alone saw 150 people killed. We had no choice but to bury them all together," al-Jaru said.
The mayor of Deir al-Balah said that the town has seen at least 20 massacres carried out by Israel [Ashraf Amra/Al Jazeera]
Shrouded, prayed over and buried
Palestinians often refer to those killed in Israeli attacks as "martyrs" and their funeral processions usually hold a deep meaning for the people of their communities.
But the current, exceptional assault on Gaza has cut short not just these processions, but also the burial rituals which usually followed.
In normal circumstances, after being washed, the body of a loved one is taken to the family home where women are able to bid a final farewell. Then the body is taken to the mosque to be prayed over by the men, before being transported either in a vehicle or carried by people in a large congregation to the cemetery.
Abu Ammar is the supervisor for washing bodies according to Islamic rituals at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah. He said he has been receiving hundreds of bodies on a daily basis since the assault began nearly four weeks ago.
Now, the funeral prayer is performed on hospital grounds immediately after the body is washed, attended by only a smattering of people or anyone who is available, before being taken to be buried in a mass grave without headstones instead of a single grave with a marble headstone.
"Before the war, the bodies of adults would be wrapped in three different shrouds," he said.
Abu Ammar, who washes the bodies of dead people at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, said he has never seen such mutilated bodies before [Ashraf Amra/Al Jazeera]
"We would wash them with water and soap twice, and on the third time, we would use camphor. But under these current circumstances, we don't have the time or means to do that. Instead, we shroud them immediately in one piece due to the shortages we are facing, and try to wipe away the blood from their faces."
Torn body parts, he added, are wrapped first in a plastic covering and then covered with a shroud, in order not to stain it.
Due to the sheer number, the hospital's administration has been forced to lay out some of the bodies outside in the courtyard.
Ammar, who has a quiet demeanour, said he has seen a shocking number of mutilated bodies.
"I have received bodies burned beyond recognition, bodies with torn limbs, skulls emptied and broken, bodies reeking of chemical smells," the 45-year-old said.
"The most violent weapons, made by the US, are being used against us," he added. "This aggression has crossed all red lines and violated every international human rights law. The world must stop this barbaric war against us."

Why is Gaza out of fuel — and what now?

Israel has bombarded the  , home to about 2.3 million people, with missiles since the Palestinian group Hamas launched a surprise attack last weekend.
Now, the enclave is without power, pushed into a complete energy blackout after Gaza's sole power plant will run out of fuel on Wednesday, affecting essential services including hospitals.
Where does Gaza get its electricity?
Israel   and blocked the entry of food and fuel to the Gaza Strip as part of a 'total siege' strategy adopted on Monday, in retaliation against the Hamas attack.
Egypt also closed its crossing into Gaza on Tuesday after Israeli air raids hit the border area.
With the enclave's sole power plant running out of electricity, its people will now rely solely on backup fuel-run generators.
However, the Palestinian Health Minister Mai al-Kaila announced that 'the fuel stock to operate the generators in the Gaza Strip hospitals will end tomorrow, Thursday, which will exacerbate the disastrous conditions in the hospitals.'
Why can't Gaza get more fuel?
The Gaza Strip has been under an Israeli land, air and sea blockade for the best part of two decades.
That has meant that the people of Gaza are cut off from the rest of the world, and live in what many human rights and law experts have described as an open-air prison.
The blockade has also meant that the Gaza Strip depends on fuel, food and medical supplies that come from or pass through Israel.
With the "total siege" in place, even that's not possible any more.
This, in turn, means bringing in any fuel for the power plant or the fuel-run generators is effectively impossible.
Srinivas Burra, an international humanitarian law expert and professor at New Delhi's South Asian University described Israel's actions as a "clear violation" of international law.
"Israel's prime minister has said that his country is at war. Once you make that declaration, you are required under international law to follow the rules of war," Burra told Al Jazeera.
Israel isn't doing that, he said.
"It's the first rule of war: It must stay between combatants," Burra added. "When you punish civilians in the way Israel is doing, that's clearly illegal."
How badly are hospitals affected?
Hospitals in the besieged enclave, already  , are relying on generators that are not equipped to power many critical medical devices, said Hassan Khalaf, the medical director of Al-Wafa Hospital in Gaza City.
Khalaf predicted the generators have a life of only 'maximum: a few days', and may be as short as a day or two, amid dwindling fuel supplies resulting from the complete blockade.
He said there are currently 100 newborn babies relying on electricity-powered medical equipment in the Gaza Strip. 'These newborns, they could not survive … because they depend in every aspect of life on electricity and equipment,' he told Al Jazeera. 'They are very tiny. They are very weak.'
The doctor also said there were about 1,100 patients who rely on dialysis machines for survival in Gaza, saying the Israeli siege amounts to 'mass killing'.
How has the international community responded?
On Tuesday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volcker Turk said Israel's refusal to supply food, fuel and other essential commodities to the Gaza Strip was prohibited under international law.
Even the European Union, which has strongly backed Israel's assertion that its response to the Hamas attack was driven by a desire for self-defence, has criticised the total siege on Gaza.
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, on Tuesday said Israel was violating international law.

Starvation used as a 'weapon of war' on civilians in Gaza: Oxfam

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Oxfam has renewed its call for essential goods to enter the besieged Gaza Strip and said starvation was being used as a 'weapon of war' after Israel cut off supplies of food, water, electricity and fuel to the territory.
Israel imposed a "complete siege" on Gaza after Hamas fighters launched an attack from Gaza on southern Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,400 people according to Israeli authorities.
In addition to the siege, Israel has bombarded the territory relentlessly, killing more than 6,600 people, according to authorities in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas.
United Nations officials have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe and UN agencies and   for Israel to allow more aid trucks into Gaza. Fewer than 70 relief trucks have entered the   since the war began.
In a statement on Wednesday, Oxfam said only 'two percent of food that would have been delivered has entered Gaza since the total siege'.
To overcome the urgent food crisis, Oxfam said about 104 trucks a day would be needed to deliver food to Gaza.
Sally Abi Khalil, Oxfam's regional Middle East director, said, 'The situation is nothing short of horrific – where is humanity? Millions of civilians are being collectively punished in full view of the world, there can be no justification for using starvation as a weapon of war. World leaders cannot continue to sit back and watch, they have an obligation to act and to act now.'
'Every day, the situation worsens. Children are experiencing severe trauma from the constant bombardment; their drinking water is polluted or rationed, and soon families may not be able to feed them too. How much more are Gazans expected to endure?' Khalil added.

Referencing international humanitarian law, which prohibits starvation as a method of warfare, Oxfam said it was 'becoming painfully clear that the unfolding humanitarian situation in Gaza fits the prohibition condemned in the resolution'.
The NGO also called for the UN Security Council (UNSC) and member states to prevent the situation from worsening and demanded an immediate ceasefire so all necessary food, fuel, water, and medical supplies can be met.
The UNSC is expected on Wednesday to consider proposals from the United States, which hopes to secure support for short pauses in the conflict to allow more aid to enter Gaza, and a Russian resolution calling for a broader ceasefire.
[Al Jazeera]
On Tuesday, UN agencies said they were pleading for unimpeded aid into Gaza and said more than 20 times the current deliveries were needed to support the population.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said medicines and health supplies had been delivered to three essential referral hospitals in southern Gaza. However, they still needed to reach the north of the Palestinian enclave.

No one is left to mourn in Gaza, as Israel's bombs deliver daily death

Deir el-Balah, Gaza – Welcome to Gaza, a place where every phone call bears the news of somebody being killed, every message conveys the destruction of a friend's home, and each air strike sends tremors of fear through your heart.
In this land, "home" is no longer a sanctuary for living and relaxation; it's a precarious existence, subject to sudden devastation without warning.
The biggest hope one clings to is simply staying alive with their family, avoiding the heart-wrenching loss of a loved one or facing a collective demise.
Consider the families erased from the civil registry, obliterated together. At first glance, it seems like a catastrophe, but on closer examination, it resembles a tragic yet merciful conclusion under the relentless bombings.
No one is left to mourn. And in a way, some people envy those who found a peaceful end, escaping the ongoing madness of shelling and killing.

Scanning the news – on the rare occasions when there's internet access – and witnessing the chaos surrounding aid trucks entering Gaza, one can't help but find the world's priorities bewildering.
Rather than focusing on efforts to stop the war, the emphasis seems to be on delivering aid.
What the people of Gaza need even more than food, water or other assistance is an end to the senseless violence, bloodshed and destruction. They cry out for the war to stop.
It is now day 18, and for three days, I've been unable to share these notes in my diary because of the lack of internet access. Yet, despite the passage of time, nothing changes significantly. Gaza remains trapped in the repetitive cycle of death and devastation that the world has grown accustomed to seeing.
Death after death
Yesterday, the heart-wrenching news arrived about the death of  , a dear friend. The shock of his loss was hard to accept. Thoughts lingered on his wife, Shorouq, another friend, and their one-year-old daughter, Dania.
The day before, my sisters and I awoke to even more devastating news: a friend's family of nine had been killed. This family included the mother, Nibal, and her daughters: Saja, Doha, Sana, Mariyam, and Lana, along with her son, Mohammed. They perished after Israeli orders to leave Gaza sent them to their relatives' home in Deir el-Balah. Only Noor, a married daughter in Qatar, survived this tragedy.
The news cycle's constant churn offers little respite to process the anguish of losing loved ones and mourn them properly.
Noor's tearful voice on the phone from Doha, pleading with us to take photos of her family who were already buried in silence, evoked the words of the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish: 'Death doesn't hurt the dead, it only hurts the living.'

Israel says it won't block humanitarian aid entering Gaza from Egypt

The Israeli government has said that it will not block humanitarian aid entering the besieged Gaza Strip from Egypt, following pressure from its international allies to allow aid to reach Palestinian civilians in the territory.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced the decision in a statement on Wednesday, during a visit from US President Joe Biden.
"In light of President Biden's demand, Israel will not thwart humanitarian supplies from Egypt as long as it is only food, water and medicine for the civilian population in the southern Gaza Strip," the statement reads.
"Israel will not allow any humanitarian aid from its territory to the Gaza Strip as long as our hostages are not returned," it added.
The decision follows mounting international pressure, including from the United States, calling for humanitarian assistance to enter Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of residents have been displaced amid constant Israeli air strikes.
Israel has also instituted a complete siege of Gaza, cutting off access to food, water, electricity and fuel for the strip's 2.3 million residents.
It remains unclear when aid will begin to enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, which Egypt says has been damaged by Israeli air strikes.
This is a developing story. More to follow.

Israeli bombardments have caused damage to more than 50 percent of housing units across Gaza, according to local officials.
In a statement published on Friday, the media office of Gaza's government said about 40,000 housing units in the besieged enclave were completely destroyed by the Israeli army.
It also said about 32,000 tons (29,000 tonnes) of explosives had been dropped on Gaza since the start of the war on October 7 when Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, attacked Israel, prompting a retaliation.
The estimated preliminary losses in the housing sector and infrastructure are estimated to be $2bn each, the office said.
A new analysis by two United States-based researchers, James Van Den Hoek and Corey Scher, and Al Jazeera's AJ Labs unit showed that overall at least 16 percent of all buildings in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed. In Gaza City alone, the building destruction reached at least 28 percent.
According to the latest data from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Palestinian government, and as of November 7, Israeli attacks have damaged at least 222,000 residential units, with more than 40,000 completely destroyed.
The UN report also said 278 educational facilities, 270 healthcare facilities and 69 places of worship were damaged, including mosques and churches.

The Sydney Opera House: 50 years as 'the people's house'

The white sails of the Sydney Opera House in Australia seemed like "an obvious canvas for an important message", recalled David Burgess, even if scaling the building with a tin of red paint was a 'bit hairy'.
It was March 2003, and Burgess along with his friend Will Saunders had been watching the build-up of troops ahead of the  . So they came up with a plan to write "NO WAR" somewhere that the world would see it.
The opera house seemed like the right place for their protest, since "most people around Sydney have some sort of connection with the building", Saunders told Al Jazeera in an interview ahead of the iconic building's 50th anniversary,
It is this sense of connection that lies behind "The People's House" being chosen as the theme of official celebrations this month. Fifty years after construction was completed, it is worth looking back at how the title was earned and whether it remains true today.
'Hats, cupcakes, flower petals, [dishes drying on a rack], even a camper van," these are just some of the ways that the Sydney Opera House's sails have been imagined, Cristina Garduño Freeman, a senior lecturer in Architectural History at the University of New South Wales told Al Jazeera.
The affectionate nicknames are just one way that Freeman says the building has been 'embraced by the public', adding to its icon status.
But the opera house, designed by the Danish architect Jorn Utzon, has always been far more than a beautiful building.
In 1960, 13 years before construction was eventually completed, the workers who built it held one of its most memorable performances.
They had invited African-American singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson  to perform at the construction site as part of his first world tour since the United States returned his passport that had been taken away because of his political beliefs. Some of the builders hung from scaffolding to get a better view of Robeson as he sang Ol' Man River in his deep rolling baritone.
Thirty years after Robeson sang for the builders, another civil rights icon, Nelson Mandela stood on the steps of the by-then-completed opera house to address a crowd of 40,000 people.

Mandela chose Sydney as one of his first international destinations after   in part because of the support he received from the anti-apartheid movement in Australia.
Together, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House have made the shores of the Sydney harbour one of the most iconic skylines in the world.
But a   at Barangaroo now towers far above them both.
Tone Wheeler, a registered architect and president of the Australian Architecture Association, told Al Jazeera that the Barangaroo precinct was one of many examples of more commercially-based projects winning out over-ambitious architectural designs in Sydney in recent years.
Australia is building fewer public projects than it did in the past, says Wheeler, noting the growing number of art galleries, sporting facilities and social housing projects built as public-private partnerships, a trend not limited to Australia.
Such partnerships often have a closer focus on costs.
'I think architecture has become very commodified and it's also become very conservative,' said Wheeler, who says "all the evidence" suggests an ambitious design like the Sydney Opera House would not have been built in Australia today.
And while the Sydney Opera House may be known as "the people's house," Sydney itself has become one of the   places to live in the world.
Commercial creep
Even the opera house has not avoided the creep of commercial interests.
In 2018, Australia's then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison welcomed a proposal to use the building to advertise a horse race, describing the opera house as the city's "biggest billboard".

Other recent projections include a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, a ribbon in remembrance of people killed in the catastrophic   and the colours of the Ukrainian flag.
But the speed at which images can now be projected onto the building has raised questions about what does, and does not, get reflected on its white surface.
Earlier this month, as the building was illuminated in blue and white, the colours of the Israeli flag, hundreds of people wearing the colours of the Palestinian flag gathered in the forecourt below.
The decision, reportedly made by the New South Wales state government, was questioned by Sydney's Lord Mayor Clover Moore.
"We're a multicultural community; we have large Muslim and Jewish communities, people from Israel, people from Palestine, we should support both communities," she said.
Projecting images on the opera house is perhaps a much easier way to send a message than scaling its heights with a tin of red paint, but Burgess says that artists and activists have also projected their works onto its sails.
The Vivid Sydney festival of lights, which began in 2009, 'really showed what could be done with that canvas", he said.
The landmark is a centrepiece of the festival, with the sails turned into art installations and some venues taking place inside.

And the images projected on the opera house have not always had official backing, Burgess recalls.
Back in 2001, Deborah Kelly and a group of artists calling themselves boatpeople.org projected a tall ship, similar to the one on which British settlers arrived in Australia, above the words 'boat people' on the side of the opera house. The protest came after then-Prime Minister John Howard refused to accept asylum seekers who had been rescued after   off the coast of Australia, which led to the creation of Australia's  .
Reflecting on the day he and Saunders scaled the building to write "NO WAR," Burgess says it was 'still relevant, in the sense of bearing witness', even if the Iraq invasion went ahead, with Australia among the countries participating. He hopes their message at least "made a few politicians think twice about committing their nations to war.'
Burgess and Saunders's protest is now documented in an exhibit at the Australian War Memorial but, at the time, they were convicted of 'malicious damage' and served weekends in prison for about nine months.
They were also ordered to pay more than $150,000 Australian dollars ($94,828) towards the costs of the workers who had to abseil down the opera house to scrub away their message. They raised the money through benefit concerts and other more old-fashioned fundraising techniques in the days before mass online fundraisers.
Burgess still enjoys visiting the opera house – he saw the band the Pixies there and has eaten meals on the foreshore overlooking the landmark.
On these visits, he sees the security fence erected after their protest has remained.
"I guess that was our contribution to the design of the Opera House".

Papua New Guinea opens Israel embassy in West Jerusalem

Papua New Guinea has opened its   in West Jerusalem, becoming only the fifth country with a full diplomatic mission in a city whose status is one of the most sensitive issues in the Middle East.
The Pacific nation's mission joins embassies from the  , Kosovo, Guatemala and Honduras in West Jerusalem, while most countries maintain their diplomatic representation in the coastal city of Tel Aviv, Israel's main economic hub.
While Israel considers Jerusalem its indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there, most of the world does not recognise Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, believing its status should be resolved in negotiations.
Palestinian leadership has wanted the capital of their own independent state in occupied East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognised internationally.
Israel has continued to build illegal settlements in East Jerusalem, as well as the  .
Israel will pay for the embassy, located in a high-rise opposite Jerusalem's biggest mall, for the first two years, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape was quoted in the Papua New Guinea Post-Courier newspaper.
Marape also pledged support at the United Nations for Israel, whose leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attended the embassy ceremony in a reprieve from stalled regional peacemaking and clouded ties with Washington.
"Many nations choose not to open their embassies in Jerusalem, but we have made a conscious choice," Marape said at the embassy's inauguration ceremony.
"For us to call ourselves Christian, paying respect to God will not be complete without recognising that Jerusalem is the universal capital of the people and the nation of Israel," Marape said.
Wassel Abu Youssef, an official with the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation, said Israel was "looking for any country – even if that country can only be seen under a microscope – so it can claim there are countries opening embassies in Jerusalem".
Papua New Guinea, which occupies the eastern half of the West Pacific Island of New Guinea, has an economy based on agriculture and mining. Its bilateral trade with Israel is worth just $1m a year, according to Israeli authorities.
Netanyahu said the new embassy would make it easier to develop agriculture, health, water and technology projects. "This will not only enable us to cherish the past but also seize the future," he said at the ceremony.

What we know about UN draft resolutions on the Israel-Hamas war so far

After two failed attempts to pass controversial resolutions on the   at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the council held its first open debate on the conflict last night with 90 member states on the speaker list.
Amidst urgent calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, and tense support by some countries for Israel's right of self-defence, the UNSC is likely to vote on new resolutions this week, primarily a draft being proposed by the United States.
The council can only adopt a resolution if at least nine of its 15 members vote in favour of it and no veto is used by one of the five permanent members. A shortage of favourable votes and a veto from the US has kept resolutions from manifesting so far.
Here's what to know about the two resolutions that failed to pass, and two others to watch in the coming days:
Russian-led draft resolution on October 16
Main points: Humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, release of all people taken into captivity since October 7, access to aid, and safe evacuation of civilians.
Voting: Five voted in favour (including China, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates), four voted against (France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States), and six abstained (including Brazil, Ecuador, and Switzerland).
Main criticism by those opposed: The resolution did   or condemn Hamas.
Russia's permanent representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, said the West's opposition crushed "global hopes" for the council to end violence and stemmed from "selfish and political" interests.
US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the resolution was "dishonouring" victims and unfairly shifting blame for the conflict from Hamas to Israel.
Riyad Mansour, permanent observer of the Observer State of Palestine to the UN, urged the council not to suggest "that Palestinian lives do not matter" and said that Israel's actions in Gaza are a "massacre," not a military operation.
Gilad Erdan, permanent representative of Israel, said the council stood at a "pivotal moment" in history, that Israel had the right to defend itself, and that all captives with Hamas should be released unconditionally.
Brazil-led draft resolution on October 18
Main point: "Humanitarian pauses" for full and unhindered aid into Gaza, condemnation of violence against all civilians, rescission of Israel's evacuation order.
Voting: Twelve countries voted in favour, two (Russia, and the United Kingdom) abstained, while the US submitted the only opposing vote.
  on behalf of the US, Thomas-Greenfield said the resolution did not mention Israel's right of self-defence. In light of President Joe Biden's visit to Israel at the time, she added that diplomacy on the ground needed to "play out".
Brazilian ambassador, Srgio Frana Danese, said urgent measures were necessary, and regretted the council's inaction.
Abstaining member UK also said the text needed to clearly mention Israel's right of self-defence, and that they would continue to work on alleviating the humanitarian crisis.
[Al Jazeera]
The upcoming US draft resolution
The US is drafting a resolution of its own to present to the Security Council that will likely be presented this week.
Main points: It does not call for a full ceasefire but a "humanitarian pause" allowing aid in Gaza." The text will include a   for the 'inherent right of all states' to self-defence, calls for compliance with international law, and a call for Hamas to release all its captives.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the draft 'incorporates substantive feedback".
Russia has also put forward a   to vote on this week.
Russian draft #UNSC  resolution on #Gaza  and #Israel  is quite cunningly designed to look like a compromise text (adapting paras from Brazil and U.S. drafts) while including one word ceasefire that the U.S. has explicitly rejected.
May get more votes than Russia's first effort. https://t.co/5i8RLEZN62
- Richard Gowan (@RichardGowan1) October 24, 2023
Jordan's draft resolution for the UN General Assembly
Jordan will be presenting a draft resolution to the UNGA's emergency meeting on Israel-Gaza this Thursday.
Main points: Immediate ceasefire in Gaza, Israel to revoke its call for northern Gaza's evacuation, full and unhindered access to humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip.
It also calls on parties to abide by international law and "the immediate release of all civilians." The text refers to Israel as an "occupying power," according to a version of the draft posted to X, formerly Twitter.
Although the resolution would not be binding like the Security Council's, it will still be   if passed.

Israel-Hamas deal: What makes a truce lead to lasting peace?

November 23rd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
After six weeks of war, Israel and Hamas have agreed to a   that would pause fighting for four days and make way for an exchange of captives and prisoners.
Since October 7, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people, Gaza has been devastated by bombardments of air and ground attacks that have left more than 14,000 Palestinians dead, mostly women and children.
On Wednesday, Israel's government agreed to a pause in fighting that could begin as soon as Friday.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that the truce is temporary and that the war will continue after it ends. However, there are numerous examples in the past century of truces that have been instrumental in ending wars – as well as many that didn't.
Here's a look at truces from previous conflicts, what have we learned from them, and whether the pause between Israel and Hamas can lead to lasting peace.
Pauses that led to peace
Even small measures of trust and goodwill on both sides allow ceasefires to develop into lasting long-term peace, said Madhav Joshi, a research professor and associate director of the Peace Accords Matrix at the University of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies.
With 'a negotiated agreement between adversaries where reforms are pursued across many different policy domains,' real peace may be the outcome, he said.
Ethiopia - TPLF agreement (2022): Two years of fighting between the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) in the north of the country, and failed ceasefire attempts, led to the deaths of at least 100,000 people killed in the war by late 2022.
But on November 2, 2022, the two sides signed the Pretoria Agreement, which halted the fighting between the Ethiopian government forces and the TPLF.
Joshi told Al Jazeera that the Pretoria Agreement is an excellent example of how a pause in fighting can lead to peace.
Yet what happened in Ethiopia goes far beyond what Israel and Hamas have agreed to. Their deal has no formal written text, no monitoring mechanism and includes no responsibility on either side to address the deeper root causes underlying their conflict.
In Ethiopia, by contrast, b oth parties agreed to a permanent end to hostilities, on both sides, along with the disarmament of the TPLF and reintegration of the Tigrayan people.
'While a larger peace process faces many obstacles, the agreement in Ethiopia includes a verification mechanism, a framework and commitment to address underlying political differences and matters arising out of the conflict. And in this case, that's all that's been necessary in finding a way towards peace,' he said.
A year after the deal in Ethiopia,   — even though much of Tigray remains devastated.
Korean Armistice Agreement (1953): Technically, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) are still in a state of war since they never signed a peace deal after a bloody three-year war.
South Korea was backed by the US in the war, and North Korea by communist China and the Soviet Union. An estimated 2 million people died, though some accounts suggest the death toll could have been as high as 5 million.
Then, in July 1953, the fighting halted under an armistice agreement negotiated by the United States, United Nations and North Korea.
South Korea's then-President Syngman Rhee  refused to sign the agreement — he was insisting that his government be allowed to rule all of the Korean Peninsula.
Still, the other actors involved agreed to 'complete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force until a final peaceful settlement is achieved'.
They marked a 250km (155 miles) long and approximately 4km (2.5 miles) wide demilitarised zone between the two countries.
Since then, despite frequent tensions between North and South Korea, the two have avoided a major military conflagration.
Gulf War (1991): After 100,000 Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990, the UN Security Council responded with a trade embargo and sanctions on Iraq.
By January 1991, the US led an air and ground war ending with an Iraqi defeat and retreat from Kuwait in February 1991, with President George Bush declaring a ceasefire. Under the terms, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was not forced from power but was told to return land and property to Kuwait and recognise its sovereignty. Iraq was also ordered to get rid of all its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
This deal — which was unlike what Israel and Hamas have agreed to — ended the fighting between Iraq and Kuwait, but marked the beginning of Hussein's downfall just over a decade later in 2003.
Truce attempts that failed to lead to peace
Sudan civil war 2023 – ongoing: In April, civil war broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the leader of the SAF, and his former deputy, the RSF's General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, had once worked side by side in launching a military coup in 2021 after toppling the country's longtime President Omar al-Bashir. But, both parties wanted to fill the power vacuum and lead the country.
The   between them for much of the year, but multiple ceasefire agreements to stop the fighting have failed, and violence has instead escalated across Sudan.
In this case, both parties didn't 'refrain from seeking military advantage during the ceasefire', as had been agreed by the terms of the agreements, and the war continues on today.
Syrian Civil War, 2011 – ongoing: After Syrian pro-democracy activists led protests against President   in 2011, the Syrian regime responded by killing hundreds of demonstrators and imprisoning many more. Syria slid into war.
Since then at least 230,224 civilians have died in the conflict and 140 ceasefire attempts have failed. Proposed internationally mediated ceasefires, with the UN, US and Russia stepping in, and more informal local ceasefire attempts, were only aimed at temporary cessations of hostilities for humanitarian relief to enter or for groups to rearm - limiting any chance of a suspension of violence.
Research by the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) shows in 2016 there were a total of 43 ceasefires, but with each failed attempt violence escalated. In the years since, ceasefire deals decreased as did fighting. In 2020, just three ceasefires were declared.
Faysal Itani, once a senior fellow for the Atlantic Council and now director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, explained  in 2018 that the main cause of failed ceasefire attempts is the regime's outlook on the war, namely, the fact that it does not recognise the legitimacy of any opposition that challenges its political monopoly over Syria.
Six-Day War Ceasefire (1967): Israel, already occupying parts of Palestinian territory as prescribed by the UN in 1948, captured more — Gaza and the West Bank — as well as the Sinai from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria, in a war that lasted just six days.
A UN Security Council ceasefire was initially rejected by both Egypt and Syria, but with Israeli forces rapidly expanding forces into their lands, they acquiesced and by the sixth day of conflict all parties accepted a truce.
The ceasefire lasted for six years and by that measure, some believe it was a success. But it eventually fell apart after a peace agreement between Israel and neighbouring Arab states failed to agree upon Israel's security and an end to the occupation of Palestinian lands.
Will the Israel-Hamas truce lead to lasting peace?
Joshi of the University of Notre Dame said the 'narrow focus' of the current truce between Israel and Hamas, limited to 'a pause in fighting and prisoner swap', means it is 'destined to fail'.
If policy areas are left vague or untouched in peace agreements, as has been the case in previous rounds of Israel-Palestine talks, like the Oslo Accords and onwards - then there will always be the need for additional rounds of negotiations to enhance that agreement.
'Either that or violence will resume," Joshi said.
'As the deal between Hamas and Israel is likely not to include further talks and monitoring and verification components, it is not likely to stop violence beyond the proposed four-day period," he added. "It will not be surprising if the deal does fail outright.'
Truces that have worked were either a result of final rounds of multiple earlier failed ceasefires, or from a ceasefire negotiated as part of a larger peace process. The inclusion of a verification and monitoring provision can also lead to successful peace deals.
'A ceasefire deal will surely go wrong when one or both sides are still determined to defeat the other side militarily at the time of the ceasefire deal," said Joshi.
"There are plenty of examples of such failed ceasefires from Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, etc,' he added.
Along with Michael J Quinn, also from the University of Notre Dame, Joshi has researched  196 ceasefires and peace deals from 1975 - 2011, and found that 'over 85 percent of them mostly fail - meaning a resumption of conflict'.

Map: Which MENA countries have diplomatic ties with Israel?

September 15 marks three years since the United Arab Emirates normalised ties with Israel under a United States-brokered agreement known as the  .
The UAE became only the third Arab nation, after Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994), to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, ending a 25-year period without such ties.
Bahrain followed suit a month later and, in shortly afterwards, Sudan's transitional government announced they would normalise relations – but the idea was rejected by several Sudanese political parties and was not finalised. Then in December, Morocco agreed to establish full diplomatic and trade relations with Israel and establish direct flights between the two countries.
The deals, brokered by the Trump administration, broke years of consensus among most Arab states which had maintained any official recognition of Israel should be contingent upon the cessation of the occupation of Palestinian territory and the establishment of a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.
Egypt: In 1979, Egypt's President Anwar Sadat signed a peace treaty with Israel that had been negotiated during President Jimmy Carter's Camp David summit the previous year. According to the agreement, Israel would relinquish the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in exchange for Egypt's full recognition of the Jewish state and the establishment of full diplomatic relations.
Jordan: On October 26, 1994, King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin formally established peace during a ceremony witnessed by then-US President Bill Clinton. It came a year after the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO).
UAE: On September 15, 2020, US President Donald Trump together with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed agreements with Bahrain's Foreign Minister Abdullatif al-Zayani and Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
Morocco: On December 10, 2020, with the help of the US, Israel and Morocco agreed to establish full diplomatic and trade relations.
Sudan: Although Sudan was part of the Abraham Accords, it has yet to finalise the signing of a normalisation treaty with Israel.
What are diplomatic relations between states?
Diplomatic relations between two nations involve the mutual recognition of each other's sovereignty and government. This typically involves the exchange of ambassadors, bilateral agreements, economic ties and mutual cooperation.
Diplomatic relations and the conventions surrounding them are defined by international law and customs, which have evolved over time.
They have been codified in the 1961 United Nations Vienna Convention.
Trade between signatories of the Abraham Accords
Trade between Israel and the UAE surpassed $2.5bn in 2022 and reached $1.85bn in the first seven months of 2023 according to Reuters news agency.
In March 2023, a free trade agreement signed by Israel and the UAE came into effect, removing tariffs on about 96 percent of goods traded between the two. The deal aims to boost bilateral trade to more than $10bn over the next five years.
Trade with Bahrain was $8.5m in the same seven-month period. Israel opened its embassy in Bahrain on September 4 and an agreement between Israel and Bahrain's central bank on fintech was signed a few days later.
Israeli-Moroccan bilateral trade has also increased over the past three years, with Israel announcing last year that it wanted to target an annual trade volume of $500m with Morocco.
The Israeli government has also considered recognising Morocco's sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara, which Morocco claims.
How do Arab citizens view normalising ties with Israel?
According to the results of a survey conducted by Arab Barometer , a research group based at Princeton University, most citizens across the MENA region reject the normalisation of relations between Arab states and Israel.
In a survey conducted between October 2021 and July 2022 with 26,000 participants living in 11 populous MENA countries, participants were asked the question: 'To what extent do you favour or oppose the normalisation of relations between Arab states and Israel?'
In nine of the 11 countries surveyed, fewer than one in five said they supported normalisation agreements with Israel.
Algerians were most opposed to Israeli relations with only 4 percent in favour, followed by Egypt (5 percent), Jordan (5 percent), Palestine (6 percent), Libya (7 percent), Mauritania (8 percent), Tunisia (11 percent), Iraq (14 percent) and Lebanon (17 percent).
Roughly one in three Moroccans (31 percent) and 39 percent of Sudanese were in favour of normalisation with Israel.

A rhythmic beep accompanies the mechanical ventilator as it breathes oxygen into a premature baby's lungs. The thin tube stretching from an oxygen tank pumps life into her fragile body, as a monitor tracks the feeble thump of her heart.
Talia was born on October 6, one day before the outbreak of Israel's latest war on the Gaza Strip, following a Hamas attack on southern Israel.Her skin has since lost the bluish tinge that had raised alarm among medics at the Nasser Medical Hospital in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, but her lungs are not strong enough yet to function on their own.
Hospitals across the Palestinian enclave warn that   amid Israel's  . Once the generators stop, newborn babies dependent on electric incubators for survival could die within minutes. Already, the fuel shortage has forced Gaza's   to shut down.
'There is great fear and anxiety for the lives that would be lost,' Asaad al-Nawajha, a paediatric and neonatal specialist at Nasser told Al Jazeera. 'We continuously appeal to provide the necessary fuel to operate the hospital's generators and ensure the safety of children, the sick and the injured in Gaza.'
The hospital's neonatal emergency unit houses 10 children, some born up to four weeks earlier than their expected due date. The Gaza health ministry   that 130 newborn babies are currently dependent on incubators across the strip.
Samar Awad, Talia's 25-year-old mother, said the baby girl was the child she 'had dreamed of,' but that giving birth to her had been far from idyllic.
'The doctor told me that there was water in her lungs and that she needed to be monitored, so I've been sleeping with her in the nursery,' Awad said. She has not been able to take her daughter home.
The Gaza Strip has been under relentless bombardment since October 7, when Hamas staged a   on southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people. Israel's bombs have since killed more than 8,700 Palestinians in Gaza, including more than 3,000 children.
Since the Israeli government issued an   the northern part of the enclave, the southern districts of Khan Younis and Rafah have been flooded with internally displaced families.
Air strikes have been continuing in the southern Strip despite Israel's relocation order. Alongside the gut-wrenching fear that a bomb might kill her husband and three-year-old son as they huddle with relatives in Khan Younis, Awad is gripped by the anxiety that the machine that keeps her baby alive might go silent.
'I'm terrified the hospital will run out of fuel,' she said. 'I want this war to end, and for my daughter to be home with her brother and her father, who miss her very much.'

The United Nations' sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA, estimated that 50,000 pregnant women have been caught up in the conflict in Gaza, with more than 160 deliveries every day.
About 15 percent of births are forecast to result in complications. 'These women need to have access to emergency obstetric care, and that becomes even more challenging with trauma cases coming in and the health system being on its knees,' Dominic Allen, the UNFPA representative for the State of Palestine, told Al Jazeera.
As part of the UN, the UNFPA has been calling for an immediate  . 'There needs to be a space and time to ease the human suffering that we are witnessing in Gaza,' Allen said. 'Humanitarian aid and supplies must be allowed through.'
At least one-third of hospitals in Gaza — 12 out of 35 — and nearly two-thirds of primary healthcare clinics — 46 out of 72 — have shut down since the start of hostilities due to damage or lack of fuel, increasing the pressure on the remaining health facilities that are still operational, the UN has found.
Israel has allowed a few aid trucks in via the Rafah land crossing with Egypt in recent days. But it has barred the entry of  . It classes diesel as a   that can be used for military as well as civilian purposes — even though Israel closely monitors all fuel that enters the Gaza Strip, all the way to the final delivery point.
At al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, the largest medical compound in the Palestinian enclave, medical staff have described working conditions as 'catastrophic'.
'We lack basic necessities for life and are struggling with a severe water shortage,' Nasser Fouad Bulbul, head of the premature and neonatal care departments, said.
As fuel runs out, desalination plants have also shut, leaving hospitals largely unable to ensure the most basic hygiene norms. The UN says that only three litres of water a day are currently available per person in Gaza for basic health requirements including drinking, washing, cooking and flushing the toilet – far lower than the recommended minimum daily amount of 50 litres.
According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Gaza's water facilities are currently pumping five percent of their pre-war daily output, with infant deaths to dehydration a growing threat.
As resources dwindle, the needs are greater than ever. Bulbul said he had noticed an increase in premature births in recent weeks, which he attributed to 'fear and terror'.
'We do not know what to do as we are facing a severe shortage of medical supplies, ventilators and essential life-saving medicines,' he added.
Yasmine Ahmed, a midwife at al-Shifa, said most of the babies at the hospital were the only survivors from their families. 'There is no one to take care of them and there is the threat that the electricity could cut out, so they would [also] lose their lives,' she said.
For parents who long to hold their newborns in their arms, every day is filled with nerve-racking uncertainty. Lina Rabie, a 27-year-old mother from Khan Younis, struggled for years to conceive a child. Her son was finally born a week before the war began.
'He was born on the first week of the eighth month [of gestation] and doctors told me his life was in danger,' Rabie told Al Jazeera. Marwan, who takes his name from his paternal grandfather, has since been placed in an incubator at the Nasser hospital.
'Every second the war continues, my heart burns with fear for my child and for all children,' Rabie said. 'I hope the war will end and my son will recover, then I'll be able to hug him any time I want.'

Will the Israel-Hamas war upend China's Middle East ambitions?

Earlier this year, China helped broker a   to normalise relations after a seven-year diplomatic rift.
As a key economic partner of many Middle East countries and buyer of both Saudi and Iranian oil, it seemed Beijing had the economic leverage and goodwill to play a mediator in future conflicts.
It even offered to mediate between Israel and Palestine for peace negotiations, and hosted Palestinian Authority President   and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in May on separate visits at the same time. Beijing appeared to be poised to offer itself as a counterpoint to the United States, whose historical baggage in the region and close ties to Israel could get in the way of its role as peacemaker. China, by contrast, has a long policy of non-interference with its diplomatic partners.
Less than six months later, Israel's war on Gaza after the October 7 Hamas attacks on southern Israel is posing a challenge to Beijing's ambitions as a major player in the Middle East, say analysts.
Beijing has interests on both sides of the conflict. It has long advocated for a two-state solution and even armed the Palestinian Liberation Organization in the 1960s and 1970s. Yet today, Beijing is also Israel's second-largest trading partner.
On Friday,   to vote in support of a non-binding United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a humanitarian truce.
Still, for the most part, Beijing has largely stayed on the sidelines of the conflict so far, avoiding the same prominent role it played in bringing about the Saudi-Iran detente.
What has China said about the Israel-Hamas war?
China has towed a neutral line since the war began and continues to call for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
On October 8, the day after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, China's foreign ministry called for a de-escalation in hostilities and for 'relevant parties to remain calm, exercise restraint and immediately end the hostilities to protect civilians and avoid further deterioration of the situation'.
It also repeated Beijing's position that the only long-term solution to the conflict is the creation ofan independent Palestinian state. Since then, its official comments have been largely the same, with diplomat   calling for an 'immediateceasefire and an end to thefighting as quickly as possible' at the Cairo Peace Summit this week.
Critics have called China's position either too ' bland ' or its response too late – Beijing took a day to issue a formal statement. But Benjamin Ho Tze Ern, an assistant professor at the Singapore-based S Rajaratnam School of International Studies' China programme, said this was a pragmatic choice.
Beijing wanted to 'see how other countries respond first so as to proffer it with the moral high ground of taking a more 'neutral' approach,' he said. 'Given the fog of war, it does not want to make any clear statements which it may have to retract in the event the information is incorrect.'

Why has China stayed neutral?
Beijing has remained neutral because such a position is in its long-term regional interest in to not take sides, said Yun Sun, Director of the China programme at the Washington-based Stimson Center.
'If China wants to appear as a different great power projecting a different future of reconciliation, it cannot pick one side against the other. That's why you see statements like China is against all attacks against civilians, which criticise both Hamas and Israel,' she said.
The current conflict is also very different from when they negotiated a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia, a case where both countries wanted a resolution and Oman and Iraq had already laid the groundwork. Hamas and Israel, by contrast, are engaged in a continuing conflict that observers worry could escalate.
Beijing may also recognise that in such a protracted conflict that also draws in other powers, it's simply out of its depth, said Trita Parsi, the co-founder of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
'One has to remember, the Chinese never had the same involvement or knowledge or rapport with different players to be able to play the role that they did play in the Saudi-Iranian equivalent,' he said. 'Essentially, they don't have the same type of luxury of trying to get to know the partners. While you're mediating this, you need to be way ahead of the game and the Chinese simply are not.'
What is at stake for China?
China has strong economic interests in the region and those would be affected if the current war draws in other players. It imports a substantial amount of energy from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. Trade figures are also high at $259bn in 2021  for the Middle East and North Africa – three times the volume of US trade with the region. China's trade with Israel stood at $18bn in 2021 .
Also at stake is Beijing's standing on the global stage, said Steve Tsang, director of theSOASChina Institute. That incentivises China to remain neutral even at risk to its relationship with Israel.
'This is about posturing to the Global South, which is largely more sympathetic to the plights of the Palestinians than to the outrage of Israelis.The object for China is to secure support from the Global South to enable it to 'democratise' the international order,' Tsang told Al Jazeera by email.
'China under Xi is about looking out for its own interest, not in making peace for the global common good,' he said.
How will this affect the US-China rivalry?
While SOAS's Tsang said the current conflict provided another opportunity for China to 'push forward an alternative to the US-dominated liberal international order,' Parsi saw it as a chance to show that the two rivals could work together.
China's top diplomat Wang Yi travelled to the US on Thursday to discuss the war with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in another sign that Beijing is still interested in staying involved. Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to travel to San Francisco in November for the APEC Summit, where he  .
'I think the Chinese see this as a potential opportunity to show the world and show the United States that if China and the United States work together on these issues, better outcomes are achieved for everyone,' Parsi said.
'That's a way for the Chinese to dispel fears on the Western side that the rise of China means that China's seeking to replace the West. Instead, the Chinese are trying to signal that they want to partner with the West on important and tricky issues like this.'

Biden to visit Israel as Gaza faces humanitarian catastrophe

October 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
US President JoeBidenwill make a high-stakes visit to Israel on Wednesday as it prepares to escalate   against Hamas fighters that has set off   in Gaza and raised fears of a broader conflict with Iran.
Biden's visit will mark a significant show of US support for its top Middle East ally after Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel on October 7. Death toll on the Israeli side has reached 1,400 people on Tuesday.
Israel has responded by tightening its blockade on Hamas-ruled Gaza, including by restricting the entry of fuel, and bombarding the area with air raids that have killed more than 2,800 Palestinians and displaced hundreds of thousands more.
Al Jazeera's Safwat Kahlout, reporting from Gaza, said at least 71 people were killed overnight on Tuesday in Israeli bombardments.
"The heaviest bombardments occurred in three areas in the south of Gaza: Khan Younis, Rafah and Deir el-Balah. Many of those killed are families who evacuated from Gaza City and the northern part of the Strip as ordered by Israel," he said.
"Ambulances are transporting the injured to already overcrowded hospitals, and we are told that many people are still trapped in the rubble of the targeted buildings, awaiting rescue," he added.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken concluded hours of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning, saying Biden would visit Israel.
"The president will hear from Israel what it needs to defend its people as we continue to work with Congress to meet those needs," Blinken told reporters.
Biden would meet Netanyahu, reaffirm Washington's commitment to Israel's security, and receive a comprehensive brief on its war aims and strategy, Blinken said.
"[The] president will hear from Israel how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimises civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not benefit Hamas," Blinken added.
Blinken also said he and Netanyahu had agreed to develop a plan to get humanitarian aid to Gaza civilians. He did not provide details.
After visiting Israel, Biden would travel to Jordan to meet King Abdullah, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, US national security spokesperson John Kirby said.
Biden's trip is a rare and risky choice, showing the US backing for Netanyahu as Washington tries to avert a broader regional war involving Iran, Iran's Hezbollah and Syria.
It comes as Israel is preparing a ground offensive in Gaza expected to intensify the enclave's humanitarian crisis.
'Preemptive action'
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told state TV that Israel would not be allowed to act in Gaza without consequences, warning of "preemptive action" by the "resistance front" in the coming hours.
Iran refers to regional countries and forces opposed to Israel and the United States as a resistance front.
"All options are open and we cannot be indifferent to the war crimes committed against the people of Gaza," Amirabdollahian said. "The resistance front is capable of waging a long-term war with the enemy."
Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from southern Lebanon, said Amirabdollahian's statement on Tuesday was seen as the strongest yet.
"He said groups backed by Iran will not allow Israel to do what it wants in Gaza. Among those groups is Lebanon's Hezbollah, which has been engaged with Israel along the border for more than a week now," she said.
Khodr said, "Cross-border exchange of fire has so far been largely limited in scope, confined to the border areas and military targets."
"Hezbollah describes what is taking place along the border as skirmishes and a warning, while Israel describes it as below the level of escalation," she said.
"But what could happen next? This is the question on everybody's mind. People are worrying and bracing for the possibility of this conflict – now confined to the south of the country – to spread elsewhere."
Humanitarian crisis
Japan, the current president of the Group of 7 developed nations, said it was in the final stages of arranginga call with Iran, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said, as she announced $10m in humanitarian aid for Gaza.
Diplomatic efforts have concentrated on getting aid into Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, the sole route that is not controlled by Israel. Cairo said the Rafah crossing was not officially closed but was inoperable due to Israeli raids on the Gaza side.
On the military front, the US hasdeployed two aircraft carriersand their supporting ships to the eastern Mediterranean since the attacks on Israel. The ships were meant as a deterrent to ensure the conflict did not spread, US officials said.
The top US general overseeing American forces in the Middle East, Central Command chief Michael "Erik" Kurilla, made an unannounced trip to Israel on Tuesday, saying he hoped to ensure its military has what it needs.
As Israel masses troops on Gaza's border, it has told more than a million people in the northern half of the enclave to flee to the southern half for their safety, even though Hamas has told them to stay put.
While tens of thousands have fled south, the United Nations says there is no way to move so many people without causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
The UN says a million Palestinians in Gaza have already been driven from their homes. Power is out, water is scarce and fuel for hospital emergency generators is running low.

October 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A few days after Israel's war on the Gaza Strip began, Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari admitted freely that the emphasis of the heavy bombardment of the besieged coastal enclave "is on damage and not accuracy".
A day later, on October 11, the Israeli army boasted that 6,000 bombs weighing a combined 4,000 tonnes had been dropped on Gaza, one of the world's most densely populated regions where 2.2 million people live on a 365sq-km (140sq-mile) strip of land.
That is nearly the equivalent of the bombs dropped on Afghanistan by NATO in one year, according to former United Nations war crimes investigator, Marc Galasco .
People fled, terrified, from the bombs, either because their homes had been hit or because their neighbours were killed in a bombing and they were worried they were next.
In the middle of the bombs raining down on Gaza and people trying to get away from them, the Israeli army issued an ultimatum on October 13: Everyone in northern Gaza was told to move south.
A large movement of people began, in cars, in trucks, and on foot, people were trying to get away, hoping to find safety.
But that very day, convoys of people moving south were bombed, killing at least 70 people and wounding more than 200.

'Yousef was bleeding so much'
The Palestinian health ministry said one Palestinian has been killed in Gaza every five minutes in the current attacks.
At least 45 three-generation families have been killed, wiped from the civil registry, the ministry added.
The air in Gaza, Palestinians have said, is filled with the smell of spent ordnance and the stench of rotting bodies buried under the rubble of bombed homes.
More than 2,700 Palestinians have been killed, and at least 8,700 others injured since October 7.
Most of the eight refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, where more than 1.1 million registered refugees live, have been targeted by Israeli warplanes, massacring entire families.
The camps were more densely populated than usual, as people fled there to stay with friends or relatives, believing that Israel would not target such densely populated areas where refugees lived.
The Jabaliya refugee camp – population 35,000 – has been bombed several times, two of which are now known as the Ternis and Sikka Massacres.
On Monday, at the lively market intersection known as al-Ternis, two Israeli missiles killed dozens of people.
Survivors spoke of limbs flung about and the death toll, according to media, ranged from 60 to 70 people killed .
Iyad Islim had fled his home in Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip and had come to stay with relatives in Jabaliya.
Gaza City [Abdelkarim Hana/Al Jazeera]
"I thought that the camp would be a safer option because it is so full of people, and I thought it wouldn't be targeted by Israeli planes," the 37-year-old told Al Jazeera.
On that Monday, Islim went to the market to buy food and other necessities for his children. He was talking to a friend about the heavy bombardment Beit Hanoun was facing when a huge explosion ripped through the ground.
Thick heavy smoke covered the sky, and the sounds of people screaming filled the air.
"I saw terrifying scenes of dismembered bodies," Islim recalled. "Men, women, and children. I couldn't bear it … I broke down."
The entire camp came running to the market, with screams and shouts rising whenever someone identified the body of their loved ones, some of them collapsing and fainting at the spot.
Rana Rajab was one of those people. She ran from her home searching for her three sons Mohammed, Khaled, and Louay who were in the market at the time of the explosion.
She found Mohammed trying to give first aid to his friend Yousef, who was badly injured.
"I tried to comfort him, but Mohammed kept saying 'Let me go, I want to go with Yousef,'" she said.

"I cried, there was so much blood … Yousef was bleeding so much."
Her other two sons Khaled and Louay, visibly shaken, found Rajab and told her they had seen death.
"I have never felt such intense fear," Raja said. "I didn't expect this bombing. Everyone in the camp is shell-shocked."
On Wednesday, Israel air raids targeted al-Sikka in Jabaliya, killing dozens of people.
"The camp was still reeling from the Ternis massacre," said Ahmad Salem, whose neighbours were all killed in the attack.
"My family is in shock," he said. "We lost our friends, our neighbours, the beautiful memories we shared together."
"They wiped out everything … the buildings are all destroyed. Do the Israelis think all this destruction will displace us again?
"I will never leave my home. My children and I are staying here."
Shati (Beach) refugee camp west of Gaza City, has been targeted by Israeli raids several times, terrifying the 90,000 refugees living on 0.52sq km (0.2sq miles).
Adel Khalaf, 63, was left bewildered by the Israeli planes targeting the camp's mosques, the al-Sousi, al-Gharbi and the Ahmad Yasin.
"These are houses of worship," he said.
"Why were they targeted? This began with Jewish settlers violating Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, and now they are bombing mosques in Gaza."
Al-Karameh Towers in the northern Gaza Strip [Abdelkarim Hana/Al Jazeera]
The mosques stood in the middle of the camp, resulting in a lot of damage to the surrounding homes, which stand closely packed together because of how densely populated the camp is.
"The bombings have terrorised the children," Khalaf said. "We picked up all the burned copies of the Quran off the ground and it was clear that the Israeli objective is causing as much destruction as possible."
Another Shati resident, Saeed Lulu, said, "The attack knocked my wife to the floor from the force of the explosion."
He added that it was painful to see the mosques being bombed.
"Israel has targeted our camp in previous wars," he continued, "but this one is particularly devastating. We all struggle with this psychological trauma, as do our families. But we will persevere and are confident of victory."
The southern Gaza refugee camp of Khan Younis – population 35,000 – has swollen in numbers in recent days as thousands of people streamed in from the north of the Strip.
'My family and I were displaced to relatives' house in the camp," Mohammed Rabie said. "On the fourth night, Wednesday, the house directly across the narrow lane from ours was hit."
Gaza City [Abdelkarim Hana/Al Jazeera]
The bombing was so intense thatthe door to the house Rabie and his extended family were in was welded shut and they could not get out.
"We called our relatives to come rescue us, but they didn't hear us because everyone was screaming that our neighbours, the Abu al-Rish family, were under the rubble of their home. At least seven of them were killed."
Rabie's family finally managed to leave the house after neighbours broke down the door.
"There's more than 40 of us," he said. "We're still in disbelief that we survived this attack. That same night, we divided each other up and stayed with different relatives, so if there was another attack, we wouldn't all be killed."
"The scariest thing is the warplanes returning to target the same place when ambulances and people gather," said Amal Barbakh, another neighbour of the Abu Rish family.
There is no safe place in the Gaza Strip, she said sadly.

Russia blames Ukraine and the West for Dagestan airport unrest

Moscow has blamed "external interference" for provoking unrest that closed an airport in Russia's Muslim-majority Republic of Dagestan, warning that it will not tolerate efforts to "split Russian society".
The Kremlin said on Monday that Ukraine, with which Russia is fighting a bitter war after invading last year, played a "key role" in fomenting an   and subsequent violence at the airport. Russian officials have also inferred Western interference.
Hundreds stormed Dagestan's main airport, ostensibly to protest against the arrival of a flight from Israel amid its war with Gaza, on Sunday.
The crowd broke past security, with some making it on to the Makhachkala airport runway before they were removed by security forces. Twenty people were injured in the melee, including nine police officers, according to Russia's interior ministry. Police have since arrested 60 "active participants in the unrest".
'Outside interference'
Russia's foreign ministry on Monday accused Kyiv of helping to orchestrate the airport turmoil.
"The criminal Kyiv regime played a direct and key role in carrying out the latest destructive act," Russia's foreign affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.
Dagestan's governor Sergei Melikov specifically blamed an influential social media channel he said was run by "traitors" working from Ukraine for fuelling the unrest.
Melikov said the riots were instigated by posts on the social media platform Telegram from the channel Utro Dagestan.
The channel, which has about 60,000 followers, had called for a mass gathering at the airport to stop "undesirable" passengers from entering on a scheduled flight from Israel.
Moscow also accused unnamed foreign actors of inciting the turmoil, saying they had used images of human suffering in Gaza to drum up tensions.
"Yesterday's events at Makhachkala airport are, to a large extent, the result of external interference," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
President Vladimir Putin will meet with Russia's defence minister and spy chiefs to discuss "the West's attempts to use the events in the Middle East to split Russian society," Peskov said.
'Indignation'
An angry crowd emerged at Makhachkala airport Sunday evening after word got out that a Russian Red Wings airline flight from Israel was  , according to local news reports.

Social media videos of the protest showed  a crowd breaking down glass doors and running through the airport, with some chanting anti-Jewish slogans. On the landing field, some were seen waving Palestinian flags and others checking the passports of arriving passengers.
Several local Telegram channels also showed photos and videos of dozens of people waiting outside the airport seemingly to stop cars. Another group was seen trying to topple a patrol truck. One protester could be seen in the videos holding a sign reading: 'Child killers have no place in Dagestan.'
The Israeli passengers were isolated and guarded, according to Israeli media outlets citing Israeli security officials.
Russia's government warned protesters through Telegram 'not to continue illegal acts and not to interfere with the work of airport employees'.
Dagestan's Supreme Mufti Sheikh Akhmad Afandi told residents that although he understands their 'indignation', the issue cannot be resolved this way. He asked residents to not rally but exert 'maximum patience and calm', in a video shared to Telegram.
The incident comes as Israel   inside the Gaza Strip, even as heavy aerial bombardment continues. Officials in Gaza say more than 8,000 Palestinians, including 3,324 children, have been killed since the war began on October 7, when Hamas, the group running the besieged enclave launched a surprise attack inside Israel. That attack killed at least 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals, according to Israeli officials.
In a statement released on Sunday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel 'expects the Russian law enforcement authorities to protect the safety of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they may be and to act resolutely against the rioters and against the wild incitement directed against Jews and Israelis'.
Earlier on Sunday, the RIA Novosti news agency reported that a Jewish centre in the city of Nalchik, in the nearby republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, had been set on fire.

Netanyahu says war entering 'second stage' as troops push into Gaza

October 29th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country's war with Hamas has entered its 'second stage' as Israeli troops and armoured vehicles push into Gaza in an expansion of ground operations.
In a press conference in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, Netanyahu told Israelis to prepare for a "long and hard" offensive, describing the campaign as the country's 'second war of independence' since 1948.
"This is the second stage of the war whose goals are clear – to destroy Hamas's governing and military capabilities and to bring the hostages home," Netanyahu told reporters.
"We are only at the start. We will destroy the enemy above ground and below ground."
Netanyahu's comments came as Gaza continued to be under a near-total communications blackout overnight amid intense Israeli bombardment thought to be aimed at clearing the way for troops to push into the enclave.
Palestinian media outlets on Sunday reported that telephone and internet communications were gradually being restored to the enclave.
Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Khan Younis in Gaza, said on Friday that Israel's bombardment of the enclave had intensified in the eastern and northern areas of the strip.
'These kinds of attacks are giving clear permission to the Israeli ground troops to keep going deeper into the territory,' Abu Azzoum said.
Israeli military officials have confirmed that troops and armoured vehicles have been operating in northern Gaza since Friday but have stopped short of calling the escalation in ground operations an 'invasion'.
Israel's military had until now restricted its ground operations to brief incursions by its forces into the enclave.
Still, the latest escalation did not point to a full-scale invasion after weeks of speculation that Israel would stage an overwhelming show of force after amassing more than 300,000 troops along the border.
The administration of United States President Joe Biden has urged Israel to delay launching a major ground offensive amid concerns about civilian casualties, regional escalation and the safety of captives held by Hamas.
Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said that Israel has signalled that the ground war in Gaza is now under way.
They're fighting there,' he said. 'They're carrying out operations. This is not like the other night where they sent them in and pulled them back. They're there now.'
The escalating campaign in Gaza comes amid growing fears of a humanitarian catastrophe in the enclave amid shortages of food, water and medicines.
Humanitarian organisations have also raised concerns that the lack of communications in the enclave could provide cover for war crimes and other human rights violations.
The United Nations Security Council is expected to meet on Monday to discuss the crisis.
"A humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding in front of our eyes," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Saturday.
Israel's bombardment of Gaza, launched in response to Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israeli communities, has displaced more than 1.4 million people, according to the UN.
Israeli air attacks have killed at least 7,703 Palestinians, including more than 3,500 children, according to authorities in the Hamas-governed enclave.
Hamas's multi-pronged attack on Israel killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials.

Buzzing Tel Aviv's streets empty, as conflict escalates

Tel Aviv, Israel — The party's on hold in a city that prides itself on its vibrant culture and nightlife.
As Israel and Palestinian group Hamas trade blows in the latest chapter of their  , a surreal scene unfolded in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening.
The streets and beaches of the normally buzzing city were empty save for a few bewildered tourists.
A Swiss couple wandered around, confused. 'Is everything closed because it's Saturday, or because it's wartime?' one of them asked.
They wanted to find a spot to grab a quick bite near Jaffa and were not sure why everything was so eerily quiet.
In front of a closed cafe in the south of the city, a few Israelis sat together, smoking.
'I've got to get some air and see people with all this stress,' said one to the other. They did not seem to know each other — they were strangers brought together by a shared anxiety.

Mounting death tolls
Early Saturday morning, Hamas had launched a surprise attack on Israel. Thousands of rockets were launched, triggering sirens as far north as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and dozens of armed fighters entered southern Israel from the besieged Gaza Strip.
So far, at least 70 Israelis have been killed in the attacks by Hamas, which said it has also taken a   into the Gaza Strip.
Israeli forces launched air raids on Gaza, with   so far in the densely populated enclave. Several hundreds have been injured. Israeli bombs targeted two high-rise buildings in Gaza.
The number of Palestinian and Israeli casualties is expected to rise as the fighting continues.

Anxiety, in parks and living rooms
With the uncertainty surrounding the hostage count and casualties in southern Israel, most people in Tel Aviv are staying in their apartments. But some, like the Israelis outside the cafe, were driven outdoors by the stress.
In a small park, others reminisced about the 1973 October War in which Israel had to confront Egypt and Syria, a war whose 50th anniversary was commemorated a day earlier, on October 6.
Indoors, Tel Avivis are glued to their screens, waiting anxiously to hear from relatives and friends to make sure they're safe.
Football games have been cancelled, as was the International Film Festival in the northern city of Haifa, approximately 150km (93 miles) from Gaza.
Meanwhile, the weekly  were paused for the second time since they began in February.

Joy and horror as communications come back on in the Gaza Strip

Gaza Strip – After a day and a half of zero communication with their families in Gaza, many Palestinians took to X, the social media site formally known as Twitter, to express their joy at finally being able to get in touch with their relatives.
"My family is alive!" Hanan Abunasser, who lives in Sweden, posted .
Ramy Abdu, who lives in Switzerland, also posted: "My family is alive. STOP #GAZAGENOCIDE".
In Istanbul, journalist Yasser Ashour, whose entire family lives in Gaza, said : "Hearing from our families and friends in Gaza is like a rebirth."
The Gaza Strip was plunged into a total communications blackout on Friday night – no internet, mobile or landline services – in tandem with what residents said was the most ferocious night of Israeli bombardment and shelling yet.
Many Palestinians were left wondering how they managed to remain alive and some shared photos of themselves to prove that they had survived.
Amjad al-Dirdasawii posted a photo of himself and his three sons and relayed a short conversation between them.
"Is the network back, Dad?!
"It's back, my sweetheart…
"So let's take a picture to reassure them we're OK…
"The 24th dawn of the war…"
-رجعت الشبكة يا بابا ؟!
-رجعت ياقلبي ..

- AMJAD GAZA ‎ (@AlDirdasawii) October 29, 2023
For some of those living in the blockaded territory, limited access to internet and phone lines came with ominous news.
"I am in Al-Shati [Beach] refugee camp in the areas north of Wadi Gaza," said one user called al-Meqdad.
أنا في مخيم الشاطئ بالمناطق الواقعة شمال وادي #غزة .. منذ الساعة 7:00 مساء يوم الجمعة، لم يتوقّف القصف لحظة واحدة. مدفعي وبحري وجوي. ليلة السبت تعرّضنا لأصعب قصف نعيشه، أكثر من 200 غارة خلال نصف ساعة، كنّا متيقنين أننا سنموت خلالها، استيقظنا على استشهاد 45 شخص حولنا.
- Meqdad #غزة (@Almeqdad) October 29, 2023
"Since 7pm on Friday, artillery, naval and aerial bombing has not stopped for a single moment. On Saturday night, we were subjected to the worst bombing we've ever experienced, more than 200 raids within half an hour. We were sure we would die, we woke up to find that 45 people near us had been martyred."
Noor Ashour wrote  that once the internet was back, she was finding out that people she knew had been killed.
"From the moment I connected to the network, every minute we hear the news of a new person being killed," she said. "If only the internet stayed disconnected."
Checking with my family, colleagues, and friends, the massacres carried out yesterday when the internet was completely shut down were horrific.
Israeli attacks flattened hundreds of residential homes, trapping families under rubble with no way of seeking help. pic.twitter.com/WrPsBIwPD1
- Ramy Abdu| رامي عبده (@RamAbdu) October 29, 2023
Another user, Belal Nezar Rayyan, said that his friend from northern Gaza found out that his sister had been killed during the blackout.
"After communications were restored, it was revealed that 17 members of the family had been martyred," he posted .
Isolated and scared
The blackout created a level of fear that made it akin to psychological warfare against the Palestinians.
As the bombardment increased in intensity, residents were left literally and figuratively in the dark, with no idea where explosions were, who had been injured and who had been killed, and very little information about what was happening on the ground.
Furthermore, a limited incursion into the eastern regions of the Gaza Strip shook those living nearby when the death and destruction that had been hidden from the eyes of the world was revealed.
Enas Kamal, 27, was sick with worry over the fate of her sister and her children, who live in the southern city of Khan Younis.
"We were completely isolated from the world, and we couldn't move anywhere because of the continuous bombing," she said. "When the connection was restored again at dawn on Sunday, I called my sister immediately. Hearing her voice was like having my soul returned to me again."
So telecommunication in back to Gaza. And the first news I heard from my family is that the only niece who survived the bombing that killed 20 of my family has just succumbed to her wounds.
Rest in peace habibti Malak. Rest in peace.
حسبنا الله ونعم الوكيل pic.twitter.com/Wu3CZGbbVG
- Ahmed Alnaouq (@AlnaouqA) October 29, 2023
The only limited source of information available to some families was the radio, but that couldn't tell them which areas the Israeli military was targeting or which families were affected.
"Is death and destruction not enough for them?" Salim al-Shennah asked. "Does Israel want to commit more heinous crimes, but in the dark? We've lived through all forms of siege, but cutting off the internet and communication from people was a cruel thing. Thank God it came back to make us feel that we are not alone."
The 48-year-old had been frantic over the fate of his relatives who were stuck in the rubble of their building in Khan Younis after it was targeted in an Israeli air raid.
Unable to make his way to the site because of the heavy bombing, he was relieved to find out on Sunday that his relatives had been rescued.
Saeed al-Qurm and his heavily pregnant wife had left their home in Gaza City's Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood and were staying at the European Hospital in Khan Younis.
"We left because we were scared something would happen to my wife and our unborn child," the 35-year-old said. "But the rest of our family had stayed in Tel al-Hawa."
Al-Qurm couldn't get through to his family, and when he was finally able to talk to them again on Sunday, they told him that they had just been through the two worst days of their lives, but they were all alive.
"Some of the displaced people lost their families during the previous two days, and some of them had their homes destroyed," al-Qurm said.
"We are living through the worst war in the history of our lives."

Analysis: Can the US and Israel stop the Houthis from seizing more ships?

November 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
On Sunday, Houthi fighters   in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen.
The 189-metre-long (620ft-long) Galaxy Leader car carrier, travelling from Turkey to India, was intercepted by small fast boats and boarded by uniformed, armed personnel.
Other people rappelled from a helicopter to the deck, ordering the crew to alter course to the Yemeni port of Hodeida.
No shots were fired, and the seized ship is a civilian vessel sailing between neutral countries, but the incident still has the potential to trigger a serious escalation in the latest Israel-Palestine conflict.
In the worst-case scenario, it could be the first move in drawing the United States and Iran into direct involvement in the war.
Houthi spokesman Yahya Sare'e confirmed that the ship was seized for 'being Israeli-owned' in line with his earlier announcement that the group would 'not hesitate to target any Israeli vessel in the Red Sea or any place we can reach'. Israel has denied any link with the vessel although ownership details in public shipping databases suggest it is owned by one of Israel's richest men.
Most of the Red Sea is wider than 200km (124 miles), but its southern end, the Bab al-Mandeb passage, is a chokepoint less than 20km (12 miles) wide from the Yemeni island of Mayyun across to the coast of Djibouti and Eritrea. Every year, more than 17,000 ships pass through it. That's nearly 50 a day.
Many of them have a legal status like the Galaxy Leader, which flies the flag of the Bahamas, is  , and had a Bulgarian master and a crew from at least five other countries, none of them Israel. In the complex world of shipping, the ownership of a ship is less important than the flag of the vessel, which signifies its country of registration, and its operating company.
The Bahamas offers what is known as a 'flag of convenience'. It's a country with low taxes and less stringent labour policies, which attract operators to register their ships there. The operating company is Japan's Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, known as the NYK Line, which runs 818 ships.
Among almost 1,500 ships transiting the straits every month, there may be scores that could be linked to Israel and that are thus vulnerable to further Houthi hijackings.
Shipping must go on come what may, so will all 'Israel-linked' ships just be left at the mercy of the Houthis?
Probably not, but the options to prevent further hijackings are limited to three: sending armed ships to accompany commercial traffic, destroying or severely limiting the Houthi offensive capacity at sea, and persuading them to refrain from attacking.
For the first option, the question is who could provide armed naval patrols in the Red Sea?
Saudi Arabia and Egypt, countries bordering the Red Sea, have strong and sophisticated navies. But Saudi Arabia is in an  , which they are loathe to disturb. Egypt is trying to remain neutral and would not want to get dragged into tensions with the Houthis either. Israel cannot spare any ships for the task.
The only force left to deal with the Houthi threat would be the United States navy.
Since October 7, the US has deployed many assets to the Middle East, centred around two carrier strike groups (CSGs).The one in the Mediterranean, the CSG 12, is led by the newest and most modern nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford. The CSG 2, currently in the Gulf of Oman, is fronted by the USS Dwight D Eisenhower. Each aircraft carrier is accompanied by a guided missile cruiser, two or three destroyers and a flotilla of auxiliaries, such as tankers, store ships and mobile repair bases.
Each of the two CSGs has a clearly defined task: The CSG 12 is to monitor the wider area of Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq and act against any threats that could escalate the conflict. The CSG 2 is there to watch Iran and act against it if the situation escalates.
The Eisenhower CSG is being kept outside the Strait of Hormuz as a direct message to Iran that the US has no hostile intentions, yet. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made it clear that his country would continue to support Hamas and the Palestinian people but it does not want to go to war itself.
Thus, the CSG 2 is demonstrating a less-than-warlike intention, staying in the Gulf of Oman, from which its aircraft could still reach targets inside Iran if the need arises or it could move into the Gulf in the unlikely case that the US should want to escalate its threat.
Outside of the CSGs, the US navy also has individual ships monitoring Houthi missile launches. On October 19, the USS Carney shot down several Houthi missiles and drones targeting Israel.
With all these assets having specific tasks, American options are limited. The only ships that can be used to escort commercial shipping are those grouped around the amphibious carrier USS Bataan, currently just south of Suez. Moving it south would weaken US potential to respond to any escalation around Gaza.
Which brings us to the second option. The Houthis are known for their readiness to take on even stronger enemies. The US targeting them directly could risk a major escalation. Washington could ask Israel to target Houthi ports with long-range missiles, but even that is risky.
So we come to the third option, de-escalation.
It seems that again Iran is the key. If the taking of the Galaxy Leader was an independent Houthi action not instigated by Tehran , the US could engage in quiet diplomacy to nudge Iran into reigning in its proxy and avoiding new hijackings at sea.
This might be the most realistic way out but only if all parties involved show restraint.
The stakes are high. Another hijacking could have a snowball effect, pulling in other countries more actively into an already devastating conflict and pushing it to the point of no return.

Gaza's food is running out amid Israel's 'war of starvation'

November 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Khan Younis, Gaza Strip – Samar Rabie is wondering how she is going to feed the 15 people living with her. The mother of four has been hosting her husband's friends and their families, who were displaced from Gaza City, in her home in Khan Younis, and is struggling to find  .
'I went to one of the malls to buy some things, but I did not find anything," the 28-year-old says.
The shelves are empty, with no sugar, legumes, cheese or any other kind of dairy products.
"There is only cooking oil," Rabie says, pointing out that the price of food has tripled since the war began. "We are being deprived of many staple foodstuffs, as if everything was arranged so that in addition to not having electricity or water, we would be starved."
Due to the lack of bread, the family and friends have relied on cooking pasta and rice, but supplies of those are drying up rapidly as well.
"I'm just worried about how we will feed each other after two or three days, and what we will live on in these difficult days that are increasingly suffocating us," Rabie says.
'Their farms have been destroyed'
Mahmoud Sharab, also a resident of Khan Younis, says that although he is dismayed by the increasing prices, he doesn't blame grocers for the inflation when it comes to vegetables.
"Their farms have been destroyed by the constant Israeli bombing," the 35-year-old says. "They cannot reach their lands."
Sharab goes out every day to scour the shops and markets for food, hoping at the very least to find canned food and grains.
"I can't find anything," he says. "I've had to ask people if they have extra canned beans or meat so that I can buy them for my family.
'What Israel is doing is a war of starvation for citizens, and this policy is frightening a lot of people including children as well," he said, adding that the deliberate bombing of bakeries has left people queuing for six or seven hours just to obtain a bag of bread.

According to the United Nations, no bakery in the northern Gaza Strip has been active  since November 7 due to the lack of fuel, water and wheat flour and because of structural damage. A total of 11 bakeries in the Gaza Strip have been completely destroyed, while others are unable to operate because of the lack of flour, fuel and electricity.
"There are indications of negative coping mechanisms due to food scarcity, including skipping or reducing meals and using unsafe and unhealthy methods for making fire," a report  by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Wednesday.
"People are reportedly resorting to unconventional eating, such as consuming combinations of raw onion and uncooked eggplant."
Since Israel imposed a total siege on the Gaza Strip on October 7, aid convoys have barely trickled through, meaning they can provide just a "  " of what the 2.3 million people in the territory need, say humanitarian agencies.
Ninety-one trucks carrying aid entered from Egypt on November 14, bringing the total number of trucks entering Gaza since October 21 to just 1,187. Before the war began, an average of 500 trucks would enter the Gaza Strip each day.
Despite a limited amount of fuel being allowed in on Wednesday for the first time since October 7, Israeli authorities said it would be used exclusively for trucks distributing incoming humanitarian aid to shelters, clinics and other beneficiaries.
Any other use, such as for the operation of generators at hospitals or water and sanitation facilities, is banned.
Furthermore, it has become impossible to deliver aid to the north at all, as access has been largely cut off.
Limited food supplies are distributed primarily to displaced people and host families in the southern Gaza Strip, with only flour provided for bakeries in the southern Strip, while any transportation of food to Gaza City and north of it is not allowed by Israel.
According to the advocacy group Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, Israel has sharply escalated a " war of starvation" against civilians in the Gaza Strip as a tool of subjugation as part of its ongoing war.
Before the Israeli war, 70 percent of the Strip's children already suffered from varying health issues including malnutrition, anaemia and weakened immunity. This number has increased to more than 90 percent as a result of Israel's bombardment, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor said.
The report highlighted that Israel has focused attacks on electrical generators and solar energy units on which commercial establishments, restaurants, and civilian institutions depend to maintain the minimum possible level of operation.
It also warned that Israel's attacks included the destruction of the agricultural area east of Gaza, flour silos and fishermen's boats, as well as supply centres for relief organisations, especially the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which provides the majority of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip.

Different ways to die
The hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced and sheltering in UN-run schools and hospitals are dependent on UNRWA aid.
"We depend on aid to feed our children," says Maysara Saad, who was displaced with her nine children from the northern town of Beit Hanoon to a school in Bani Suhaila, east of Khan Younis.
"There is nothing in the shops, and the shelves are empty. We were displaced from our homes in order to protect our children, but we do not want them to die of hunger either."
The 59-year-old said that the townspeople in Bani Suhaila often come to the schools to see whether there is leftover aid for their families.
"Everything is impossible to obtain and, with winter coming, staying warm has also become one of our responsibilities," Saad said.
"It is as if the Israelis are telling us that if we do not die from the bombing, they will make us die of thirst, hunger or cold. This is a very cruel war that has no humanity."

Over 100 incubator babies at risk due to Israel's fuel cuts to Gaza: UN

October 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United Nations says the lives of at least 120 newborn babies in incubators in Gaza's hospitals are at risk as fuel runs out in the Palestinian enclave under renewed Israeli blockade in the wake of the October 7 deadly Hamas attack in Israel.
"We have currently 120 neonates who are in incubators, out of which we have 70 neonates with mechanical ventilation, and of course this is where we are extremely concerned," UNICEF spokesperson Jonathan Crickx said.
About 160 women give birth every day in Gaza, according to the UN Population Fund, which estimates there are 50,000 pregnant women across the territory of 2.3 million people.
The first batch of 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza via Rafah crossing with Egypt on Saturday, but Israel continues to block fuel and electricity supplies critical to running hospitals and support several other essential services.
Since October 7, hospitals have been facing a dire lack of medicines, fuel and water not only for the thousands wounded in more than two weeks of the Israeli bombardment since the Hamas attack but also for routine patients.
Power is one of the main worries for the seven specialist wards across Gaza treating premature babies. These wards help the babies breathe and provide critical support, for example when their organs are not developed enough.
New evacuation orders
Gaza's Health Ministry has said 130 premature babies are in danger due to the lack of fuel.
"If they [babies] are put in mechanical ventilation incubators, by definition, if you cut the electricity, we are worried about their lives," Crickx told the AFP news agency.
Moreover, evacuation orders sent to hospitals in north Gaza in recent days have generated further concern.
Since Saturday, Palestinians in Gaza have said they have begun receiving renewed warnings from Israel's military to move from north Gaza to the south of the Strip, with the added warning that they could be identified as sympathisers with a "terrorist organisation" if they stayed put.
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly known as Twitter, "It is impossible for these overcrowded hospitals to safely evacuate patients."
"They must be allowed to perform their lifesaving functions. They must be protected," he added.
More aid and fuel
UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said the supply of fuelis essential for humanitarian purposes.
Besides the urgent need for fuel, UNICEF's Executive Director Catherine Russell also called for sustained humanitarian access in Gaza.
She noted  that the UN agency was able to send only about 44,000 bottles of drinking water to Gaza through the Rafah crossing and no fuel.
'With one million children in Gaza now facing a critical protection and humanitarian crisis, the delivery of water is a matter of life or death. Every minute counts,' Russell said.
'This first, limited water will save lives, but the needs are immediate and immense - not just for water, but for food, fuel, medicine, and essential goods and services,' Russell added.

Desperate evacuees return to their homes in Gaza City despite Israeli order

Some Gaza residents who began evacuating northern Gaza two days ago, following an Israeli military order, have been returning to their homes in Gaza City due to continued   and unbearable living conditions in the south and central areas of the Gaza Strip.
Maha Hosseini, speaking to Al Jazeera from Zawayda in the central  , where she evacuated, said three families who were sharing the home she is staying in have now returned to Gaza City.
'I'm staying in a house with 70 other people,' she said, using the little charge she had left on her phone after a day with no connection to the outside world.
'We have limited water supply, we don't have electricity, just one hour a day,' she explained.
'Actually this is our greatest fear, that we run out of water. When children ask for water, we just give each of them one sip,' she said, adding that they are trying to make the one water tank they have last for as long as possible, as they don't know if another will be available.
'We have three families that went back home today because even in this area that Israel had deemed safe, we've had many air raids around the house,' Hosseini said.
In the early hours of Friday morning, the Israeli military   the north of the Gaza Strip, including the densely populated Gaza City. The directive applies to almost half of Gaza's 2.3 million residents.
Later that day, thousands of people made their way to southern Gaza in cars, trucks, and even donkey-pulled carts filled with   with them.
But in the south, people found little safety and reported being crammed into the homes of family, friends and even strangers who had opened their doors to the evacuees.
'Without a roof over their heads'
'The most pressing issues are lack of food, [as] the markets are either closed or they do not get replenished with supplies because the demand is very much high [for] water, [for] food,' Hisham Mhanna, a media and communications officer for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza, told Al Jazeera from the south of the besieged enclave.
'There is absolutely no access to fuel in some areas," he said. "Some people do not have any way to relocate or evacuate from their homes. I saw with my bare eyes families, women, children, elderly people walking tens of kilometres trying to reach the safe area as was instructed.
'Many families now are staying in the street, without a roof over their heads, without access to any water, no bathroom, no blankets, no mattresses, no hygiene kits. They are staying in the middle of nowhere, without access to information about what's going to happen and what they should do in case the situation gets worse.'
Aid agencies had warned that such a large-scale movement of people would be impossible without triggering a humanitarian catastrophe.
'People are desperate and emotionally and physically drained,' Amal, who asked that we change her name for safety reasons, told Al Jazeera from Deir al-Balah, where she had fled with her family from Gaza City.
She added that several families had found conditions in Deir al-Balah 'unsanitary, no place to sleep, no electricity and no water: not a life', prompting them to return home.
Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza where she also evacuated with her family, confirmed that 'the bombardment hasn't stopped' and that supplies of water and other essentials were running low in the stores.
Israel has been pounding the Gaza Strip for more than seven days, in retaliation for an attack by  , the Palestinian group that has been ruling the territory since 2007. The group's incursion on October 7 and the fighting that ensued killed at least 1,300 people in Israel, while 2,329 Palestinians have been killed and 9,700 injured by Israeli air strikes on Gaza since then.
Some residents of Gaza City did not evacuate, saying they had nowhere safe to go or were unable to safely make their way to the south. Others were  in air raids while trying to flee.
The United Nations estimates that   in Gaza since the war began.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has strongly condemned Israeli orders to evacuate as many as 22 hospitals in northern Gaza.
'Forcing more than 2,000 patients to relocate to southern Gaza, where health facilities are already running at maximum capacity and unable to absorb a dramatic rise in the number [of] patients, could be tantamount to a death sentence,' a WHO statement  read.
'Nobody wants to leave their homes,' Amal said. 'They left out of fear of what was to come, and also out of hope that the fighting would end.'

'Lifeline for Gaza': Businesses raise concerns after Israel halts exports

Gaza City, Gaza Strip – Business owners in Gaza are concerned about the future of their work after Israel imposed a ban on all exports from the Gaza Strip passing through the Karem Abu Salem crossing.
On Monday, Israeli authorities announced   to Israel after an "alleged attempt to smuggle explosives". Karem Abu Salem is the only crossing Israel allows to be used for commercial shipments.
The move was condemned by Palestinian industrial and economic unions, which warned of potential economic and social consequences.

'Production exceeds local demand'
Walid Ballour, who manages a factory making plastic pipes, told Al Jazeera the decision came as a shock.
'We were loading a car with an order of pipes for Ramallah when the decision came," Ballour said. "We have also three export orders on the schedule supposed to go out tomorrow to the West Bank, but they were stopped because of the decision."
The factory exports about 20 percent of its production – about 10 tonnes of pipes a day – to the occupied West Bank.
Ballour told Al Jazeera that management had to give some of the factory's 30 workers open-ended leave.
"Local demand is light, and we rely mainly on exports to the West Bank," he said.
"We hope that this decision will be reversed and there will be an external intervention to pressure the Israeli side to cancel it."

'A lifeline for Gaza'
Awni Abu Hasira, director of a fish supply company in Gaza and the West Bank, told Al Jazeera that he was surprised by the news.
"As fishmongers, the West Bank is an essential market for us, and this closure will make us incur heavy losses day after day."
On the day of the crossing shutdown, Abu Hasira's company was supposed to export 10 tonnes of fish to the West Bank. Their losses may add up to $500,000.
"We had to sell the fish in the local market at half price.It affected us not only as merchants and businessmen but also as simple fishermen. There are a lot of groups affected."
Abu Hasira pointed out that exporting to the occupied West Bank is a lifeline for Gaza, especially its fishing sector.
"Selling in the local market is very weak due to the deteriorating economic conditions," he said. "My company depends entirely on supplying the Jericho governorate. This decision is a death sentence for my company, which supports 10 homes in Gaza."

'Collective punishment'
The General Federation of Palestinian Industries in Gaza denounced the Israeli decision at a news conference, branding it "collective punishment" that worsens the hardship endured by two million people in Gaza living under an Israeli blockade for 17 years.
Waddah Bseiso, spokesman for the federation, told Al Jazeera this decision will significantly impact Gaza's economy, particularly the industrial sector, in which hundreds of facilities are now in danger of closing because they rely heavily on exports.
Such closures would result in thousands of workers losing their jobs, he said.
Bseiso urged Israel to reverse its decision: "We urgently call for the reopening of the Karem Abu Salem crossing and the removal of sanctions that worsen the plight of the population and hinder the chances for economic development, peace and stability in the Gaza Strip."

October 26th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United Nations Security Council has again failed to take action on the Israel-Hamas conflict despite a deepening humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza.
Russia and China on Wednesday vetoed a United States resolution that called for a humanitarian pause to allow humanitarian aid access, the protection of civilians and a stop to arming Hamas and other armed groups in the Gaza Strip.
A rival text put forward by Moscow then failed to draw sufficient support.
The US had toned down an initial draft released over the weekend after diplomats expressed shock at its failure to recognise the humanitarian crisis and its bold statement that Israel had a right to defend itself.
"We did listen to all of you," US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the 15-member council after the Russian and Chinese veto, which she described as disappointing. "Though today's vote was a setback, we must not be deterred."
Ten members voted for the resolution, while the United Arab Emirates voted no and Brazil and Mozambique abstained.
It was a rare move by the US to suggest Security Council action, but diplomats noted that a humanitarian pause was not the same as a ceasefire, which has been backed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. A pause might last only a matter of hours.
"The draft does not reflect the world's strongest calls for a ceasefire, an end to the fighting, and it does not help resolve the issue," China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun told the council after the vote. "At this moment, ceasefire is not just a diplomatic term. It means the life and death of many civilians."
After the failure of the US resolution, the Security Council voted on a Russian-drafted text that called for a humanitarian ceasefire and withdrawal of Israel's order for civilians in Gaza to relocate south ahead of a ground assault.
It was Russia's second attempt at a resolution but the effort secured only four votes. Its   on October 16 received the support of five council members.
UAE ambassador, Lana Nusseibeh, who backed the Russian resolution, said that the Security Council needed to respond "tangibly" to the dire situation in Gaza.
The elected 10 members of the Security Council now plan to work on a new draft resolution, Malta's UN Ambassador Vanessa Frazier said.
A Brazilian-drafted resolution put forward on October 18 was  , which said it did not do enough to stress Israel's right to self-defence. Russia and the United Kingdom abstained.
"This crisis is also gripped by a growing risk of a regional spillover. This demands our undivided attention," Frazier said. "We have the duty and the obligation to act."
Amid the council deadlock, the 193-member UN General Assembly will vote on Friday on a draft resolution put forward by Arab states and others calling for an immediate ceasefire. No country holds a veto in the General Assembly and while its resolutions are non-binding, they carry political weight.
Israel has said it wants to wipe out Hamas, which controls Gaza, in retaliation for an October 7 attack in which the group killed 1,400 people and took at least 200 captive.
Israel has imposed a siege on Gaza and subjected its 2.3 million people to relentless bombing. Palestinian authorities say more than 6,500 have been killed since the war began.

A romance, a birthplace: Destroyed memories of Gaza's bombed Ahli Hospital

The wing of a medical facility is not where most love stories begin.
But that's why   in Gaza - the oldest one in the besieged enclave - was more than just a hospital, says Hammam Farah.
The facility, with a name that means 'The People's Arab Hospital' in Arabic, is where Farah's lineage came together.
His grandfather, Elias Farah, began working at the hospital when he was just 17.
He started as a server in the cafeteria during the British Mandate of Palestine more than 80 years ago and later became a procurement manager, responsible for buying food, medication and supplies.
One day, he spotted the woman who would soon become Farah's grandmother, known to many as Lady Sura.
Lady Sura was a principal at the nearby Beach B Elementary school in the UNWRA-run Al Shati refugee camp and visited the hospital often.
There, their courtship began.

Ping-pong, dinners and games
Now the hospital stands decimated, the site of carnage following a bombing that killed at least 500 people Tuesday night, its memories and stories perishing.
'The hospital was a community,' Farah told Al Jazeera.
Some 40 years after his grandparents met in its corridors, in 1983, Farah himself was born in that hospital. And so was his sister.
While he has not been able to visit Gaza in 23 years, the psychotherapist now based in Toronto, Canada, cherishes childhood memories from there.
His grandfather often took him to the hospital during his shifts.

'There were children playing about, a ping-pong table, it was a community centre, dinners were held there,' Farah listed nostalgically.
The hospital, founded in 1882 and run by the Anglican Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, also had a church, a tennis court - where Farah's grandfather often played - and a large courtyard.
Now, massacred bodies lay in heaps, the hospital damaged.
'They can smell the burning bodies'
Upon hearing news of the blast, which Israel has blamed on a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, Farah panicked.
He still has family back in Gaza, relatives who have been sheltering in a church in the vicinity of the hospital.
Farah 'freaked out', he said, as he desperately tried to get in touch with them, only calming down when he learned they had not been harmed by the blast.

Still, being so close to the destruction, they have witnessed the carnage, he said.
'They can smell the burning bodies,' Farah said.
His family in the Gaza Strip - aunts, uncles, cousins and other distant relatives - have been surviving on canned tuna and dried pasta, as food and other supplies are fast running out, with Israeli forces preventing humanitarian aid from coming in.
A day earlier, Farah's mother spoke to one of his aunts there.
'She's not normal,' his mom told him.
All of his relatives' homes were destroyed in the near-two weeks of Israeli bombardment. Now he and his mother are contemplating how they may relocate their family once - and if - they are able to leave Gaza.
Since Israel retaliated for Hamas's attack 13 days ago, the mental health professional has been unable to do much else besides work.
'My eyes are glued to my phone or TV,' he said, adding that his entire schedule is put on hold as he awaits news from his relatives every day.
'They passed away, one by one'
Farah last visited Gaza in the year 2000, not knowing it would be his last visit. His family lived in the United Arab Emirates for many years and would make trips there every summer.
He was always bewildered by his relatives' reactions when he and his family would leave at the end of the summer.
'There would be traumatic wailing and crying, as if it would be the last time we saw each other,' Farah said.
In 2000, he was just 17 and thought he would return the following summer like he always did.

But that chance never came.
The blockade Israel imposed on Gaza in 2007 has made it challenging to go back.
Each year since, Farah hoped to visit, especially to see his grandparents, but still that chance never came.
'They started to pass away, one by one,' he said.
Now, his memories of them are forever imprinted in his brain. His grandmother Sura, in particular, continues to profoundly impact Farah's Palestinian identity.
And impactful she was: The school for refugee children she worked at was known as "The School of Lady Sura", he said.
"While others took up arms to resist the Israeli occupation of Gaza after 1967, Lady Sura picked up her principal's yardstick and taught a generation of refugees their basic self-respect," Farah wrote in an Instagram post shortly after her passing in 2019.
In a posthumous address to his grandmother, he wrote: "It will be easier to see you in the afterlife than it has been in Gaza."

US' Blinken urges Israel to stop settler violence in West Bank

November 17th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged Israel to take 'urgent' steps to stop violence being carried out by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
The top US diplomat made the call in a telephone call with Benny Gantz, a centrist opposition leader who joined Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wartime cabinet after Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel.
Blinken 'stressed the urgent need for affirmative steps to de-escalate tensions in the West Bank, including by confronting rising levels of settler extremist violence,' the State Department said in a statement on Thursday.
Blinken also discussed efforts to 'augment and accelerate' the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, secure the release of captives held by Hamas, and prevent the war from widening into a broader conflict, the State Department said.
Israeli settler violence has increased significantly since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, rising from an average of three incidents to seven per day, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OHCA).
Blinken's comments came as Israeli forces carried out fresh raids in the occupied West Bank and continued military operations in and around several of Gaza's major hospitals, which have been forced to suspend operations due to Israeli bombardment and dwindling fuel and medical supplies.
Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on Thursday that Israeli forces stormed the northern city of Jenin, deploying snipers and more than 80 military vehicles and bulldozers in the vicinity of its refugee camp.
In a post on Telegram, the Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing, said it was fighting "alongside all the other resistance groups in the camp" and targeting the Israeli army "with heavy fire and explosive devices".
Several villages surrounding Jenin, including Jalboun, Beit Qad, Faqqua, and Deir Abu Da'if, were also raided, according to Wafa.
In Gaza, Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum said Israel's military had resumed attacks on the Jabalia refugee camp in the north of the enclave, hitting multiple residential houses.
'It's important to mention that Jabalia refugee camp has seen multiple attacks by Israeli occupation forces and hundreds of civilians have been killed in this camp, which is considered to be the most densely populated inside the Gaza Strip,' Abu Azzoum said.
Residents in Jabalia have sought refuge at a United Nations shelter that is close to the Indonesian Hospital, where services have ground to a halt amid Israeli attacks, and staff and patients are running extremely low on food and water.
Israeli forces also continued to occupy the al-Shifa Hospital, the enclave's biggest medical facility, where Israeli officials have claimed to have located weapons and other evidence proving the existence of a Hamas command centre. Hamas and doctors at the hospital have denied Israeli claims that the complex has been used to stage military operations.
'Patients are receiving medical treatment on the ground inside hospitals, and they don't have enough food and water to survive. As well as the severe wounds they have, they also face hunger,' Abu Azzoum said.
'No humanitarian aid has been delivered to hospitals in the north of the Gaza Strip, including at al-Shifa Hospital, which is occupied by Israeli soldiers,' he said.

UN chief Guterres urges ceasefire as Gaza becomes 'graveyard for children'

November 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has strengthened his calls for a ceasefire as Palestinian authorities reported that more than 10,000 people have been killed in   on Gaza.
The secretary-general told reporters on Monday that Gaza was becoming a 'graveyard for  ', with more than 4,100 killed since the fighting began, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave.
'Hundreds of girls and boys are reportedly being killed and injured every day,' he said.
'More journalists have reportedly been killed over a four-week period than in any conflict in at least three decades,' he said. 'More United Nations aid workers have been killed than in any comparable period in the history of our organisation.'
"The unfolding catastrophe makes the need for a humanitarian ceasefire more urgent with every passing hour," Guterres said to reporters at UN headquarters in New York City.
"The parties to the conflict – and, indeed, the international community – face an immediate and fundamental responsibility: to stop this inhuman collective suffering and dramatically expand humanitarian aid to Gaza.'
The remarks are some of the sharpest yet from  , who has previously called for a ceasefire and said on Monday that Israeli strikes have targeted 'hospitals, refugee camps, mosques, churches and UN facilities, including shelters'.
'No one is safe,' he said. Guterres also criticised the Palestinian armed group Hamas for using civilians as 'shields' and continuing to 'launch rockets indiscriminately towards Israel', as he calledfor the release of captives still held in Gaza.
Hamas launched   on southern Israel on October 7 that Israeli authorities said killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and included the killing of women and children.
That attack was  , but Israel's campaign of relentless air strikes on the besieged strip of more than 2.3 million people has also drawn criticism.
Israel has also placed Gaza under a siege, cutting off access to necessities such as fuel, food and electricity, while its bombardment has displaced more than 1.5 million people with few options for seeking refuge.
Guterres said clear violations of   were being committed in the fighting.
With fuel supplies strained by Israel's siege, more than half of Gaza's 35 hospitals have been forced to  while the number of people wounded in the strikes surpasses 25,000.
"The nightmare in Gaza is more than a humanitarian crisis,' Guterres said. 'It is a crisis of humanity."
Guterres also spoke about the need to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying current levels of assistance represent a 'trickle' against an 'ocean of need' and that the Rafah crossing with Egypt does not have the capacity to fill the gap 'alone'.
While Guterres did not mention specifics, Al Jazeera's Diplomatic Editor James Bays said that he may be suggesting other crossings into Gaza currently sealed by Israel, such as Kerem Shalom, also known as Karam Abu Salem, should be opened for aid deliveries.
'It's a hint, but it's not one I've heard him make publicly before that Israel should open Kerem Shalom,' Bays said.
'I'm sure privately, they've been saying that to the Israelis all the way through this. Kerem Shalom is a much bigger [crossing]. It is where most of the trucks used to go in from Israel directly into Gaza, and it's been completely closed since October 7,' he added.

Biden reportedly ignored staff caution on 'beheaded Israeli babies'

November 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
US President Joe Biden reportedly rejected the advice of staff to refrain from repeating unverified reports that Hamas had beheaded babies during its attack on Israel on October 7.
Some White House advisors appealed to the president to "cut a line about Hamas beheading babies because those reports were unverified", according to a report by The Washington Post.
An Israeli news outlet made the original claim, which was picked up by media outlets across the globe. However, no such beheadings have been verified by any Israeli or international source.
Not long after Biden's speech, the White House said in a statement that it had not confirmed the veracity of the reports.
The report published by the newspaper on Sunday gave accounts of divisions 'to some degree' inside the White House between Biden's senior longtime aides and an array of younger staffers over the handling of the  .
According to the report, as Biden prepared his major pro-Israel October 10 address, Vice President Kamala Harris suggested that he should add a line denouncing Islamophobia to the speech, two White House officials told The Washington Post.
'Harris cited the way Islamophobia had dogged the Muslim and Arab communities for years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Biden took the suggestion,' the report said, quoting two White House officials.
'But he rejected others, for instance dismissing the recommendation of some staffers that he cut a line about Hamas beheading babies because those reports were unverified,' the newspaper added.
'Wrestling with emotions'
According to the report, Biden at times seemed to wrestle with his own emotions on the war when he voiced scepticism on October 25 about the Gaza death toll provided by the health ministry there.
The following day, Biden met with five prominent Muslim Americans, who protested what they saw as his insensitivity to the civilians who were dying.
The report said, quoting two people familiar with the meeting, that Biden appeared to be affected by their account.
'I'm sorry. I'm disappointed in myself I will do better,' he reportedly told the group.
Meanwhile, two Jewish administration officials told the newspaper there was "widespread support internally for Biden's response and his efforts to address" anti-semitism.
The report comes as Biden   his hope that a   between Israel and Hamas could continue as long as Israeli captives were being released.
Hamas has released a total of 58 captives, including 39 to Israel, in the last three days amid a four-day truce deal, after seven weeks of fighting in Gaza.
Israel released 117 Palestinian prisoners during the same period.
The truce deal was agreed last week, halting   since Hamas's October 7 attack, which, Israel says, killed 1,200 people as the group took about 240 captives back into Gaza.
In response to that attack, Israel launched an air and ground offensive in the enclave, killing over 15,000 Palestinians, health authorities in Gaza say.
The Israeli attacks also displaced hundreds of thousands of others.

Russia says Israeli bombardment of Gaza is against international law

October 28th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel's bombardment of Gaza runs counter to international law and risks creating a catastrophe that could last decades, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said.
Lavrov made the comments, some of Moscow's most critical of Israel yet, in an interview with the Belarusian state news agency Belta, which released them on Saturday.
"While we condemn terrorism, we categorically disagree that you can respond to terrorism by violating the norms of international humanitarian law, including indiscriminately using force against targets where civilians are known to be present, including hostages that have been taken," he said.
It was impossible, he added, to destroy Hamas – as Israel has pledged to do – without destroying Gaza along with most of its civilian population.
"If Gaza is destroyed and two million inhabitants are expelled, as some politicians in Israel and abroad propose, this will create a catastrophe for many decades, if not centuries," warned Lavrov.
"It is necessary to stop, and to announce humanitarian programmes to save the population under blockade."
As Israel   its military operation into Gaza, the international community has called for a humanitarian   to bring aid to civilians.
Meanwhile, Hamas on Saturday was trying to locate eight Russian-Israeli dual citizens who are among the dozens of hostages it took during its attack on Israel three weeks ago, Russian news agencies reported, citing a Hamas member.
Moscow had given Hamas a list of names and requested that they be freed. "We are very attentive to this list and we will handle it carefully because we look at Russia as our closest friend," Russian news agency RIA quoted senior Hamas representative Moussa Abu Marzook as saying.
"Now, we are looking for those people. It's difficult, but we are looking. And as soon as we find them, we will release them. Despite the difficulties due to the current situation."
Israel has said it believes 229 people were taken hostage by Hamas during its October 7 attack, in which more than 1,400 people were also killed. Israel has since relentlessly bombarded Gaza, killing more than 7,300 Palestinians in the strip.
Russia believes it is necessary to maintain contacts with all sides in the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the Kremlin said on Friday, defending its decision to invite a Hamas delegation which included Marzouk to Moscow – a decision which prompted Israeli anger.
Israel had urged Russia on Thursday to expel the visiting Hamas members, calling their invitation to Moscow "deplorable".
Lavrov said Russia was in close contact with Israel, too.
"We remain in full contact with Israel, and our ambassador is regularly in touch with them," said Lavrov.
"We are sending signals about the need to seek a peaceful solution and not to follow through with this announced 'scorched earth' strategy."
Kyiv and the West have accused Russia itself of bombing civilians across Ukraine. Moscow says it does not deliberately target civilians and only aims at military targets.

Israel's war in Gaza could spread beyond Middle East: Russia's Putin

October 26th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has warned that Israel's war in Gaza could spread well beyond the Middle East, saying it was wrong that innocent women, children and old people in the Palestinian enclave are being punished for other people's crimes.
"Our task today, our main task, is to stop the bloodshed and violence," Putin said at a Kremlin meeting with Russian religious leaders of different faiths on Wednesday, according to a Kremlin transcript.
The Russian president, who has been leading an all-out war in neighbouring Ukraine since February last year, said he told other world leaders in phone calls that if Israel's military campaign in Gaza did not stop, there was a risk of a much wider conflagration.
"Further escalation of the crisis is fraught with grave and extremely dangerous and destructive consequences. And not only for the Middle East region. It could spill over far beyond the borders of the Middle East," he added.
In remarks that criticised the West, he said certain unnamed forces were seeking to provoke further escalation and to draw as many other countries and peoples into the conflict as possible.
The aim, he said, was to "launch a real wave of chaos and mutual hatred not only in the Middle East but also far beyond its borders. For this purpose, among other things, they are trying to play on the national and religious feelings of millions of people."
Also on Wednesday, Russia and China   a United States-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a 'humanitarian pause' to allow aid access, the protection of civilians and a stop to arming Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, and other armed groups in the enclave.
Diplomats have noted that a humanitarian pause is not the same as a ceasefire, which has been backed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. A pause might last only a matter of hours.
Russia made a rival proposal that advocated a wider ceasefire, but failed to win the minimum number of votes. Israel has resisted both a ceasefire and a pause.
Overnight on Wednesday, the Israeli army launched a targeted   into Gaza as part of 'preparations for the next stages of combat', which is widely expected to be a full-scale ground assault.
Israeli air raids on Gaza have already killed more than 6,500 people in nearly three weeks, since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel which killed at least 1,400 people in Israel.
On Wednesday, Putin conveyed his condolences to the families of Israelis and citizens of other countries who were killed or wounded by Hamas.
He said Moscow continued to advocate for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli issue, something he said was the only way to reach a long-term settlement.
He made it clear though that he thought Israel was wrong to keep bombing Gaza in retaliation for the attack on Israeli citizens by Hamas.
"It is also clear to us that innocent people should not be held responsible for crimes committed by others," said Putin.
"The fight against terrorism cannot be conducted according to the notorious principle of collective responsibility when old people, women, children, entire families and hundreds of thousands of people are left without shelter, food, water, electricity and medical care."

No painkillers, water, food shortages: What to know about Gaza situation

The Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip has turned a large part of the besieged Palestinian enclave into a pile of rubble, with people in desperate need of water and other basic necessities amid a total blockade of the enclave.
People have been forced to dig wells near the sea to fetch water as Gaza – home to 2.3 million people – is facing a shortage of water as well as food. Generators are powering hospitals after Israel cut electricity following the Hamas attack that killed 1,400 Israelis. The hospitals have few hours of fuel left.
"Food is running out, warehouses are all empty. In the few supermarkets that are open, most of the shelves are bare. There is also a shortage of water," said Al Jazeera's Safwat Kahlout from Gaza.
Here's what's to know about the current   for medical care, food and water in Gaza:
Medical care
In a press conference on Tuesday, Juliette Touma, director of communications at the United Nations Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) said five trucks of fuel the organisation had in Gaza were sent to various health facilities.
Despite telling people to head south for safety, overnight Israeli bombardments in Gaza's south have killed 71 people and injured many, sending another stream of patients to overworked medical teams that are lacking essential supplies.
'There are around 2,000 patients served by 21 hospitals in north Gaza, and we better keep them there, otherwise if we move them it means that we are issuing a death certificate for them,' said Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean.
Blood banks have only two weeks' worth of supply left, said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO in Occupied Palestine Representative
Painkillers have run out. Staff from Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) have reported that wounded and sick patients are screaming in pain while they also face the looming threat of bombardment.
Essential services such as dialysis have been discontinued.
With some hospitals destroyed by the bombardment, and others being ordered to evacuate or running out of power, 20 of 23 governmental hospitals are partially operational and are treating an average of 1,000 patients a day – well above their capacity, according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA.
Water
In eastern Khan Younis, the water supply was resumed by Israel but has had little effect. A lack of fuel and damaged pipelines have made it difficult to transport and pump the water.
The UN also said that parts of southern Gaza received water for only three hours on Tuesday, which only 14 percent of the population in the Strip benefitted from.
Water consumption across all sources has dipped to three litres for each person per day, according to OCHA, which is increasingly concerned of dehydration.
The primary suppliers of water are unregulated, private vendors running small desalination and purification plants on solar energy. This also comes at a cost to a population that is already mostly below the poverty line.
Some people's desperate search for drinking water has also led them to begin digging wells near the sea or to consume tap water from Gaza's only aquifer, which is contaminated with sewage and seawater, according to Reuters.
'Concerns over dehydration and waterborne diseases are high given the collapse of water and sanitation services, including today's shutdown of Gaza's last functioning seawater desalination plant,' the UNRWA said in a statement on Tuesday.
The electricity blackout and Israeli air strikes have affected what used to be Gaza's drinking water sources – one desalination plant that shut down, six water wells, three water pumping stations, and one water reservoir – which collectively served more than 1,100,000 people.
Food
Residents in Gaza are mainly eating bread, but wheat flour available on the Strip is expected to be depleted in less than a week, according to OCHA.
Local bakeries are unable to operate due to a shortage of essential ingredients.
Only one of five flour mills is functioning due to a lack of fuel and electricity.
People in Gaza are rationing the little food that is available, even eating just one meal a day, with children getting priority.
Although the World Food Programme has distributed some fresh bread to shelters in Gaza, food that can feed 244,000 people is waiting at the Egypt-Gaza Rafah border for passage.
The shelves are emptying. (Again, I refuse to hoard).
The guy said he put almost all his stocks on the shelves.
Not sure how long this will last in a very crowded area that has several UN schools sheltering people who are 'abandoned' by the UN. #Gazagenocide #gazaunderattack pic.twitter.com/sfLBBbx2m8

This was my meal for breakfast. The kids had double the amount. The little food from the remaining shops is running out (I have money to buy but don't want to hoard.).
Water is strictly rationed.
Food is rationed.
Cooking gas is rationed.
We are taking far fewer showers. https://t.co/0BPndmgw6K pic.twitter.com/Pewq70HJ2e

Can Elon Musk's Starlink provide internet service to Gaza?

October 29th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
As Gaza experienced a  , a campaign began trending on social media platforms, calling on billionaire tycoon Elon Musk to power the bombarded enclave with Starlink internet.
The satellite internet venture operated by SpaceX is comprised of a "constellation of thousands of satellites" that orbit very close to Earth at about 550km (340 miles) from the surface, making it easier to provide internet services in rural and isolated regions of the world where the internet terminals and cables aren't strong.
SpaceX CEO Musk initially responded  to a post calling for Starlink support for Gaza, saying that it wasn't clear who had authority for ground links in the besieged enclave and that "no terminals from Gaza have attempted to communicate with our constellation".
After the calls for Musk to support communication in Gaza through Starlink gained momentum, the billionare businessman announced that "Starlink will support connectivity to internationally recognized aid organizations in Gaza."
Can Starlink work in Gaza?
While Starlink's tagline is the promise of "connectivity where you least expect it", Marc Owen Jones, associate professor of Middle East Studies at Hamad Bin Khalifa University based in Doha, is uncertain if it can work in Gaza.
'We've seen 500,000 posts on X saying Starlink should power Gaza. But people don't actually appreciate that 'Starlink for Gaza' is an impossibility,' he told Al Jazeera.
'Starlink terminals or dishes in Gaza would be difficult to smuggle in and distribute at scale. The Israeli government is unlikely to allow legal imports of it," Owen Jones told Al Jazeera.
'But let's say Starlink got in. How will it be powered? There is no fuel in Gaza right now."
The Gaza Strip has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007. Israel controls Gaza's airspace and territorial waters, and regulates all the goods and services that enter and leave through two of Gaza's three border crossing points. The third crossing is controlled by Egypt.
Owen Jones also noted that the Starlink network relies on ground stations that would need approval within Gaza, which he says is unlikely to get under the current situation.
"Owning a Starlink terminal with two-way transmission could endanger Gazans if detected by Israeli authorities," he said, adding that the internet provision would likely meet opposition from the United States and Israel administrations.
(Al Jazeera)
On Saturday, Israel's Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi lashed out at Musk on the social media platform X for considering provision of Starlink to aid organisations in Gaza. Karhi said Israel will cut off any ties with Starlink.
"HAMAS will use it for terrorist activities. There is no doubt about it, we know it, and Musk knows it," Karhi said.
Musk responded by saying that his company is "not so naive" and would do "a security check with both the US and Israeli governments before turning on even a single terminal".
Has Starlink been used in other warzones?
This isn't the first time Musk has been asked to provide Starlink internet services in warzones.
In February 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine, Musk instantly ensured Starlink terminals would be made available to help people and the army in Ukraine after internet services were disrupted due to the war.
But a year into the conflict, concerns over Starlink aiding Russia's military have been raised.
In September, Musk faced criticism from leaders in Ukraine for refusing to have Starlink services in Russian-annexed Crimea.
On the social media platform X, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak also   that Starlink allowed Russian drones to hit Ukrainian cities.
"Sometimes a mistake is much more than just a mistake. By not allowing Ukrainian drones to destroy part of the Russian military (!) fleet via Starlink interference, Elon Musk allowed this fleet to fire Kalibr missiles at Ukrainian cities," Podolyak said on X.
Musk replied by saying he had no choice but to reject an emergency request from Ukraine 'to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol' – a response that has been   by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Meanwhile, despite issues over its use in Crimea, Starlink is still in use on all other fronts in Ukraine.
What are the other means of communication?
After a communications blackout that lasted for almost 36 hours, the Paltel Group, which provides communications services in Gaza, said that telecommunication services are "gradually being restored" in the Gaza Strip.
But with Musk's Starlink proposal for Gaza only seeking to cater to international aid organisations, efforts continue across the globe to ensure that ordinary civilians in Gaza are able to continue communicating with each other in case telecommunication services are disrupted again.
Egypt-based journalist and writer Mirna El Helbawi began a social media campaign of collecting eSims from around the world to help people in Gaza.
An eSim card allows users to activate a mobile network's cellular plans without using a physical SIM card.
"Until we fix the Starlink issue with Egyptian and Palestinian red crescent; If anyone in Gaza, needs an European E-sim to activate their internet connection, let me know," Helbawi said.
Until we fix the starlink issue with Egyptian and Palestinian red crescent; If anyone in Gaza, needs an European E-sim to activate their internet connection, let me know. I have my european followers on instagram who are willing to help. pic.twitter.com/VUn9nryhNf
- Mirna El Helbawi (@Mirna_elhelbawi) October 28, 2023
Since then, El Helbawi expressed on X that she has managed to send free eSims to several journalists, people, and a few doctors in Gaza.
She added that she has now teamed up with telecommunications startup Simly to ensure "everyone gets stable and consistent internet access there [in Gaza]".
Some social media users who have sent eSims to help people in Gaza suggested using applications like Nomad  to purchase eSim cards.
After choosing the "Middle East" mobile data plan on the app and paying for the service provider of choice, people receive a QR code.
The Nomad app has been used to send eSims to people in Gaza. People can choose the network of the SIM card they wish to send [Courtesy of someone who sent a SIM card to people in Gaza]
This code can then be sent to civilians in need in Gaza through organisations or people on the ground who are helping to distribute eSims.
I sent mine to @BasharChaheen  btw https://t.co/RlXlpUnlWq
- Hashashin (@HashashinTag) October 28, 2023
In addition to efforts with eSims and SIM cards, the Qatari telecommunications company Ooredoo Group has also been helping people in the Gaza Strip communicate since 2017 with the launch of Wataniya Mobile.
Can Egypt play a bigger role?
Since the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7, Egypt's role in Gaza has gained importance.
Cairo controls the Rafah border crossing, which has proved as a lifeline for the people in Gaza since last week, when aid trucks were allowed to enter the territory through the crossing. More than 8,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israeli bombings while a total siege means there's not enough food, fuel or water to meet basic needs.
Some on social media have also questioned whether Musk's Starlink could set up terminals at the Rafah crossing so that internet services in Gaza could be supported.
But Owen Jones told Al Jazeera that even if they [Egypt] allowed it or were allowed to set up Starlink terminals, "it would have limited efficacy".
Meanwhile, according to local media reports in Egypt, Vodafone Egypt has announced that mobile communication stations have been prepared to be sent to the border between Egypt and Gaza in order to boost internet and mobile phone networks in Gaza.
All a PR Stunt for Musk?
While international aid organisations have welcomed Musk's proposal to help them with Starlink, questions remain over how it will be installed in an enclave that continues to be bombarded relentlessly and remains under a blockade.
"We could really benefit from Starlink to try getting in touch with our staff and health facilities in Gaza. How can we make it happen?" World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus asked  Musk on X.
SpaceX and Musk haven't yet responded to how installations for aid organisations will begin working.
According to Owen Jones, Musk is wading into uncharted territory.
"I don't think he gets the dominance of Israel's control over the area, the dangers Starlink might put Gazans in," Owen Jones said. "He is doing this to simply look good in light of the campaign for Starlink to be given to Gazans."

EU-US summit to stress unity amid Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars

October 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
US President Joe Biden will host European leaders Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen in the White House at a summit set to deliver a message of unity on conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.
Friday's EU-US summit was initially set to focus on testing trade issues. However, the leaders are expected to stress their strategic partnership against a backdrop of global crises.
As fighting rages on in Ukraine, Israel's war against Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza, threatens to spill over across the Middle East.
Drawing parallels between Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Hamas's assault, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech on Thursday that "these two crises, however different, call on Europe and America to take a stand together" in order to "shelter our democracies".
Washington and Brussels hope to avoid a potential second front in the Israel-Hamas conflict that would see the involvement of the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon – or a regional escalation with unpredictable ramifications.
"It's particularly important that we redouble our efforts on both sides of the Atlantic to ensure that this conflict does not spill outside of its borders," said an EU official on condition of anonymity.
The summit will be an opportunity "to send clear unified messages to all parties in the conflict", the official told reporters.
Security packages to ward off 'annihilation'
The leaders' ability to show strong, ongoing support for Ukraine will be a key issue.
Biden, who has just returned from a  , addressed Americans on Thursday evening in a bid to unite them behind the defence of Israel and Ukraine – and secure the political consensus he needs to fund both causes.
Amid paralysis in Congress, the president   he would lodge an urgent request that the lower house support a security package of up to $100bn for Israel and Ukraine.
'Hamas and Putin represent different threats but they share this in common; they both want to annihilate a neighbouring democracy,' he said.
Hamas fighters stormed into Israel on October 7 and have killed at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians on the first day of the raid, according to Israeli officials.
More than 3,700 Palestinians, mainly civilians, have been killed across the Gaza Strip in Israeli bombardments in retaliation, said the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza.
Sunak tours region
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani agreed in a meeting on Friday on the need to prevent the war from spilling over across the Middle East and to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza.
"They underlined the imperative of avoiding any escalation in the violence across the region and agreed that leaders had a responsibility to do everything possible to prevent it," Sunak's office said in a statement.
"They agreed on the urgent need to get food, water and medicine to civilians who are suffering."
Sunak will travel to Egypt later on Friday to stress "the imperative of avoiding regional escalation and preventing the further unnecessary loss of civilian life," his office said.
On Thursday, the UK premier visited Jerusalem in a show of support for Israel. There he sought to help negotiations on the release of captives held by Hamas and to ease the provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza.
He also met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, during which he encouraged the Saudi Arabian leader to use his country's regional leadership to support stability.

Israel tells citizens to leave Egypt, Jordan 'as soon as possible'

Israel has called on its citizens to immediately leave Egypt and Jordan, and to try and avoid travelling to other regional countries, as tensions flare over its war in Gaza.
"Israel's National Security Council raises its travel warnings for Egypt (including Sinai) and Jordan to level 4 (high threat): recommendation not to travel to these countries and for those staying there to leave … as soon as possible," the country's National Security Council said in a statement on Saturday.
It also raised the threat level for Morocco to a "3" and advised Israelis to avoid non-essential travel.
Local media said the council's announcement was due to fears that Israeli travellers would be targets of those angry at the   that began after a Hamas onslaught on October 7.
Israel is readying for a ground assault on Gaza, after two weeks of aerial attacks on the besieged Strip that have killed more than 4,100 Palestinians. About 1,400 people have also been killed in Israel.
'Due to the continuation of the war, further significant aggravation has been detected in protests against Israel in recent days in various countries of the world, with an emphasis on Arab countries in the Middle East, alongside displays of hostility and violence against Israeli and Jewish symbols,' the statement said.
The notice comes just days after Israel recalled its diplomats from Turkey as a security precaution following an earlier request for its citizens to leave as well.
The statement also recommended Israelis avoid staying in other Arab countries, including Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. And it suggested Israelis also not travel to countries including Malaysia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Maldives.

Internet and phone services are returning to Gaza, following a communications blackout that humanitarian groups had warned could be used as a cover for war crimes.
Paltel Group, which provides communications services in Gaza, said on Sunday that landline, mobile, and internet services were gradually being restored after being disrupted by "ongoing aggression."
"Our technical teams are diligently addressing the damage to the internal network infrastructure under challenging conditions," the telecom said in a statement.
"May God protect you all and our Country."
We are pleased to announce that telecommunication services (landline, mobile, and internet) in Gaza Strip, disrupted on Friday, October 27, 2023, due to the ongoing aggression, are gradually being restored.

Majed Abusalama, an opinion columnist for Al Jazeera, said he was able to reach his mother in Gaza 'and hear her voice'.
'Everyone can reach their families now. No one knows for how long?' he wrote on social media.
Gaza had been under a near-total communications blackout for nearly 36 hours following Israeli strikes late on Friday that Palestinian telecoms providers said had knocked out communications lines and towers.
Rights organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch had warned that the lack of communications in the enclave was hampering efforts to document war crimes and other abuses.
On Saturday, Elon Musk said he would offer his Starlink satellite internet service to "internationally recognised aid organisations" in Gaza, prompting protests by Israel.
"HAMAS will use it for terrorist activities," Israel's communication minister Shlomo Karhi said on X.
"Perhaps Musk would be willing to condition it with the release of our abducted babies, sons, daughters, elderly people. All of them! By then, my office will cut any ties with starlink."

Analysis: The military logic behind Israel's 'total' Gaza siege

October 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Saturday was marked by two bits of at least half-good news: the   with first aid trucks entering Gaza, and the  . These are developments that reflect another key aspect of this latest Middle Eastern conflict: Israel's siege of the Gaza Strip.
Sieges are among the oldest of military operations. The attacker cuts off the communications and supplies of their enemy, hoping that deprivation, disease, and demoralisation will cause the besieged forces, and the civilians blockaded with them, to stop resisting and surrender.
Short of an outright submission, the invader can hope that the defenders' morale and fighting capability will be so eroded by a   that they would eventually succumb to a determined attack.
In the olden days, if civilians were not slaughtered by an invading force, the best they could hope for would be to end up as prisoners, hostages, or slaves. Nowadays, such extreme treatment is considered unacceptable — but civilians invariably suffer, even if they escape with their lives.

The siege itself is always cruel and brutal. It is a tactic intended to keep human beings hungry, thirsty, cold, miserable, and without medication. Unable to maintain hygiene without running water, those inside the blockade will experience  , dysentery, and many other diseases.
As a child, I would laugh at my Balkan grandmother's warning that 'when you grow up you should always keep a bag of flour at home'. Much later I met similar grandmothers who had experienced war and deprivation in countries from Lebanon to Afghanistan and East Timor, and each warned their kin to have a reserve of cereals or pulses. But even those who heeded their grandmothers' advice and were not caught unprepared would see their reserves disappear at an alarming rate. If they had to flee, they lost not only stored food but also their kitchen utensils, stoves, and fuel.
The Gaza Strip has been under  , but at least had sufficient basic necessities. Following the Hamas attack on October 7, Israel terminated all supplies going into Gaza, and cut off water and electricity. Closure of the crossing points prevented aid from reaching the enclave. Israeli aerial bombardment and the order to evacuate the north has added to the desperation of the people of Gaza.
That means that over two million Gazan Palestinians now depend on food aid to survive.
One of the earliest modern sieges was the Berlin blockade of 1948-49. However, some of the harshest happened in the 1990s, in Bosnia and Afghanistan. While the siege of Kabul, far from the eyes of the West, went largely unnoticed, the barbaric, brutal siege of Sarajevo galvanised the world into action — at least from an aid standpoint.
Nobody tried to stand up to the Bosnian Serb aggressors that shelled the capital for four years, killing many more civilians than soldiers, but countries did send food, stoves, sheeting to replace shattered windows, and limited fuel.
On average, humans require approximately 2,200 calories per day. Experts have claimed that for a short time — up to a month, maybe two — a person can survive on 1,200 calories. The inmates of the Auschwitz concentration camps were fed 1,000 calories.
Records showed that Bosnians received an average of 300 grams of food aid per day, and the calorie count was certainly well below basic requirements. Most of those who survived the sniping and bombardment, emerged from the war thin and emaciated.
Humans also need an average of five litres of water per day for drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene. Experts have said that in emergencies 1.5 litres may suffice, with considerable sacrifice.
Bosnia-Herzegovina was able to rely on its abundant rivers and lakes for water. However, arid Gaza has virtually no fresh water.
Counting the most basic needs in food and water, every Gazan needs to be supplied with two kilograms of aid per day. For two million inhabitants that makes 4,000 tonnes per day. A typical truck takes 20 tonnes. Simple maths say that the line of trucks to supply Gaza would on each day be at least four kilometres (2.5 miles) long.
The logistics of providing aid are staggering. To deliver aid, the outside world would need to use a dedicated port where an average of two ships could moor every day. Thankfully, Egypt has such a harbour just 40km (26 miles) from Rafah, in the coastal Sinai city of el-Arish.

Some of the most urgent supplies could be flown in, but aerial supply cannot satisfy all needs. Gaza Airport, in the very south of the strip, was destroyed by Israel in 2001, but two Egyptian airstrips are close enough: al-Gorah and el-Arish.
Large numbers of cargo aircraft could land there but they alone could not be relied on: The Bosnian experience demonstrated that an average air freighter takes 11 tonnes of supplies. At that rate, 360 landings would be required each single day, a very unrealistic prospect.
But before anyone dwells on big data and solving the logistics, Palestinians in Gaza would need to be sure that any aid could be delivered regularly. It does not, yet.

'Terrifying': Hope shrinks for Gaza's dialysis patients at packed hospitals

October 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip – Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, the only hospital still functioning in the central Gaza Strip, reached full capacity days ago. Injured people lie on the hospital floors, medical tents and mattresses holding patients occupy the space outside the building, while dead bodies continue to arrive at the facility.
Thousands of displaced Palestinians have taken refuge here, squeezing themselves in corridors and waiting rooms. Meanwhile, many patients with chronic diseases who were being treated at hospitals in the north of the besieged enclave are now at Al Aqsa Martyrs, having fled their homes after evacuation orders from the Israeli military.
For kidney patients, dialysis treatment is a matter of life and death.
Before the latest Israeli offensive began on October 7, the hospital had 143 patients requiring dialysis. Now, the number of patients has more than doubled to about 300, including 11 children who all have just 24 dialysis machines between them.
Iyad Issa Abu Zaher, the hospital's director general, said the facility is overwhelmed.
"We have resorted to rationing of all resources and medical supplies," he told Al Jazeera. "A kidney dialysis patient now undergoes treatment once or twice a week for an hour or two, but before they used to come in three times a week."

Even before the war, Gaza's health ministry had warned that the lives of 1,100 kidney failure patients, including 38 children, were at risk due to a lack of fuel and an acute shortage of the necessary medical supplies needed for dialysis.
Last month, Alaa Helles, the director of the Hospital Pharmacy Department at Gaza's Ministry of Health, said  the territory's hospitals provided 13,000 dialysis sessions every month.
This requires more than 13,000 filters, 13,000 blood collection tubes and 26,000 blood cannulas per month, but since Israel and Egypt control the territory's border crossings, even before the war patients were often left to wonder whether there would be enough supplies to treat them.
The Gaza Strip has been under an Israeli blockade for 16 years with the movement of goods severely curtailed by Israel and Egypt. The blockade has only tightened since October 7, following an attack by the armed wing of the   in southern Israel. So far, only several dozen aid trucks have been allowed in – a "  " in terms of the aid needed. Before the war, some   entered daily with supplies.
Breaking point
Abu Zaher said the Gaza Strip's healthcare system has reached a breaking point,echoing the health ministry's statement on Tuesday regarding the remaining operating hospitals.
Already, 12 hospitals and 32 health centres have been forced to stop functioning, the ministry statement said. "And we fear that more will stop due to the Israeli targeting and the lack of fuel," it added.
But keeping the doors of the remaining hospitals in the Gaza Strip open does not in itself mean these facilities are able to treat the wounded who flock to them, the statement said, saying that many medicines and medical supplies have already run out in hospitals.

Abu Zaher said that without fuel, patients in operating rooms, intensive care units, babies being kept alive in incubators and others who rely on lifesaving machines are all at risk.
"Patients are stacked outside operating rooms as we don't have enough beds," he said. Meanwhile, others recovering after operations have been moved to the outdoor tents – "a field hospital of sorts," he explained.
But Abu Zaher also stressed that recovery for patients who have been treated is not guaranteed given that the overcrowded environment and lack of medical supplies can lead to serious infections.
"The outbreak of disease is inevitable," he said. "There will be a humanitarian disaster after the war ends."

'Exhausted from this reality'
Manar Shreir from the Zeitoun neighbourhood in Gaza City used to go to the Al-Quds Hospital for kidney dialysis.
She and her family fled the intense Israeli bombardment of the city and made their way to Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, where her sister lives, after the Israeli military ordered   to the south.
The Al-Quds Hospital also received warnings  from the Israeli military to evacuate, indicating that it could be targeted, the Palestinian Red Crescent has said. The hospital's director responded to the Israeli military saying a large-scale evacuation would be possible only if Israel provided buses to transport the 12,000 people taking shelter at Al-Quds - including patients - to the southern Gaza Strip and ensured a safe space for them there. The Israeli official reportedly hung up.
But even those like Shreir, who have managed to make it to the south, face a struggle to get treatment.
"My sister's house [in Deir el-Balah] is close to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, but I still have to queue for hours since the early morning, just waiting [for] my turn," said Shreir as she sits up in a hospital bed with a red blanket around her legs.

Shreir has been on dialysis since 2015, going to the hospital three times a week for four-hour sessions. Now, she is lucky if she can get dialysis twice a week, for up to two and a half hours per session.
"It's a huge difference," she said. "The session is barely enough to get the toxins and accumulated fluids out of my blood. I have to watch what I eat and drink, and I barely let water pass my lips because I don't want to have shortness of breath or swelling."
After her last treatment, Shreir was on her way back to her sister's house when Israeli air attacks hit the street parallel to the one she was on.
"It's terrifying," she said. "Even when you are in the hospital you're scared. Windows have shattered before, the destruction is all around you, not to mention the horrific sound of the bombs. Inside, it's not any better, with bodies of people killed piled up, blood on the floor, people missing limbs.
"We are exhausted from this reality. Enough criminality, enough war."
Gaza hospitals are operating at maximum capacity and the territory's healthcare system has collapsed, says the health ministry [Ashraf Amra/Al Jazeera]
'Not enough'
Hajj Salah al-Din Ahmed Suleiman Abu Iyadeh, 61, a displaced patient from Gaza City receiving dialysis at Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, said that without regular treatment, patients will suffer from severe fatigue and swelling.
"Dialysis that is two and a half hours once or twice a week is not enough," he said.
"These are toxins in the body which can't be allowed to stay. Right now, we are making do, but if this war continues, there will be serious problems due to the capacity and immense pressure the hospital is under."
According to the health ministry, Israeli air attacks have killed   in 18 days, including 2,360 children and 1,292 women. More than 16,000 others have been wounded.
About 1,500 people are trapped under rubble, including 830 children, according to the health ministry.
Before October 7, hospitals in the Gaza Strip provided 13,000 dialysis sessions each month to patients with kidney failure [Ashraf Amra/Al Jazeera]
The Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital alone has received 2,850 injured people and the bodies of almost 1,000 Palestinians, Abu Zaher said.
"Most of the casualties are men, women and children who were killed inside their own homes afteran Israeli air raid targeted their building," he said.
Staff at the hospital work under constant, tremendous pressure due to the overwhelming health situation as well as their personal circumstances.
"Some of our staff have received news that their families were targeted or killed in Israeli air attacks," he said. "No hospital in the world operates like this."

'Horrific scenes' as dozens of bodies found in Israel's Kfar Aza near Gaza

Dozens of bodies of Israeli civilians and Hamas fighters have been found among burned-out houses, scattered furniture and torched cars on the grounds of Kfar Aza in southern Israel, just off the fence with the besieged Gaza Strip.
The Israeli military took the foreign press through the site on Tuesday, as the soldiers went from house to house to take away the dead.
The stench of bodies was heavy in the air as reporters walked the paths of the kibbutz, a farming community of about 400 people located just 2km (about a mile) from Gaza which Israel has been bombarding relentlessly for days in retaliation for the worst attack on its territory in decades.
One soldier shouted: "Tell the world what you saw here."
Reporting from Kfar Aza, Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford said there were "bodies all over the village".
"Lots of civilians, many of [them] still in their homes in which they were killed," he said, adding that the bodies of what looked to be Hamas fighters were also lying on the ground "bloated by the sun".
"The Israeli military are saying that there are a lot of foreign workers they believe were also killed in this attack. Many of the homes are completely destroyed," he said, as he described "utterly horrific" scenes.
"What is so shocking is that people's lives, people's belongings are spread out across their lawns. They have been blown out of their houses by the explosives."

The military said it had not been able to remove the bodies before as they were still fighting gunmen and working through booby traps.
Soldiers were still securing the paths of the kibbutz as bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard in the distance.
Jets could be heard above and smoke could be seen rising from Gaza. Sirens warned of incoming rockets intercepted overhead.
The area was one of the hardest hit when Hamas   on Saturday, sending thousands of rockets and fighters into Israel.
At Kfar Aza,the attackers rammed through the fence, possibly using an earthmover, clearing the way for dozens of other gunmen to enter through the breach, according to the Israeli army.
The Israeli military said   from the Hamas attacks had climbed to 1,200 people, mostly civilians shot dead in their homes, on the streets or at a  . In the kibbutz of Kfar Aza alone, dozens of residents were killed, according to the Israeli forces.

Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza on Wednesday reached at least 950 Palestinians, including 260 children, as Israel continued hammering the besieged and densely populated coastal enclave, razing neighbourhood after neighbourhood.
According to the Gaza-based health ministry, some 5,000 people have also been wounded.
Residents of Kfar Aza were used to tensions and violence involving Palestinians, but chose to live close to the blockaded Gaza Strip.
Some believed they had to maintain an Israeli presence near the coastal enclave, even after Israel withdrew its troops from there in 2005, while others had made their homes there because it was cheaper than elsewhere in Israel.
Reporting on Wednesday, Stratford said the sentiments of locals in the area had changed over the past few days.
"It started with complete and utter shock, then it went to disgust and it is now increasingly going into anger," he said. "Israelis have seen the pictures of elderly and young being kidnapped, and they've seen the bodies," he added.
"Many that we are speaking to are vying for blood and revenge."
Israel on Wednesday pledged to escalate its attacks, with Defence Minister Yoav Gallant telling soldiers near the fence that, "What was in Gaza will no longer be."
"We started the offensive from the air, later on we will also come from the ground. We've been controlling the area since Day 2 and we are on the offensive. It will only intensify."

Fears of war with Israel grow in Lebanon after rockets exchanged

Beirut, Lebanon – In Lebanon, people are no strangers to conflict.
'If there has to be a war, then there will be a war. Do you know how many wars we have been through since I have been alive? We are used to it,' 55-year-old Ahmed Ali told Al Jazeera at a transport hub in Lebanon's capital, Beirut.
In just his lifetime, Lebanon has been through a devastating civil war, a conflict with Israel, internal battles between armed factions and spillover from the war in neighbouring Syria.
But since the Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented operation against Israel on Saturday, residents in Lebanon have looked on with trepidation.
The tiny Levant country of just 6 million people - already reeling from a historic economic meltdown - is on the cusp of conflict following an uptick in cross-border violence with Israel.
On Monday, Israeli shelling   of the  , according to a statement from the Iran-backed organisation. An Israeli deputy commander and two   in southern Lebanon were also killed.
The next day, Hezbollah fired a guided missile at an Israeli military vehicle. Israel retaliated by hitting a Hezbollah observation post that belongs to the mainly Shia armed group.
The escalation in violence has forced hundreds of Lebanese to remain inside their homes or flee towards the southern suburbs of Beirut.
'Most of the neighbours of my relatives have all fled their homes [out of caution],' Zein Abdeen, 21, told Al Jazeera. 'Those with small children left right away, but young men living alone have stayed behind. They are not afraid.'
Another standoff?
In the summer of 2006, Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers with the aim of doing a prisoner swap deal with Israel. However, Israel responded by bombing the home of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, prompting a 34-day war.
The conflict ended in a stalemate and the human cost was steep: about 1,100 Lebanese and 165 Israelis were killed.
The war gave Hezbollah a huge reputation boost across the wider Arab world as it celebrated its ability to withstand a full-throttle Israeli assault.
But faced with an acute financial crisis for years now – about 80 percent of Lebanon's population lives below the poverty line – many fear the country will not be able to recover from another all-out war with Israel.
'Palestinians should be free. They shouldn't be tortured,' said a Christian Lebanese man who identified himself as Abu George. 'But we should support them diplomatically, not militarily.'
After the devastation of Lebanon's infrastructure in the 2006 war, several Gulf states donated large sums of money to repair the country. Saudi Arabia pledged an aid package of $500m and deposited $1bn into Lebanon's central bank.
But with those same Gulf countries having withdrawn much of their support to Lebanon in recent years, angry at Hezbollah's ties to Iran, many Lebanese fear they will not get that level of support again.
'I am scared of the possibility that we will be at war. In the past, there were people to help Lebanon. But now, who is going to help us?' asked Abu George.
Economic woes
Not everyone shares the fear of what a war would bring. Frustration with Lebanon's economic situation has some Lebanese thinking that things cannot get much worse.
In 2021, the World Bank classified Lebanon's economic implosion as one of the worst crises since the 19th century. In June last year, the International Monetary Fund said "vested interests" were behind Lebanon's political class resisting crucial economic reforms.
Since 2019, Lebanon's currency has lost about 98 percent of its value while its gross domestic product (GDP) has contracted by 40 percent.
'Who cares about a war?," said Mohamad Aziz as he waited at a transport hub in Beirut. "We can't afford to live, to eat food or to drink [water].'

'Free world, where are you?' Gaza hospital chief pleads amid Israel attacks

The head of a hospital in the Gaza Strip has issued an emotional appeal calling for an end to Israel's bombardment following an air raid that doctors said killed several infants.
'Look at these children. Who is killing these children,' asked Yousef al-Akkad, director of European Gaza Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, standing behind the bandaged and bloodied bodies of the toddlers.
'Free world, where are you regarding these massacres committed against this bereaved and oppressed people?' al-Akkad continued, in a video released by the besieged enclave's Ministry of Health on Wednesday.
At least nine people were killed, including seven children, in an Israeli air attack that struck the al-Bakri family house south of Khan Younis, Palestinian news agency WAFA said. Many were trapped under the rubble, it added.
The news of the attack spread quickly on social media as images of children's bodies lined up side by side on a hospital stretcher stirred outrage in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
Photographers swarmed the operation room of the European Gaza Hospital as women covered their eyes and doctors wept.
"This is a massacre," al-Akkad said, his voice choking with emotion. "Let the world see, these are just children."
Doctors and residents also confirmed that the children were killed in the attack and said the al-Bakri family was just one of many such cases on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press news agency.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which started a devastating air campaign on Gaza after an October 7 attack of Hamas, the group that rules the enclave, in southern Israel.
So far, at least 1,400 people have been killed in Israel and nearly 3,500 in Gaza, including 1,030 children.

Indonesian staff at Gaza hospital 'resigned to fate' as Israelis close in

November 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Medan, Indonesia – At this time of the year, it should be   in the Gaza Strip.
Instead, the fields traditionally planted with strawberries in September and harvested from November are now battlefields.
One of the most fertile regions for Palestine's renowned strawberries is Beit Lahia, with its good climate, rich soil and high-quality water supplies.
Located in north Gaza, Beit Lahia is also the home of the Indonesian Hospital where medical volunteer from Indonesia Fikri Rofiul Haq is based with the Indonesian humanitarian organisation the Medical Emergency Rescue Committee (MER-C).
'The Israeli forces have been bombing fields across the Gaza Strip and a lot of crops have died", Haq told Al Jazeera.
'This year, there won't be the usual produce like strawberries, even though it is the winter season,' he said.
Amid the horror of Israel's war on Gaza, the destruction of Palestine's strawberry harvest may seem insignificant.
But for Haq – one of three Indonesian MER-C volunteers based at the Indonesian Hospital – the memory of Gaza's strawberries helps him cope. Each day is now a matter of survival in the territory, where Israel is now concentrating its attacks on hospitals.
'At the beginning of the war, we were still able to get some goods from the area around the hospital, like vegetables and instant noodles, but now it is impossible to get fresh produce like onions, tomatoes and cucumbers,' he said, speaking to Al Jazeera through WhatsApp voice messages.
'At the Indonesia Hospital now, staff only get a meal once a day at lunchtime, which is provided by [the neighbouring] Al-Shifa Hospital. For breakfast and dinner, staff eat biscuits or dates,' he said.

Conditions at both the Indonesian and   hospitals, as well as other hospitals in Gaza, have seriously deteriorated since Al Jazeera last spoke to Haq on Friday.
Dr Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa Hospital, warned on Saturday that hundreds of injured people as well as newborn babies needed to be urgently transported to an operational medical facility as his hospital was crumbling under the strain of a lack of fuel and medicine - as well as Israeli bombardments.
'It's a tragedy. The dead bodies - we can't put them in freezers as they're not functioning so we decided to dig a pit in the vicinity of the hospital. It's a very inhumane scene. The situation is totally out of control. Hundreds of bodies are decomposing,' Abu Salmiya told AlJazeera.
Atef al-Kahlot, the director of the Indonesian Hospital, said his facility is operating only at between 30-40 percent of capacity and he made an appeal for the world to help.
'We call on the honourable people of the world, if any of them are left, to put pressure on the occupation forces to supply the Indonesian Hospital and the rest of the hospitals in the Gaza Strip,' he said.
Before the war
Before the war, food supplies for the Indonesian Hospital were usually sourced from nearby areas, Haq said. At the start of Israel's total blockade and attacks on Gaza, MER-C volunteers would go out to hunt for supplies in ambulances, provided by the hospital, which were considered safer than civilian vehicles.
Now the fighting has come so close to the hospital that it is too dangerous to venture outside.
Haq told Al Jazeera that he has been feeling particularly shaken lately, following an excursion about two weeks ago to source medical supplies for the hospital from civilian homes in the surrounding Al-Jalaa district, during which he thought he might die.
He and other volunteers from Indonesia were only about 20 minutes from the hospital when bombs started to fall some 200 metres (218 yards) away.
'I felt the most scared and resigned to my fate then, because we were in buildings owned by locals and, as we know, the Israeli military is destroying civilian homes,' he said.
'There was no guarantee of our safety. It made me feel extraordinary fear but, by the grace of God, we were protected.'
As a result of the trip, Haq was able to find some medical supplies for the hospital and hand out food packets to medical staff.
But since that near-miss with Israeli shells and missiles, he and the other volunteers have stayed within the hospital grounds where they sleep in the doctors' quarters.
'The trauma we experienced was so great but, if we stay on the hospital grounds, I feel safe because the Israeli military has not directly attacked the hospital yet,' he said.
'The area around the hospital is being bombarded constantly and when that happens, I feel a very human fear,' he added.
In the past week, areas around the Indonesian and other hospitals in the Gaza Strip have been the targets of intensifying Israeli bombardments.
Israeli tanks have closed in, encircling the medical facilities where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought shelter as Israel's bombardment flattens entire neighbourhoods in Gaza. More than 11,000 people have now been killed in the territory.
Haq recounts the Israeli bombing being so close that it made the hospital building shake and part of the roof had already collapsed.
'Usually, when there are bombings, the hospital building sways but on November 9, it felt as if the hospital was being lifted up off its foundations,' he said.
'It just made us terrified.'
Treating wounds and documenting tragedy
Haq told Al Jazeera that when the bombing starts, he and the other staff take refuge in the basement of the hospital. Their daily work schedule fluctuates according to the significant needs of staff and patients.
'Some days I work from 11am until 4pm the next day and just sleep a few hours where I can. The other day, I slept from 7am to 8am and then started again,' he said.
In 2011, MER-C organised donations to build the Indonesian Hospital, which was officially inaugurated in 2016 by Indonesia's then-Vice President Jusuf Kalla.
MER-C staff are technically medical humanitarian volunteers. Now, one of their primary roles is to document the sick and injured who come to the hospital and monitor the attacks around the facility.
Haq and his colleagues also assist with medical treatment, particularly as the situation continues to deteriorate and doctors at the hospital are overrun with patients streaming in from surrounding areas.
'On Wednesday last week, when patients rushed to the hospital, we helped treat minor wounds because there were not enough doctors to handle all the patients,' he said.
While Indonesia has been working to evacuate some of its nationals in Gaza, Haq told Al Jazeera that he would not be one of them.
'God willing, me and the two other MER-C volunteers have decided to stay in the Gaza Strip,' he said.
'We really appreciate the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs helping to evacuate Indonesian citizens from Gaza, but that is our decision,' he said about choosing to remain in Gaza.

'Our voices will go on': Dahdouh's Al Jazeera team stands behind him

Members of the Al Jazeera Media Network condemn the killing of their colleague Wael Dahdouh's wife, son, daughter and grandson in the central Gaza Strip.
Members of the Dahdouh and Awad families were hit by Israeli shelling at the home they were staying in at the Nuseirat refugee camp.
Al Jazeera Arabic presenter Tamer Almisshal said the killing of Dahdouh's family members is part of ongoing Israeli targeting of Palestinian journalists, specifically of Dahdouh, Al Jazeera Arabic's Gaza bureau chief, whom Almisshal referred to as the "voice of Gaza".
"Wael Al-Dahdouh is a pillar in the world of journalism and in Gaza. He's covered the Israeli offensives and wars on Gaza for years, the targeting of journalists, and the killing of women and children.
"Wael has continued to report on Israeli atrocities despite the ongoing threats against him and his family, and he's refused to leave Gaza in order to convey to the world what is happening there," Almisshal said.
"His voice will go on – that we can guarantee. All our voices will go on, and we'll continue to cover this assault to get the truth out every day."
Dahdouh's family, who lived in Gaza City, fled Israel's bombardment to stay with relatives in Nuseirat while he stayed behind in Gaza City to continue covering the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
While reporting from Gaza City, Dahdouh was told that an air raid had targeted a building that destroyed his extended family's house.
His wife; son Mahmoud, who was a senior in high school; and his seven-year-old daughter, Sham, were killed. Hours later, it was confirmed that his grandson Adam had died as well.
Other members of his family are still missing.
Speaking from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Al Jazeera's Walid al-Omary described what happened as "beyond comprehension" and part of Israel's "relentless targeting of Palestinians".
"The family had moved to the south of the strip, but that did not keep them safe. The Israeli army targeted them. This is proof that there isn't a single safe zone in Gaza," al-Omary said.
Al Jazeera's Gaza correspondent Youmna Elsayed said it was a "shock that we reporters, who report to the world what's happening around us, have to report the story of our colleagues or of our own families.
'Wael was always a strong man. We all turn to him when we're in tragedy or not feeling safe. He calms everyone, speaks to us like a big brother and not just a bureau chief. He's always there when we need him.'
Despite the loss of his family members, Dahdouh's colleagues said they expect him to continue to report on the ongoing Israeli offensive on Gaza.
"This is a man who has honestly and credibly been reporting from his homeland for so many years. And now it hit him personally. It came home to haunt him, but he's still resilient, and he will continue to be so,' Al Jazeera political analyst Marwan Bishara said.
At least 22 journalists have been killed by Israeli attacks in the war that began on October 7.
ElSayed was on air from Gaza City on October 7 when an Israeli strike hit the building behind her. She was uninjured.
Five days later, two Al Jazeera Arabic reporters were wounded in a strike that killed Reuters journalist Essam Abdullah on the Lebanon-Israel border.
On May 11, 2022, Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh was shot dead by an Israeli soldier while covering a raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.
A UN inquiry found last week that Israeli forces used 'lethal force without justification' and violated her 'right to life'.

More than 70 people have been killed in their homes after Israel conducted air raids on Gaza's Khan Younis, Rafah and Deir el-Balah, according to the besieged Palestinian enclave's Ministry of Health.
The deaths came overnight on Tuesday, about 10 days after Israel started its retaliation against the deadly attacks on southern Israel by Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza.
The violence has killed at least 1,400 people in Israel and more than 2,800 in Gaza since October 7.
Many of those killed in the latest Israeli air raids were those evacuated from Gaza City and the northern part of the Gaza Strip as ordered by Israel, Al Jazeera's Safwat Kahlout reported from Gaza.
'Ambulances are transporting the injured to already overcrowded hospitals, and we are told that many people are still trapped in the rubble of the targeted buildings, awaiting rescue,' he added.
'Targeting children'
Standing in front of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, an employee of the Emergency Medical Services, who held the body of an infant in his arms, told Al Jazeera: 'Israel is targeting children.'
Another person told Al Jazeera that his whole neighbourhood was in ruins.
'We were all asleep and woke up [in the early morning before dawn] to pray. Immediately afterwards, our house with 40 people inside, old and young, was hit," he said.
"Suddenly the entire neighbourhood was in ruins. The scenes I witnessed are indescribable, with bodies all around me,' he added.
Meanwhile, Israel is preparing for a ground offensive.
Al Jazeera's Teresa Bo, reporting from Israel's southern city of Sderot, said the troops continued to move towards the barrier fence with Gaza.
"We have seen armoured vehicles, tanks and lots of soldiers. They're also using vessels from the sea with precision-guided munitions," she said.
"However, right now, the big question is when this [ground invasion] operation will take place."

In a flash, Melissa Joudah lost 60 family members and use of her legs

Deir el-Balah – About 4am one night during the second week of Israel's bombardment of Gaza, Yasmeen Joudah woke up to her mobile phone ringing nonstop.
Astounded, she realised that people were calling to offer their condolences over the killing of her entire family.
Horrified, she ran through the pre-dawn streets to where her parents' home once stood and flung herself on the rubble, scrabbling through the shattered concrete with her bare hands.
The Joudahs had been asleep when an Israeli missile targeted their four-level home, burying dozens of them underneath the rubble.
Yasmeen looked around helplessly as body after body was pulled out from under the rubble.
Then 16-month-old Melissa, her sister's cheerful daughter who had just taken her first steps weeks earlier, was pulled out, completely still and quiet. Everyone assumed she was dead.
Shrapnel from the Israeli air attack had lodged in Melissa's spinal cord, paralysing her from the chest down.
Weeks later, Yasmeen's grief wavers in her voice, her tears spilling down her face.
"Everyone is gone," she said, speaking from inside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. "All five of my siblings were killed. My mother. My two aunts. Their daughters, their sons. My brother-in-law.
"I want them back. Bring them back to me," she sobbed.
From her immediate family, Yasmeen counted 32 members killed, most of them women. Melissa's father, his parents, his sisters and their children were also killed, bringing the total to 68 members of the Joudah family.

Grim future
Melissa desperately needs medical treatment abroad, according to the head of the orthopaedic department at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.
"She has multiple pieces of shrapnel wedged in the T12 vertebra, as well as fractures in her spinal cord," Dr Ayman Harb said, adding: "Unfortunately this means that she cannot use her lower extremities."
"The little girl is physically stable, in the sense that she is paralysed from the chest down," he continued. "But physiotherapy and moral support should be the next step."
Harb pointed out that because shrapnel remains in Melissa's body, she could be at risk of infection and complications, which could in turn lead to multiple organ failure.
"We're working on cases now what we've never seen in our medical textbooks," he said, adding that, so far, he has had 12 patients who were paralysed by Israeli attacks.
Asked about Melissa's chances, Harb was pessimistic.
"Her future will be one of suffering," he said bluntly. "She will spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair."

The hospital, like the rest of the medical facilities still operating in the Gaza Strip, is barely functioning on solar-powered generators and sorely lacks medical supplies and personnel.
Al-Aqsa Martyrs is not a large central hospital like al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, which is currently under attack by the Israeli army. It was built to serve only the town of Deir el-Balah and has only 16 doctors.
Regardless, because of the ongoing offensive, its patient population has swollen, and it has had to treat many times more patients than its capacity.
"We don't have time to cry when we see patients whose lives are ruined," Harb said. "Every day we operate on 30 major cases plus 15 minor ones from 8am until 3am."
'All I have left'
Melissa's mother had been nine months pregnant. The Associated Press reported  that she had gone into labour during the attack and was found dead beneath the rubble, the heads of her lifeless twins emerging from her birth canal.
The Israeli offensive has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, 8,000 of them children and women. Since the Israeli attacks on hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip have intensified, leading to the collapse of services and communications, the death toll was   for on Friday and Saturday.
According to Ismail Thawabta, the director general of the government media office, 11,180 Palestinians, including 4,607 children, have been killed so far.
More than 3,000 people remain under the rubble, including 1,700 children, he added, speaking at a press conference on Sunday.
Melissa, who is now home with her aunt Yasmeen in Deir el-Balah, is waiting to get approval to leave Gaza through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt to get further medical treatment.
"I will put her in my heart," Yasmeen said. "She's all I have left."
She also has one other wish: "I want Melissa to walk. I don't know how she will live."

Team Biden's failure to bring Libya into the Abraham Accords

September 4th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Many analysts doubt that Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah was truly unaware of plans for his foreign minister, Najla al-Mangoush, to meet her Israeli counterpart in Rome, and they instead believe she was thrown under the bus.
Last month,   for talks, and on August 27, Cohen announced the news, fuelling rage in Libya and creating a political crisis for the unelected, interim Tripoli-based government, which is struggling with a lack of public legitimacy.
Israel seemed to be trying to show that normalisation with Arab countries is gaining momentum despite no new states joining   for almost three years. By announcing the meeting, it appeared to say that it is "normal" for high-ranking Arab officials to meet their Israeli counterparts – but the 'Arab Street' did not agree.
Regardless of what Dbeibah knew and when he knew it, his government had to deal with the outcry.
In Libya, especially western Libya, there is no appetite for normalising relations with Israel. Andreas Krieg, associate professor at the Defence Studies Department at King's College London, told Al Jazeera that Libyans have been 'the most passionate about speaking out for Palestine and against Israel'.
During Muammar Gaddafi's 42 years in power, 'Israel was the enemy,' said Federica Saini Fasanotti, senior associate fellow at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies.
'That legacy is still very much present in post-Gaddafi Libya, and I would not underestimate it if I were Dbeibah.'
'It's near impossible to get public support for normalisation with Israel,' Krieg said. 'In Libya, there is this civil society, and this civil society may have been limited under Gaddafi, but that civil society had one rallying point, and that was Palestine. That hasn't really changed.'
US foreign policy implications
Officials in Washington were livid about the leak against the backdrop of quiet efforts by President Joe Biden's administration to bring Libya into the Abraham Accords.
Acting United States Ambassador to Israel Stephanie Hallett met with Cohen to  . One US official said the leak 'killed' the possibility of Libya normalising ties with Israel while making it harder to expand the accords to new Arab Islamic countries.
Libya's Tripoli-based government seemed to have been trying for more US backing and greater legitimacy on the international stage.
'If you don't have public legitimacy, then you can get international legitimacy, and I think the Biden administration has signaled to the Dbeibah government that joining the Abraham Accords might be a way to get international legitimacy and support in Washington,' Krieg said.
'Libya is so desperate that it is ready to please everyone to get some sort of support. If being nice to Israel is going to sway the US, why not?' asked Marco Carnelos, former Italian ambassador to Iraq.
'Libyan politicians do not have any authoritativeness before the international community,' Fasanotti said,'so it is crucial to gain public [backing from] countries that carry weight on the international stage.'
Just as Libya's Tripoli-based government is desperately seeking greater legitimacy in the West, there is desperation in Biden's administration too.
Mindful of how much Team Biden prioritises bringing more nations towards normalising relations with Israel, the White House's fury was predictable. 'I believe that at this stage, Biden's administration would do everything to have [more] Arab countries joining the Abraham Accords,' Carnelos said.
Given Libya's wide-ranging and dire problems, the fact that bringing it into an agreement with Israel is a US priority speaks to the centrality of the Abraham Accords to Washington's policies.
'The problem here is the focus in Washington should be on public legitimacy and preparing elections [in Libya]," Krieg said. "Knowing that this is very difficult, they have empowered Dbeibah and other players in Libya by saying: 'We give backing either way – whether there are elections or not – by you normalising with Israel.' That's the wrong signal.'
'The narratives that come out of this [are] that the US is only concerned about Israel, it doesn't care about the rest of the Arab world, and it definitely doesn't care about Arab public opinion, which is staunchly opposed to normalisation across the board. It also shows that [Biden's] administration are out of touch with realities on the ground in the Middle East.'
Carnelos said Washington's timing is 'completely wrong', considering that 'Israel is ruled by the worst government ever in terms of empathy towards Muslims and Palestinian rights in particular'.
'I have no idea who is the genius in Washington who came forward with such an absurd proposal,' he said.
The UAE's role
The United Arab Emirates was the main Arab state arming renegade General Khalifa Haftar during the 2014-2020 Libyan civil war. He is affiliated with a rival government based in eastern Libya, but Abu Dhabi has recently engaged the Tripoli government with Emirati President Mohammed bin Zayed trying to persuade Dbeibah to normalise, according to Krieg.
The UAE being at the vanguard of regional efforts to get more Arab countries to normalise ties with Israel makes the Gulf state extremely important to US foreign policy interests.
For example, in 2020, shortly before Sudan announced its normalisation with Israel, a meeting was held in Abu Dhabi with Sudan, the UAE and the US. Sudan asked for a broad economic support package, giving the UAE the opportunity to use its financial resources as an incentive for Sudan.
For Abu Dhabi, the expansion of the Abraham Accords is important because it can help solidify its standing in Washington.
Because it is using its leverage to expand the accords, the UAE has been granted a 'degree of freedom of manoeuvre' in Washington, Krieg told Al Jazeera. 'Because every single time someone raises the issue of how the UAE is helping sanctions evasion, financing the Wagner Group or having a Chinese intelligence base in the country – every single time these issues come up, there will be someone in Washington who says: 'Yes, but they have the Abraham Accords,'' Krieg said.
'It's a get-out-of-jail card.'

Yemen's Houthi rebels have launched ballistic missiles on various Israel targets, including in the Red Sea city of Eilat, the group's military spokesperson has said.
The launch came "after 24 hours of another military operation by drones on the same Israeli targets," the spokesperson said on Tuesday.
The Israeli military said that it intercepted a missile near the Red Sea.
Israel said it used its "Arrow" aerial defence system to shoot down a missile on Tuesday after sirens sounded in the port city of Eilat. Israel says that the projectile did not enter its territory, and did not say who shot it.
Earlier, the leader of Yemen's Houthis said that his group would continue to   against Israel.
"Our eyes are open to constantly monitor and search for any Israeli ship in the Red Sea, especially in Bab al-Mandab, and near Yemeni regional waters," Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Iran-backed group, said.
The Houthis have launched several missile and drone   since October 7, when Hamas fighters from the besieged Gaza Strip carried out an attack on southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
Since the Hamas attack, Israel has bombarded Gaza and launched a ground invasion of the territory. More than 11,200 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, including more than 4,600 children, according to Palestinian authorities.
The war in Gaza has sent tensions soaring throughout the region, with international organisations and political leaders warning of a potential   across the region.
The Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has exchanged fire with Israeli forces across the Lebanon-Israel border, and Iran-backed armed groups have targeted   in Syria and Iraq. The United States has   in Syria in response.
The Houthis have emerged as a major player in the Arabian Peninsula, withstanding efforts to dislodge them by a   in Yemen that began in 2015 with the support of the US.
The Saudi bombardment was criticised for contributing to a   in the country and inflicting many civilian casualties, while the Houthis eventually expanded their control over areas of northern Yemen.

The Israeli military has said that a   being held in the besieged Gaza Strip was freed amid ongoing ground operations.
In a brief statement on Monday, Israeli authorities said that a female soldier named Ori Megidish has been released and is doing well.
"Last night, soldier Ori Megidish was released during a ground operation after being kidnapped by Hamas on October 7," the army said in a statement.
"The soldier was medically checked, is doing well, and has met with her family."
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a photo showing Megidish with her family, but the military has not offered details regarding the circumstances of her release. Over the last several days, Israel has stepped up   in Gaza.
In a social media post, Energy Minister Israel Katz congratulated "soldiers and commanders of the IDF [Israeli army] and Shin Bet for the bold operation".
The announcement came hours after Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that governs Gaza,   who remain in captivity in Gaza.
More than 230 people, including Israeli soldiers and civilians as well as foreigners, were   during an October 7 attack on southern Israel by Hamas, according to Israeli authorities. Israel has said that more than 1,400 people were killed in the assault, most of them civilians.
After the attack, Israel launched a devastating bombardment of Gaza and   access to water, food, fuel and electricity for the more than 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip, which Hamas has governed since 2007.
The Israeli   have levelled entire neighbourhoods and killed more than 8,300 people, most of them civilians, according to Gaza's health ministry.
Israeli forces have also   ground operations inside Gaza in the last week.
  temporarily reached Salah al-Din Street on the outskirts of Gaza City on Monday, with a video verified by Al Jazeera showing a tank blowing up a car as it tries to turn around and drive away from the area.
The head of the Hamas government office, Salama Maarouf, said in a statement that Israeli tanks targeted two civilian cars and bulldozed a section of the road 'before the resistance forced them to retreat'.

No place for Gaza residents to flee after Israel declares war, bombs homes

Gaza City – Amer Ashour's pregnant wife started having labour pains just as Israel began to bombard the besieged Gaza Strip on Saturday night.
They rushed to a nearby maternity hospital where the couple was blessed with a baby boy, their second child. But what they did not expect was to return home and find no trace of it except for a pile of rubble and stones.
Israel's forces bombed the 11-storey building the couple lived in, in the Al-Nasr neighbourhood in the west of Gaza City, after the Palestinian   launched an unprecedented attack inside Israel earlier on Saturday.
'What I feared most when the escalation began was that my wife was about to give birth. I was worried how we would get to the hospital in light of the continuous bombing,' Ashour told Al Jazeera. 'But I did not at all expect my house will be bombed and destroyed.'
Israel on Sunday   and approved "significant military steps" after Hamas's surprise attack. The fierce battles that followed have killed more than 1,000 people – including at least 400 in Gaza – and wounded thousands on both sides.
Approximately 80 families inhabited the building in Gaza City Ashour lived in.
'Today, all of us, our children and women, are homeless,' he said as he pulled his belongings from the rubble. 'Where will we go in these difficult times?'
Shadi Al-Hassi and his elder brother fled their home in the east of the Gaza Strip after it was damaged following an air strike on a building behind their house. They went to their parents' apartment in Al-Watan Tower in downtown Gaza City.
'At four o'clock in the morning, I was surprised by calls to us to evacuate the tower, which had been threatened with Israeli bombing,' Al-Hassi told Al Jazeera.
Civil defence vehicles and ambulances rushed to evacuate the building's residents minutes before it was bombed, causing panic among the families that lived there.
'Until this moment, I am still in shock that the tower was targeted. A residential and civilian tower par excellence, with clinics, companies and a beauty centre? Where is the military activity that Israel claims?' Al-Hassi told Al Jazeera.

Youssef Al-Bawab, who lived in a building opposite the Al-Watan Tower, told Al Jazeera they received a warning from Israeli forces at 5pm local time (14:00 GMT) to evacuate their house.
"We felt very frightened. The tower is only a few metres away from us and it is a civilian tower. We did not notice any resistance activities in it as Israel claimed."
The building in which Al-Bawab lived with 150 other people was badly damaged and became uninhabitable. Several other houses and buildings around the Al-Watan Tower were also severely damaged after the bombing.
'Israel says it is targeting resistance fighters, military sites and buildings belonging to Hamas, but the truth is otherwise. I believe Israel is deliberately targeting civilians and displacing them to put more pressure on Hamas," Al-Bawab said. 'But what is our fault? Where do we go?'
Mohammed Salah, from Beit Lahia neighbourhood in the north of Gaza, said he left his home and took shelter in a United Nations-run school with other families from the area.
'Last night, Israeli aeroplanes randomly bombed our area. The situation was very dangerous, so I left my home with other families,' he told Al Jazeera.
'Israeli bombs don't differentiate between civilians and resistance fighters. In every war, we leave our homes because of the indiscriminate bombing.'
'We have been living in this for years, with no one defending or standing for us. We have the right to resist our occupier," Salah said.

IMF could augment Egypt's loan programme over effects of Gaza war

November 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The International Monetary Fund is seeking to increase Egypt's loan programme due to the effects of the war in neighbouring Gaza, according to a Reuters report.
Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told Reuters on Friday that the IMF was "seriously considering" a possible augmentation of Egypt's $3bn loan programme due to economic difficulties posed by the Israel-Gaza war.
Egypt began seeking a new IMF loan after Russia's war in Ukraine pushed up its bills for wheat and oil while dealing a blow to tourism from two of its largest markets, Ukraine and Russia.
In October last year, the IMF agreed to grant Cairo the loan, adding that the loan programme would include "policies to unleash private sector growth including by reducing the state footprint, adopting a more robust competition framework, enhancing transparency, and ensuring improved trade facilitation".
Georgieva's comments came in an interview on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in San Francisco.
She expressed that the war in Gaza is not only "devastating" the besieged Strip's population and economy, but also has "severe impacts" on the West Bank's economy and is also posing difficulties for neighbouring countries like Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan through the loss of tourism and higher energy costs.
At the APEC summit, the 21 members, including the United States, China and Russia, remained divided over the war on Gaza.
A statement issued by this year's APEC chair, the United States, said the leaders exchanged views on the Gaza crisis, with some objecting to the language of the chair's statement in an accompanying "Golden Gate Declaration" covering economic issues "on the basis that they do not believe that APEC is a forum to discuss geopolitical issues".
Some APEC leaders shared the united messages of the November 11 joint   in Riyadh, the chair's statement said.
Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia in a joint statement said they were among the APEC leaders who supported the messages of the Riyadh summit, which had called for an immediate end to military operations in Gaza, rejecting Israel's justification of its actions against Palestinians as self-defence.

'Want to die with my family': From Gaza, stuck in West Bank, fearing arrest

November 4th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Nablus, occupied West Bank — 'I want the war to end and to go back to Gaza,' said Mohammed Abu Seef, a wide-eyed, 11-year-old boy, holding back his tears.
'Please stop this. We are losing our loved ones.'
Mohammed has spent his whole life in the besieged Gaza Strip, barring a trip to the Israeli city of Herzliya to receive medical treatment that has since morphed into a nightmare.
On October 7, an unprecedented attack by Hamas launched on Israeli army outposts and surrounding villages in southern Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,400 people.   — including dual nationals — were taken captive and brought to Gaza. Hamas said its actions were in response to what it described as decades of atrocities committed against Palestinians and their holy sites.
Since then, more than 9,200 people in Gaza, including at least 3,800 children, have been killed by Israeli air strikes and, now, a ground invasion.
But the war has also separated thousands of Palestinian family members from each other, including children like Mohammed, who was forced by Israeli soldiers to cross into the occupied West Bank from Israel, while his family is in Gaza.
The United Nations has estimated that more than 45 percent of homes and a significant proportion of civilian infrastructure in Gaza have been flattened by Israel's indiscriminate bombing.
Two hours after Al Jazeera spoke with him at a temporary camp in the northern West Bank city of Nablus, we were informed that Mohammed's younger brother and sister had been killed in an   on his home in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.
So far, volunteers running the site housing stranded workers from Gaza have been unable to summon the courage to break the news to him.

Uncertain future
Mohammed remains at the temporary encampment at the Nablus Municipal Stadium along with more than 200 other displaced people from Gaza.
But the future of the site – like many in the occupied West Bank – is uncertain. So, too, is the fate of its occupants.
Before October 7, an estimated 18,500 people from Gaza had permits that allowed them to work in Israel. Since then, thousands of them have been arrested, and others have gone missing — human rights groups and labour unions have warned that large numbers of workers may have been taken into Israeli detention camps.
In addition, by October 12, Israel had expelled at least   into the West Bank. Now, regional sources say, more than 5,500 Gaza residents are estimated to have been trapped in the West Bank since October 7
On Friday, Israel   sending workers from Gaza who were in Israel back to the coastal enclave, and to a possible death sentence. The exact number of workers still present in Israel remains unknown.
But volunteers at the Nablus Municipal Stadium confirmed on Friday that none of the people from Gaza sheltering there had been sent back yet.
'I don't think about growing up'
It isn't just workers from Gaza who are stranded in the West Bank, though.
For the past three months, Mohammed has been separated from his family. Initially, he received treatment for a serious arm fracture at a hospital in Herzliya.
But when the war broke out on October 7, soldiers removed him from the hospital and forced him over a dangerous crossing on foot through military checkpoints to the West Bank.
'I was at the hospital, but they kicked me out," Mohammed told us. 'I went to Nazareth until things cooled down so I could go back to the hospital for treatment, but they followed us there and kicked us out as well.
'We started running because if they caught us, they would have kept us as hostages. Thank God I had my cousins with me. But I haven't seen my family for the past three months.
'I miss them so much and I talk with them every day.'
When asked about his hopes for the future, Mohammed said: "I don't think about growing up to be anything.
'I am just thinking about building a new home for my family. I don't want my mother to be forced to move from one house to another any longer."
Mohammed's home and entire neighbourhood at the Jabalia refugee camp, the largest of eight in Gaza, have been decimated during Israel's bombardment of the Hamas-controlled enclave.
His family, he said, is currently staying with an uncle. "But my other uncles went back to God.
'One of my uncles built the building where [the other side of] my family was hiding, but the Israelis bombed it without warning and killed my two uncles and their whole family.'
He played a video of his cousin crying beside the lifeless body of his father, Mohammed's uncle – leaving him the only surviving member of his immediate family.
'I wish he died. I wish he went with his family,' Mohammed said.

A campaign of detentions
After Israeli military raids and scores of arrests at refuge sites in the nearby cities of Hebron and Bethlehem, those sheltering in Nablus are terrified that they, too, could be detained by Israeli forces.
The raids in the West Bank are part of a wider campaign of detentions that has so far seen at least 1,900 Palestinians arrested since the outbreak of the war.
Most of the 425 people sheltering in various sites in Nablus are displaced men who held permits to work outside of Gaza.
Those displaced in Nablus are gripped with fear about the fate of their family members who remain in Gaza.
'My wife is calling me, asking when she and my son are going to die,' said a man who had been working in Israel as a nurse on October 7.
His wife and their young child had been staying with family in Shujaiya, Gaza, before the war broke out. He asked to remain anonymous to prevent reprisals.
'She tells me that if we see each other again, it's a blessing, and if not, that's what God wishes,' he added.
'Nothing breaks your heart more than hearing your wife cry and saying that she's waiting for her death.
'Her mental health is deteriorating. Every time I call her on the phone, she's crying to me and asking what is happening to her.'

'They are all waiting to die'
The volunteers running the the camp in Nablus have told him and other people there that their resources are running out and the camp may not be able to stay open much longer.
'Any second now they [Israeli forces] could detain me,' the man told us. He hadn't committed any crime, he said, but they could still "detain me, torture me or do anything to me".
'For all us workers here in Nablus, we're basically just bodies without souls," he added.'Everybody's just worried about their family, and we are very anxious and stressed.
Back in Shujaiya in Gaza, his family is now living in a house that is sheltering more than 50 people, he said.
'They are all waiting to die.'
He said his father was initially 'adamant' that he and his family would 'die in their own home' after Israeli warnings that bombs were incoming.
But after persuasion by friends and family members, he finally accepted the family would need to move to the house they are now in – just a few hours before their own neighbourhood was flattened.

'I am dead. I have no feelings'
Sulaiman Amad is an academic at An-Najah National University in Nablus who is leading a team of 15 volunteers who are managing the refuge site at the stadium.
'I am dead,' he said. 'I have no feelings. A lot of my friends have been killed by Israel so when you miss or lose your family, you lose your emotions.
Amid mounting arrests by Israeli forces in the West Bank, Sulaiman said he wasn't sure how long the stadium would stay safe as a place of refuge for the workers from Gaza.
'I was told there could be arrests in this building too. I don't know," he said.
But though numbed by the death and destruction swamping Gaza, and increasingly the West Bank, Sulaiman is careful not to do anything that could trigger the workers from Gaza.
'When my daughters come to help, I make them stay in the car, so the workers aren't reminded of their own children.'
A 33-year-old business owner from Khan Younis in Gaza who asked to remain anonymous said: 'I try to call my family 20 to 30 times a day. Yesterday, I tried to call my brother to see if he had been bombed or not.'
He said residents of his family's neighbourhood in northern Gaza had been ordered to move to the south near the Egyptian border. About   in northern Gaza were told near the start of the war that they must move or face heavy bombardment and be treated as Hamas fighters during the long-anticipated Israeli ground invasion.
"My family is living in the school and hospital, in the areas where the Israelis asked us to evacuate,' he said.
'But nowhere is safe. All the places they told them to go were bombed.
'In 2014, Israel bombed my family's house, so I rebuilt it, and now it's been bombed again.
'I am still paying my debts from rebuilding it. Now I will have to suffer again.
'There is no real life – no physical or mental rest.'
'I just want to go back and die with my family'
Just before Al Jazeera left the camp, a quiet, 28-year-old man from Shujaiya spoke with us, also on the condition that he not be named.
After asking about what lies ahead for him, he said: 'There is no future any more. I just want to go back to Gaza and die with my family.
'Are they going to be alive? Am I going to be able to find them? Are we going to be displaced?'
But the man who worked in Israel as a nurse interjected: 'I won't answer like him. I don't want to wait for death.
'I want my son to grow up and become something useful to society. He doesn't deserve to die, he has done nothing.
'He is just like any other child in the world who deserves to live their life to the fullest, so I don't want to die until that happens.'
