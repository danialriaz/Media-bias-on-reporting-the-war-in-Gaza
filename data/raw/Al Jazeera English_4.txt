Biden's outreach to US Arabs and Muslims 'falling flat' amid Gaza war

November 7th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - The front page came with a full-width photo of United States President Joe Biden and a stark message: 'He lost our votes', written in thick red letters.
That was the main headline  for last week's Arab American News, a bilingual weekly publication out of Dearborn, Michigan, catering to the area's large Arabic-speaking population.
But as Biden campaigns for reelection in 2024, the newspaper's headline serves as a bellwether for his prospects among Arab and Muslim American voters — and how his overtures to their communities are being received.
Many Palestinian, Arab and Muslim Americans have   over the Biden administration's "unwavering" support for Israel's war in Gaza. Biden and his top aides have responded with an outreach effort over the last two weeks, in an apparent push to allay some of the outrage.
Those included State Department and White House meetings in late October with Arab and Muslim advocates, as well as the announcement of a first-ever national strategy to combat Islamophobia on November 1.
The US government's rhetoric about the war has also shifted, with more explicit emphasis on protecting civilians and calls for "  " amid the fighting to allow aid into Gaza.
But Palestinian rights advocates say that the Biden administration's charm offensive is falling short.
"They're trying to cover up. That's why we're not buying into this Islamophobia strategy. We're not buying into these meetings," said Abed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC).
"We're past that. We need action. We need this administration to show some leadership and not throw us crumbs. We don't care about a meeting. We really, truly don't. Nothing is coming out of those meetings obviously."
Off-the-record meetings
A survey by the Arab American Institute last month showed   in support for Biden in Arab American communities. Only 17 percent of respondents said they would back the president, down from 59 percent in 2020.
Similarly, an NBC News  survey this week revealed that only 16 percent of Arab and Muslim respondents in the key swing state of Michigan said they would vote for Biden if the elections were held today.
Analysts say several factors contributed to this decline in support. Early in the war, Biden was unequivocal about his "unwavering support" for Israel but said little about the spiralling humanitarian situation in Gaza.
All the while, hepledged increased   support for Israel, asking Congress to provide more than $14bn in additional aid to the US ally as it bombed Gaza. Israel already receives $3.8bn in assistance annually.
Biden further   and progressives when he cast doubt over the death toll in Gaza, saying that he has 'no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using'. That death count has since surpassed 10,000.
But growing reports of domestic Islamophobia prompted a shift in the Biden administration's tone. On October 14, a six-year-old   boy named Wadea Al-Fayoume was stabbed to death near Chicago in a suspected hate crime. His mother was badly injured.
Biden responded to the attack with a public address. "We must, without equivocation, denounce anti-Semitism," he said. "We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia."
Off-the-record meetings with Palestinian and Muslim advocates followed Al-Fayoume's killing.
On October 23, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he met with "representatives of the Arab- and Palestinian-American communities", and a few days later, the White House hosted five Muslim advocates and officials in a meeting that was not publicised by the administration.
Dana El Kurd, a senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC, told Al Jazeera that these outreach efforts appeared "performative" and were "falling flat".
"People are super angry at how the administration has approached all of this. They feel like it's fuelling the flames of ongoing violence," El Kurd said shortly after the meetings.
For her part, Yasmine Taeb, the legislative and political director at MPower Change, a Muslim American advocacy group, said the administration's messages to Muslim and Arab Americans seem designed to address Biden's slipping poll numbers, nothing more.
"I don't see it as being genuine," Taeb said of the administration's push. "They're in damage-control mode."
Islamophobia strategy
Another facet of the White House outreach efforts is its national strategy to combat Islamophobia, announced last week.
"President   for office to restore the soul of our nation. He is unequivocal: There is no place for hate in America against anyone. Period," the White House said in its announcement on November 1.
The administration did not provide a timeframe as to when the plan would be finalised.
Taking on hate is a national priority.
Today, @POTUS  and I are announcing the country's first National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia.
This action is the latest step forward in our work to combat a surge of hate in America. pic.twitter.com/pxZAn7RymY
- Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) November 1, 2023
However, the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), one of the country's largest   groups, was quick to dismiss the White House's push.
"The first and most important step that President Biden must take to address surging anti-Muslim bigotry is the step that American Muslim leaders and organizations have repeatedly called for: demand a ceasefire in Gaza," CAIR said in a statement.
"Islamophobia is surging as a result of the Israeli government's massacres of civilians in Gaza and the dehumanizing, racist and Islamophobic rhetoric used to both justify those massacres as the 'price of war' and foment hate against Muslims and Palestinians around the world."
Last month,   the thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza as "the price of waging war".
Taeb said Muslim American advocates have been pushing for formal US measures to combat Islamophobia for years, which raises questions about the timing of last week's announcement.
"Now finally in the midst   that's happening in Gaza, because they want to mitigate the backlash that they have been getting, they try to now rollout this strategy to say they care about Muslim lives here," Taeb told Al Jazeera. "The whole thing is just nonsense."

Palestinian American advocate Hanna Hanania also said the Biden administration's outreach efforts were "too little, too late".
"As far as the community itself and how it's perceiving these meetings, I don't think it's making a huge difference," Hanania told Al Jazeera.
"I think the community is extremely angry and very upset. And basically, there are so many voices saying: We should not be voting for Biden next time."
He also criticised the administration for focusing on Islamophobia and largely ignoring anti-Palestinian sentiment, which affects Palestinian American Christians, as well as Jewish allies who support Palestinian rights.
'It's done'
Hanania also said the Biden administration is contributing to a perception of Palestinians as barbaric, when in fact they are victims.
He pointed to recent statements from White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who invoked the 2017 neo-Nazi protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, when asked about ongoing "anti-Israel" demonstrations at a press briefing.
Biden also made   that he saw photos of decapitated Israeli children after the Hamas attack, Hanania added.
On Saturday, as tens of thousands of people gathered in Washington, DC, to   in Gaza, Biden was a top target of speeches, chants and signs that accused him of sponsoring war crimes against Palestinians.
But with Arab and Muslim communities appearing to move on collectively from Biden and his Democratic Party, many are left with no political home.
Republicans have expressed even more hawkishly pro-Israel views. Last week, Republican lawmakers introduced a bill  to ban Palestinians from entering the US and deport Palestinians already in the country who received visas after October 1.
Despite such initiatives, several protesters on Saturday told Al Jazeera that the "lesser of two evils" argument to get them to vote for Democrats no longer works given the   in Gaza.
"They have no more votes — from me or my family or anybody," Maria Habib, a Lebanese American demonstrator, said of the Democrats. "It's done. I did vote for them in the past because basically, we don't have a better choice. Now, it's not even a choice."

Hamas releases 13 Israeli captives after hours-long delay, Qatar confirms

Hamas has handed over 13 Israeli captives and four foreign nationals to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) after a delay of several hours as the group claimed that Israel had violated the terms of a truce.
The impasse was resolved following mediation by Qatar and Egypt on Saturday, the   of the pause in hostilities in the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
Israel is now expected to release 39 Palestinian prisoners from its jails.
Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson for Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a post on X that 13 Israelis and four foreign nationals had been handed over to the ICRC.
They were on their way to the Rafah border crossing between southern Gaza and Egypt before travelling to Israel.
Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari updated that 13 Israeli captives and four Thai nationals were with the ICRC and were on their way to the border crossing known as Kerem Shalom, or Karam Abu Salem.
The convoy "returning to Israel" is making its way through Egyptian territory, he said.
Al Jazeera's Hamdah Salhut, reporting from East Jerusalem, said the Israeli military confirmed "just moments ago" that Hamas had handed over the captives to the ICRC.
"They will then be handed over to the Israeli military. They will be taken to an airbase in southern Israel for an initial check where they will then be flown to several different hospitals throughout the Tel Aviv area for additional medical and psychological checks," she said.

Hamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan had said earlier that the aid deliveries permitted by Israel had fallen short of what had been promised and were not reaching northern Gaza, which was the target of Israel's offensive.
Only 65 of 340   that had entered Gaza since Friday had reached northern Gaza, which was "less than half of what Israel agreed on", Hamdan said from Beirut.
The Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, earlier said Israel had failed to respect the terms of the   release.
Qadura Fares, the Palestinian commissioner for prisoners, said Israel had not released detainees by seniority, as was expected.
Israel has said 50 trucks with food, water, shelter equipment and medical supplies had deployed to northern Gaza under United Nations supervision, the first significant aid delivery there since the start of the war seven weeks ago.
The row over the second swap of captives for prisoners quashed hopes after 13 Israeli women and children were freed by Hamas on Friday. Some   were released from Israeli jails.
Israel's military spokesman, Daniel Hagari, said the government was committed to complying with the truce agreement with Hamas but that there were many parties and factors involved. 'And every day brings with it its complexities,' he added.
Hagari pointed to the remarkable progress in efforts to release the captives.
Yet,   were reported to have been killed by the Israeli military and 11 wounded as they attempted the trip to northern Gaza on Friday.
A large number of displaced people were   as the four-day truce brokered by Qatar took effect on Friday. However, Israel has warned people that they will not be allowed to enter the north of the war-torn enclave.
Truce extension?
Before the snag in the latest hostages-to-prisoners exchange, Egypt, which controls the Rafah border crossing through which aid supplies have resumed into southern Gaza, said it had received "positive signals" from all parties over a possible extension to the pause in fighting.
Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypt's State Information Service (SIS), said in a statement that Cairo was holding extensive talks with all parties to reach an agreement that would mean "the release of more detainees in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails".
Israel has said the truce could be extended if Hamas continues to release hostages at a rate of at least 10 per day. A Palestinian source has said up to 100 hostages could go free.
For now, 50 of about 240 hostages are to be exchanged for 150 Palestinian prisoners over four days under the truce, the first halt in fighting since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people.
Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas, raining bombs and shells on the enclave and launching a ground offensive in the north. Israel's relentless bombardment has killed more than 14,800 people, roughly 40 percent of them children, Palestinian health authorities said on Saturday.

UN Security Council meets on Gaza-Israel, but fails to agree on statement

October 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has met behind closed doors in an emergency session amid the war between Israel and Gaza but failed to achieve the unanimity needed for a joint statement.
At least 1,100 people have already been killed since Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the blockaded Gaza Strip, launched an assault on Israeli towns on Saturday and took hundreds of people hostage.
Israel retaliated by declaring a  and pounding densely-populated Gaza, killing hundreds of people.
The United States called on the council's 15 members to strongly condemn  .
"There are a good number of countries that condemned the Hamas attacks. They're obviously not all," senior US diplomat Robert Wood told reporters after the session.
"You could probably figure out one of them without me saying anything," said Wood, in a reference to Russia, whose relations with the West have deteriorated sharply since its invasion of Ukraine.
The council met for about 90 minutes and heard a briefing from the UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland.
Diplomats said members led by Russia were hoping for a broader focus than condemning Hamas.
A statement needs to be agreed upon by consensus.
"My message was to stop the fighting immediately and to go to a ceasefire and to meaningful negotiations, which was told for decades" by the Security Council, said Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's UN ambassador.
"This is partly the result of unresolved issues," he said.
The United Arab Emirates, which   as part of a landmark 2020 deal, said it expected more UNSC meetings on the crisis.
"I think everyone understands that today, the situation is one of grave concern," said the UAE Ambassador Lana Zaki Nusseibeh.
"Many members of the Council believe that a political horizon leading to a two-state solution is the only way to finally solve this conflict," she said.
'Path to peace'
Neither Israel nor the Palestinian Authority (PA), based in the West Bank and a political rival to Hamas, attended the meeting because they are currently on the Security Council.
The Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour called on diplomats to focus on ending the Israeli occupation.
"Regrettably, history for some media and politicians starts when Israelis are killed," he said.
"This is not a time to let Israel double down on its terrible choices. This is a time to tell Israel it needs to change course, that there is a path to peace where neither Palestinians nor Israelis are killed."
In an open letter sent to UNSC members ahead of the meeting, three Palestinian human rights organisations said the UN's inaction had enabled the latest violence and meant its members were "complicit" in what had happened.
The Palestine-based organisations - Al-Haq, Al-Mezan Centre for Human Rights and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights - called on UN member states to address the 'root causes and protect the Palestinian people from Israeli attacks'.
Meanwhile, ahead of the meeting, Israel's UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan showed graphic pictures of Israeli civilians being taken captive by Hamas.
"These are war crimes - blatant, documented war crimes," Erdan told reporters.
"This unimaginable, unimaginable atrocity must be condemned. Israel must be given steadfast support to defend ourselves - to defend the free world."
Home to some 2 million people and measuring about 365sq km (141sq miles), the   has been ruled by Hamas since 2007 since a brief war with forces loyal to the PA.
Its assault in Israel coincides with US-backed moves to nudge Saudi Arabia towards normalising ties with Israel in return for a defence deal between Washington and Riyadh.
"We don't see any reason that should be off the table," said Erdan. "We still want it to happen. We'll do everything that we can to live in co-existence with all of our neighbours."

Palestinian teen killed in Israeli raid in northern occupied West Bank

August 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli forces have shot and killed a Palestinian teenager during a raid in a town in the northern occupied West Bank, Palestinian health officials say.
Othman Abu Khoruj, 17, was fatally shot in the head during a raid on the town of Zababdeh, south of Jenin, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that Israeli forces had entered Zababdeh to make an arrest.
Yousef Sharqawi, a Palestinian who works at a local supermarket, told Al Jazeera that 12 Israeli military vehicles had entered the town, looking for his younger cousin Yazan Sharqawi.
"They surrounded two of our family homes, then proceeded to enter, searching for Yazan," Sharqawi said. "His father told them he was not in the house, so they made him call Yazan on the phone."
The younger Sharqawi, 24, was working at a bakery and was promptly arrested as soon as he arrived home.
In confrontations that ensued as young Palestinians tried to repel the Israeli soldiers, Othman Abu Khuroj was shot twice, once in the head and once in the shoulder, witnesses said.
Abu Khuroj's father, Atef, was working in the fields when he heard his son was injured.
"I arrived at the hospital, and they told me he was gone," the 57-year-old said. "My son worked at the bakery from 8pm until 7am, and the last time I saw him was the day before. He was joking and stole a cigarette from me. He was my youngest boy."
Othman, who like many Palestinian youth had to drop out of school to help his family financially, had been jailed by Israel for a month earlier this year.
"Ask the town about him. He was loved by everyone," his father said.
The armed wing of Islamic Jihad, al-Quds Brigade, issued a statement claiming Othman Abu Khuroj as one of its fighters.
"We affirm that the blood of the martyrs will remain the fuel for our continued resistance and that these sacrifices that our heroic fighters make will not be lost," the statement said.
For its part, the Israeli army said its soldiers had opened fire after "explosive devices" were thrown at them.
"A hit was identified," it said in a statement.
Israeli troops routinely carry out raids into areas such as Jenin that are nominally under the civil and security control of President Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian Authority.
Arrests and interrogation
In the southern West Bank, the Israeli army captured two Palestinians who were suspected of carrying out a   on a car the day before near Hebron that killed an Israeli settler and seriously wounded another.
A statement by the Israeli army said joint forces from the army, the Shin Bet security service and commandos of the Border Guard, known as Yamam, arrested the two suspects, who are related.

The two suspects confessed during interrogation to involvement in the attack, the Israeli military said. Israeli security forces said they also confiscated the rifle used to shoot at the car on Monday.
Palestinian media identified the two suspects arrested near Hebron as Saqer and Mohammed al-Shantir.
The attack came two days after an Israeli father and son were   at a car wash in the West Bank town of Huwara.
Israel has yet to make any arrests in that case despite a search operation that has seen troops raid villages and search house to house.
Overnight into Tuesday, the Israeli military said its forces conducted further large-scale searches and arrest raids throughout the West Bank.
According to the Palestinian Prisoners Club, at least 50 Palestinians were arrested, the majority of them former prisoners who had spent time in Israeli jails.
"This campaign of arrests is considered one of the largest since the beginning of the year," it said in a statement, adding that the detentions were accompanied by "systematic abuse, severe beatings of detainees and their families, threats, and vandalism".
The occupied West Bank has been rocked by violence since early last year with repeated deadly raids by the army and violence by settlers against Palestinian communities as well as a string of attacks by Palestinians on Israeli targets.
According to the United Nations,   have been killed this year, the highest number of fatalities since 2005. Nearly 30 Israelis were killed in the same period.

Here is the   on Friday, October 13, 2023:
Fighting
Israel says it attacked 750 'military targets' overnight in the densely  , including 12 high-rise buildings.
An Israeli ground invasion of Gaza is likely to start over the weekend, former Australian ambassador to Lebanon Ian Parmeter told Al Jazeera, adding that the operation would result in heavy casualties.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Israeli government showed him photographs and videos of Hamas atrocities, including of a baby riddled with bullets, soldiers beheaded and young people burned.
Gaza's ruling Hamas called on Palestinians to rise up on Friday in protest against Israel's bombardment of the enclave, urging Palestinians to march to East Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque.
Human Rights Watch accused Israel of using white phosphorus munitions in its military operations   and Lebanon.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned violence against civilians.
Egypt said it was directing international aid flights for Gaza to an airport in Sinai near the Gaza border.
Al Jazeera's Gabriel Elizondo, reporting from New York, said eight hours of the Israeli military's 24-hour deadline have already apparently elapsed for the 1.1 million people who have been ordered out of northern Gaza.
'The UN says that they received this [evacuation order] around midnight Gaza time. It's now a little after 8am Gaza time, meaning that if these 24 hours began at midnight, we are now at about 16 hours, that's an important thing to keep in mind,' Elizondo said.
Human impact
The UN considers it impossible for the relocation to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences," UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said of the Israeli military's call to depopulate northern Gaza.
"The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation."
Israeli   have made major cemeteries in Gaza too dangerous to reach so mourning families are burying their dead in informal graveyards dug in empty lots.
Israel's public broadcaster Kan said   had risen to more than 1,300, and at least 3,000 wounded.
Gaza authorities said more than 6,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 6,000 wounded.
Diplomacy and international reaction
The United Kingdom is deploying two Royal Navy ships and surveillance aircraft to the eastern Mediterranean to support Israel and reinforce regional stability.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Jordan where he will meet King Abdullah II and Palestine's President Mahmoud Abbas.
Israel, the White House and some rival Republican presidential candidates criticised former US President Donald Trump after he described Hezbollah as "smart" and said Netanyahu "was not prepared" for the attack.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the German Chancellor Olaf Scholzthat a sovereign Palestinian state should be established for a lasting solution to the conflict, the Turkish presidency said.
French   and water cannon to break up a banned rallyin support of the Palestinian people in Paris.
China's top diplomat and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle East conflict, and that crux of the matter was that "justice" had been denied to the Palestinian people.
Iran's foreign ministersaid the continuation of crimes against Palestinians will receive a response from "the rest of the axis" andIsraelwill be responsible for the consequences.

Israel's 'war against Gaza's children' explained

One child is killed every 15 minutes in the Israeli bombings of Gaza, according to a Palestinian NGO, highlighting the toll the current war has exacted on children.
More than 100 children  have been killed every day since Israel started bombing the besieged Palestinian enclave on October 7 in the wake of the deadly Hamas attack. More than 3,400 Palestinians have been killed in the deadliest Israeli assault in decades.
"We are witnessing a genocide in real time,' a spokesperson for The Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP) said.
At least 14 children were reportedly also among the 1,400 Israeli victims of the October 7 Hamas attack. About 200 people taken captive by Hamas also include children. Israel has not released data on the demographics of all of those killed in that attack.
Aren't children legally protected in wars?
Yes, they're meant to be. Internationally accepted rules of armed conflict were passed under the Geneva Conventions in 1949, which state children must be protected and treated humanely.
Israel ratified the conventions in 1951, just a few years after one and a half million Jewish children were killed in Europe during the Holocaust.
The disproportionate use of military might in Gaza is being billed by Israel as a legitimate means to destroy Hamas. And so civilian deaths tallied up in the attacks, including children, do not qualify as war crimes, Israel claims.

What effect is the war having on children?
Parents, like Esra Abu Ghazzah, try to find ways to calm their children from the bombings and destruction around them. The 30-year-old mother   her children, aged eight and two, have started to vomit after air strikes, and are also wetting the bed. Both are responses to heightened fear.
The Abu Ghazzah children are part of the 95 percent of Palestinian children in Gaza who are living with the psychological effects of war.
A research paper  written by Palestinian psychologist Dr Iman Farajallah found that children who survive wars do not emerge unscathed and can pay a high price psychologically, emotionally and behaviourally.
Some children display restlessness, regression or violent behaviour.
For Samah Jabr, a 35-year-old mother of four in Gaza City, her eldest son, Qusay, who is 13, is her main worry.  :'He is very agitated and lashes out a lot these days. He jumps at any sound,' she said. 'He can't bear anyone speaking loudly, even if they're joking. I try to tell him that this war will end.'
Others may not want to leave their mothers' sight, explains Farajallah. "They won't even leave the room to go to the bathroom or kitchen without their mothers, and I'm talking about teenagers here."

How have schools been affected?
With the latest campaign of relentless bombing, education has once again been put on hold, as schools turn into makeshift shelters and survival becomes the only lesson.
The United Nations is now sheltering about 400,000 displaced Gazans in its schools and other facilities, but the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees, the UNRWA, which runs 278 schools in Gaza, has said at least four schools have suffered damage from Israeli bombing in which at least six people have been killed.
The Education Above All (EAA) Foundation, which provides scholarships for Palestinians in need at its al-Fakhoora school in Gaza, was destroyed on Tuesday. The EAA released a statement saying that 'collective punishment, reprisals, and attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure are serious violations of international humanitarian law, and if deliberate they are war crimes'.
How is the lack of food and water affecting children?
Israel's total blockade on Gaza has meant no food or water can enter the territory, but Israeli authorities have said they resumed water supplies to southern Gaza on Tuesday. Palestinians have said without electricity to operate the water pumps, the water crisis continues.
With food and water rapidly running out, Gazans are prioritising whatever little water supplies they have for their children.
Children are more at risk of dehydration, and malnourishment can further speed up the effects of having no water.
A Jerusalem-based nutritionist with the UN food agency also told Al Jazeera that poor water sanitation can lead to children facing high risks of diarrhoeal diseases, which are the most common cause of dehydration and the globally leading cause of child mortality for under-fives.
A lack of food at best affects cognitive function and energy levels, and at worst can lead to starvation and death.
What are the long-term consequences?
For those who don't die in this war, they will have to learn how to survive without  the rest of their family members, explained Ghassan Abu-Sitta, a British Palestinian surgeon working with Medical Aid for Palestinians in Gaza. He has called this war 'a war against children'.
"The repercussions of this war will not only affect the victims we have lost, some of which are still trapped under the rubble of their homes but the psychological impact on us civilians and our children will be catastrophic,' Mohammad Abu Rukbeh, senior Gaza field researcher at DCIP, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Is a ceasefire possible soon?
As the bombardment continues, and borders stay sealed, international aid organisations including Save the Children have called for an immediate ceasefire.
UNICEF's statement read: 'An immediate ceasefire and humanitarian access are the top priorities to allow much-needed aid to children and families in Gaza.
'A child is a child. Children everywhere must be protected at all times and must never come under attack."

US vetoes UN resolution calling for humanitarian pause in Israel-Hamas war

October 18th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The United States has vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution that would have condemned Hamas' attack on Israel while calling for a pause in the fighting to allow   into Gaza.
The US was the sole vote against the resolution on Wednesday, with 12 members voting in favour and Russia and the United Kingdom abstaining.
"We are on the ground doing the hard work of diplomacy," US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council after the vote. "We believe we need to let that diplomacy play out."
The Brazil-drafted text would have condemned violence against  , but the US said that it did not do enough to underscore Israel's right to self-defence. The US has typically exercised its Security Council veto to shield Israel from critical resolutions.
'The overwhelming majority of the council, 12 countries, supported that resolution and expressed disappointment after days of negotiations and a humanitarian situation that was rapidly escalating, that the council wasn't able to come together and offer this view, this call for calm, this call for access for humanitarians,' Al Jazeera correspondent Kristen Saloomey reported from UN headquarters in New York City.
The vote came amid soaring tensions in the region, with   taking to the street in several countries after a deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza on Tuesday drew widespread outrage.
Palestinian authorities said at least 471 people were killed in the blast that was caused by an Israeli air raid. Israel says the explosion was the result of a rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) armed group misfiring. The PIJ has rejected the allegation.
The United States has said an analysis of 'overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information' showed that Israel was not behind the attack and that the US would continue to collect evidence.
Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the claims.
Despite the uncertainty around the cause of the explosion, protests across the Middle East have heightened concerns that other armed groups   could join the Israel-Hamas war.
Speaking before the council, UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said that the world was 'at the brink of a deep and dangerous abyss that could change the trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if not of the Middle East as a whole'.
An attack into southern Israel by Hamas on October 7, during which Palestinian gunmen killed   in Israeli towns and kibbutzim and took 199 people captive, has been widely condemned.
Israeli authorities say at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the attack, and that more than 4,400 others were injured.
But Western countries, and especially Israel's most firm ally, the US, have been accused of employing a double standardwhen it comes to potential Israeli violations of international law.
While the US has said that Israel should take steps to avoid killing Palestinian civilians, it has offered firm support and little direct criticism as Israeli air raids on Gaza level entire neighbourhoods, and as an   cuts off access to water, food, electricity, and fuel for the strip's 2.3 million inhabitants.
Palestinian authorities have said that more than 3,400 people have been killed and more than 12,000 others wounded in the Israeli assault on Gaza.
"Hamas' own actions have brought this on - this severe humanitarian crisis," said Thomas-Greenfield.
 , which drafted a failed resolution calling for a ceasefire earlier this week, said the US veto showed that US rhetoric about international law and human rights was self-serving, following months of criticism over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"We have just been witnesses once again of hypocrisy and the double standards of our American colleagues," said Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia.

Former Mossad chief: Israel enforcing apartheid system against Palestinians

September 6th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A former head of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad has said the country is enforcing an   against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
Tamir Pardo has become the latest former senior Israeli official to claim Israel's treatment of Palestinians amounts to apartheid, a reference to the system of racial separation in South Africa that ended in 1994.
"There is an apartheid state here," Pardo said in an interview with the Associated Press news agency, published on Wednesday.
"In a territory where two people are judged under two legal systems, that is an apartheid state," Pardo said, joining a small but growing list of retired officials to endorse an idea that remains largely on the fringes of Israeli discourse and international diplomacy but has gained growing acceptance within human rights circles.
Given Pardo's background, the comments carry special weight in security-obsessed Israel.
Pardo, who served as head of Israel's spy agency from 2011 to 2016, would not say if he held the same beliefs while heading the Mossad.
The former spy chief said that he believed that the question of the Palestinians is among the country's most pressing issues – above Iran's nuclear programme, seen by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an existential threat.
Pardo said that as Mossad chief, he repeatedly warned Netanyahu that he needed to decide what Israel's borders were or risk the destruction of a state for the Jews.
'Israel needs to decide what it wants. A country that has no border has no boundaries,' Pardo said.
Responding to Pardo's comments, Netanyahu's Likud party said that the ex-Mossad chief "should be ashamed".
'Instead of defending Israel and the Israeli military, Pardo slanders Israel,' it said.
Pardo has been critical of the Netanyahu government's attempts to push through a judicial overhaul this year. The government has moved forward with the plans, despite mass protests from the opposition.
System of oppression
Rights groups point to discriminatory policies within Israel and in occupied East Jerusalem, Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has been ruled by the Hamas group since 2007, and its occupation of the West Bank.
Israel exerts overall control of the territory, maintains a two-tier legal system and is building and  .
Last year, rights group Amnesty   for Israel to be held accountable for carrying out 'the crime of apartheid against Palestinians', adding that it was treating them as 'an inferior racial group'.
In a damning investigation, the rights group detailed how Israeli authorities enforced a system of oppression and domination against the Palestinians.
'This system is maintained by violations which Amnesty International found to constitute apartheid as a crime against humanity,' the group said in a statement.
Israel rejects any allegation of apartheid and says Palestinian citizens of Israel enjoy equal rights while calling the treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank a necessity for security reasons.
Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister who lives in an illegal settlement, said on Israeli television in August that his right to freedom of movement was "more important" than freedom of movement for Palestinians.
In 2017, a United Nations report   Israel of having established 'an apartheid regime that oppresses and dominates the Palestinian people as a whole'.
Last year, South Africa called for Israel to be   an "apartheid state".
'As oppressed South Africans, we experienced firsthand the effects of racial inequality, discrimination and denial and we cannot stand by while another generation of Palestinians [is] left behind,' Naledi Pandor, South Africa's minister of international relations and cooperation, said.

Who are Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing fighting Israel?

October 26th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Hamas has been in the spotlight since October 7, when its military wing, the Qassam Brigades, launched an attack on Israeli territory, killing about 1,400 people and taking more than 200 people captives.
Israel has pledged to finish all wings of the Palestinian resistance group, which has been governing the Gaza Strip since 2007, in the wake of the attack. It has killed more than 6,500 Palestinians in   that the United Nations chief said were "  ".
Israel has launched six major assaults on Gaza since its troops withdrew from there in 2005. In 2012, it killed Ahmad Jabari, the chief of the Qassam Brigades, in air raids.
Here's what to know about the origins and evolution of the Brigades:
What is Hamas and when was it founded?
  by Sheikh Ahmed Yasin and his aide Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi as an offshoot of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood in 1987. The association lasted until 2017 when Hamas indicated ending its ties with the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya (Islamic Resistance Movement) – means zeal.
It emerged during the first Intifada against Israeli occupation during which thousands of Palestinians came out to protest peacefully against Israeli land expropriation and illegal settlements. After a harsh response to their protest, Palestinians started to use rocks, and some groups resorted to small arms.
Hamas favoured armed resistance to liberate Palestine and opposed the 1993 Oslo Accords, saying Israel used the deal to expand illegal settlements on territories occupied in 1967.
In 2006, the group decided to participate in elections in Gaza.It won, but the transfer of power was not peaceful, as Fatah – the party that dominates the Palestinian Authority (PA) – tried to oust them from the Gaza Strip.
Israel imposed a land, sea and air blockade on the enclave after Hamas took power, and it still decides what and who goes in and comes out of the Strip – making it effectively an "open-air prison".
Ismail Haniyeh, who had close ties with Hamas founder Yasin, leads the political wing of Hamas today.
According to a survey by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in March, most Palestinians would vote for Haniyeh over current PA President Mahmoud Abbas or his Fatah party.
Hamas's continued   activities, including food distribution during Ramadan and building schools, have solidified its support.
What are the Qassam Brigades?
Hamas established its military unit in 1992 to centralise and structure the military actions its fighters had been taking against Israel in the 1980s and 1990s.
The name is inspired by a Syrian fighter, Ezzedine al-Qassam, who struggled against British occupation after he was expelled to Palestine, according to the group's official website.
Mohammed Deif is the military commander, assisted by his deputy, Marwan Issa.
The Qassam Brigades' actions against Israel have helped Hamas gain popularity among large segments of Palestinians,  .
The   has become unpopular as it has failed to stop illegal settlements and continues   with Israel. It became further marginalised by the rise of extreme far-right Israeli politics.
How strong are the Qassam Brigades?
According to the CIA World Factbook, the Qassam Brigades have 20,000 to 25,000 members, although this number is  .
The Brigades have lost   of fighters in Israeli attacks and its resources have been depleted in Israeli air raids.
Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza provided Hamas with the opportunity to rebuild its military wing. Financial support, allegedly from Iran, is said to have enabled the armed group to develop sophisticated military capabilities. Hamas sees its arsenal as a  .
What are the Qassam Brigades's military activities?
The Brigades are said to acquire their weapons through smuggling, allegedly getting some military support from Iran, and making some weapons locally, according to the CIA Factbook. Al Jazeera, however, could not independently verify the claims.
They tend to rely on rocket attacks and have added drones to their arsenal recently.
According to a 2021 report by the US Department of State, the al-Qassam and other Palestinian armed groups launched more than 4,400 rockets in confrontations with Israel in 2021. In 11 days of fighting, at least 260 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes while Israeli fatalities stood at 13.
Reports say the al-Qassam has expertise in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and rocket launchers, antitank missiles and mortars, but they rely a great deal on strategy and stealth, with an extensive tunnel infrastructure that   to move around undetected.
Why did Hamas attack on October 7?
Hamas said its attack was in response to Israeli violations of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and rising settler violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
It also said that it had managed to take enough captives to bargain for the release of Palestinian prisoners languishing in Israeli jails, and some analysts have saidthe acceleration of Arab-Israeli normalisation may have been another factor.
'This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on Earth,' said Deif, the Qassam Brigades military commander. He openly called on supporters and Muslim nations to join the armed struggle.
What are Gaza's other armed resistance groups?
Other armed groups in Gaza have indicated that they are joining the current resistance against Israeli forces.
Chief among them are the Palestinian Islamic Jihad's Saraya al-Quds Brigades. Formed in 1992, al-Quds has claimed responsibility for at least 23 rocket attacks, according to data  gathered by the Critical Threats Project.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine also has an active military presence in Gaza through the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades and has been joining calls for armed resistance through official Telegram messages.

Israel intensifies Gaza bombardment as internet and phone services go down

Israel has intensified its bombardment of the beseiged Gaza Strip as internet and mobile communications services collapsed in the Palestinian territory.
An extended series of large explosions on lit up the sky over Gaza City after nightfall on Friday, and an Al Jazeera corrospondent said northen Gaza was being pounded by air raids and artillery.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said it had completely lost contact with its operations room in Gaza and all its teams operating on the ground.
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said Israel increased air raids "in a very significant way" and that ground forces were "expanding their activity" in Gaza.
He told residents of Gaza City to move south on Friday night, as Israeli escalating  pound the strip.
'In the last two hours, we could hear intensive air strikes and intensive artillery shells at the same time, which is something unusual - which means the strength of the fire is much more than in the previous days," said Al Jazeera's Safwat Kahlout, reporting from Gaza City.
'Today is the worst in terms of the strength of the Israeli fire, and we can hear some explosions … coming from the sea as well, specifically in the north of the Gaza Strip.
'The air strikes and the artillery shells are intensifying now in the north," he said.
The Palestinian telecommunication company Jawwal said in a social media post late on Friday that mobile phone and internet services have been shut off.
'We don't have any internet, we don't have any kind of signals on our phones, we've become totally isolated in the territory,' Al Jazeera Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Khan Younis in Gaza on Friday. Residents were "terrified and afraid," he said.
The service outage comes as Palestinians brace for the possibility of an anticipated Israeli ground invasion of Gaza. Israeli officials have threatened to carry out a ground assault to topple Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that governs the territory.
Israel has bombed the strip relentlessly since Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel on October 7 that killed more than 1,400 people.
Since that attack Israel has imposed a "  " Gaza, cutting access to food, water, fuel, and electricity for the enclave's 2.3 million residents who have few options for seeking refuge.
The United Nations warned that "many more will die" as a result of Israel's ongoing siege of Gaza, which has also caused sewage to flow into the streets.
"People in Gaza are dying; they are not only dying from bombs and strikes: soon many more will die from the consequences of (the) siege imposed on the Gaza Strip," said Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for the UN agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).
"Basic services are crumbling, medicine is running out, food and water are running out, the streets of Gaza have started overflowing with sewage."

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called for Israel to stop "killing babies," earning a furious response from Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu.
Trudeau said on Tuesday that the "killing of women, of children, of babies" in the besieged Gaza Strip must end. Netanyahu pushed back, insisting that Hamas is responsible for civilian deaths as Israeli forces continue to batter the enclave.
"I urge the government of Israel to exercise maximum restraint," Trudeau said in his sharpest criticism of Israel since the war on Gaza broke out more than five weeks ago. "The world is watching, on TV, on social media – we're hearing the testimonies of doctors, family members, survivors, kids who have lost their parents.
"The world is witnessing this killing of women, of children, of babies. This has to stop," he told a news conference in the western province of British Columbia.
In a post on X directed at Trudeau, early on Wednesday, Netanyahu said: "It is not Israel that is deliberately targeting civilians but Hamas that beheaded, burned and massacred civilians in the worst horrors perpetrated on Jews since the Holocaust.'
"The forces of civilization must back Israel in defeating Hamas barbarism," Netanyahu continued.

It is not Israel that is deliberately targeting civilians but Hamas that beheaded, burned and massacred civilians in the worst horrors perpetrated on Jews since the Holocaust.
While Israel is doing everything to keep civilians out of harm's way, Hamas is doing
- Benjamin Netanyahu – בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) November 15, 2023
Canada has maintained that Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas after the Palestinian group attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people.
But it has also expressed increasing concern over the mounting death toll in the battered and besieged enclave, where more than 11,200 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the conflict started.
"The price of justice cannot be the continued suffering of all Palestinian civilians," Trudeau said on Tuesday. "All wars have rules. All innocent life has equal worth. Israeli and Palestinian.'
About 350 Canadian citizens, permanent residents and family members had been evacuated from Gaza, he added.
The Canadian leader also called on Hamas to stop using civilians as human shields and to release all hostages it took on October 7 "immediately and unconditionally".
On X, Netanyahu said 'Israel is doing everything to keep civilians out of harm's way,' even as his army relentlessly bombards Gaza.
On  , Israeli soldiers raided the al-Shifa Hospital, which they have been attacking for days. Thousands of patients and displaced Palestinians are trapped inside, including dozens of premature   who are fighting for their lives.
International rights groups have said Israel's attacks on hospitals 'should be investigated as  '.
Last week, Trudeau called for a significant humanitarian pause in the conflict to allow for the release of all hostages and the delivery of enough aid to address civilian needs in Gaza.

Malaysia's Anwar rejects West's 'pressuring attitude' to condemn Hamas

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has rejected Western pressure to condemn Hamas, saying his government will continue to maintain relations with the armed group.
Anwar said that Western officials have repeatedly asked Malaysia to condemn Hamas in meetings but his government "does not agree" with their attitude.
'I said that we, as a policy, have a relationship with Hamas from before, and this will continue,' Anwar said on Monday in remarks to parliament.
'As such, we don't agree with their pressuring attitude, as Hamas, too, won in Gaza freely through elections, and Gazans chose them to lead.'
Western governments have condemned Hamas and called on other countries to stand with Israel after Hamas earlier this month carried out the deadliest attack on the country in decades.
More than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, were killed when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel by air, land and sea on October 7, according to Israeli officials.
Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 2,750 people and wounded nearly 10,000 others, according to Palestinian officials. Another 1,000 people are believed to be trapped under rubble in the enclave.
Malaysia, where about 60 percent of the population is Muslim, is a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights and does not have diplomatic ties with Israel.
Last week, Anwar criticised the international community for what he said was their one-sided stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict.
'The international community continues to take one-sided actions regarding all forms of cruelty and oppression to the Palestinian people. The confiscation of land and property belonging to the Palestinian people is done relentlessly by the Zionists," he said on X.
'As a result of this injustice, hundreds of innocent lives were sacrificed. Malaysia remains in solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people.'

The Malaysian leader's comments came as his country's foreign ministry issued a statement urging the United Nations Security Council to call for a ceasefire.
'There should be no disproportionate treatment and flagrant hypocrisy in dealing with any regime that practices apartheid and blatantly violates human rights and international law," the ministry said.
On Friday,  , chanting 'Free Palestine' and 'Crush the Zionists' as they burned effigies draped with Israeli flags.
Hamas leaders have in the past visited Malaysia and met with its leaders.
In 2013, former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak defied Israel's blockade on Gaza and crossed into the enclave following an invitation from the group.

Israeli soldier killed in car ramming attack by Palestinian

One Israeli soldier has been killed and two others injured in a ramming attack by a Palestinian truck driver at a checkpoint between Israel and the occupied West Bank, Israeli police and medical officials said.
The ramming happened at the Maccabim checkpoint, known to Palestinians as Beit Sira, on Thursday, and the driver left the scene immediately, only to be stopped at another checkpoint about six kilometres (four miles) away where he was shot and died, Israeli daily Haaretz reported.
According to a statement from the Israeli army, the driver was "neutralised".
In a separate statement, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant offered his condolences to the family of the soldier killed and praised the security forces "for their determined action" in killing the attacker.
An Israeli police commander described the driver as a 41-year-old Palestinian who had a permit to work in Israel.
Video circulating on social media showed a white truck surrounded by security guards at the second checkpoint as gunshots rang out.
The checkpoint where the truck rammed the soldiers is on a major highway leading from central Israel through the occupied West Bank and into Jerusalem and is next to the Israeli city of Modiin. The checkpoint is typically packed with commuters and security guards or soldiers.

The incident comes a day after a 15-year-old Palestinian teenager was   by an off-duty police officer after stabbing and wounding an Israeli settler in a light-rail station in occupied East Jerusalem.
Overnight on Thursday, four Israeli soldiers were wounded by an explosive device as they patrolled and escorted Jewish settlers to Joseph's Tomb in the occupied West Bank city of Nablus, a point of confrontation that has regularly witnessed protests by Palestinians.
Israel has intensified its near-nightly raids in the occupied West Bank since early last year, and attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian towns and villages have increased.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed since the start of 2023, in what the United Nations said is the deadliest year for Palestinians since it began documenting fatalities in 2006.
At least 30 Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks in the same period.

The Gaza Strip has sustained widespread destruction as the Israeli military has bombarded the besieged enclave of 2.3 million people for more than two weeks. Even its south, which Israel had declared a safe zone, has not been spared.
Satellite imagery and photographs show entire neighbourhoods have been levelled with many hospitals, schools, places of worship and homes damaged or destroyed by Israeli land, sea and air attacks.
In the following infographic series, Al Jazeera maps out Gaza's damaged communities and neighbourhoods across the strip's five governorates: North Gaza, Gaza City, Deir el-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah.
Gaza's densely populated neighbourhoods
Bordered by Israel and Egypt on the Mediterranean coast, the Gaza Strip is 365sq km (141sq miles). At only 41km (25 miles) long, it can take less than an hour to drive from Beit Hanoon in the north to Rafah in the south.
The Palestinian enclave has a population of 2.3 million people, including 1.7 million refugees who were ethnically cleansed from areas that now form part of Israel. Most refugees live in or near Gaza's eight refugee camps.
Since 2007 when Hamas came to power, Israel has maintained strict control over Gaza's airspace and territorial waters and restricted the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza.
(Al Jazeera)
North Gaza's neighbourhoods
(Al Jazeera)
North Gaza extends for 10km (6 miles) and shares the only crossing into Israel through Beit Hanoon, also known as the Erez crossing. North Gaza is home to the Jabalia refugee camp, the largest in the strip.
The 61sq-km (24sq-mile) area is home to 440,000 people and includes the following communities and neighbourhoods: Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoon, Jabalia refugee camp, Madinat al-Awda and Jabalia al-Balad.
Jabalia refugee camp
The Israeli military has repeatedly hit the Jabalia camp, including on  ,   and  , killing more than 100 people. The camp houses three United Nations-run schools, which have been converted into shelters for hundreds of displaced families.

Gaza City's neighbourhoods
(Al Jazeera)
Gaza City is the largest and most populous city within the Gaza Strip with more than 750,000 residents.
Located along Gaza's Mediterranean coastline are the neighbourhoods of Gaza Harbour, the Shati refugee camp, and Northern and Southern Rimal.
Rimal neighbourhoods
At the heart of the Rimal neighbourhoods is al-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical facility in the Gaza Strip.
Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering at the hospital, where Palestinian doctors are warning of an impending infectious disease outbreak due to overcrowding.
Surrounding the hospital are several UN compounds, including the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), the Office of the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP).
Gaza's top universities - including the Islamic University of Gaza, Al-Azhar University-Gaza and Al-Aqsa University, which are just a few hundred metres apart - are also located in Rimal.
On October 7, Israeli warplanes destroyed the Palestine Tower, a 14-storey residential tower in Rimal, reducing it to rubble. The moment was captured live on camera behind Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed.

Shati refugee camp
Israeli attacks have targeted the Shati refugee camp, also known as Beach Camp, several times, terrifying its 90,000 inhabitants living on 0.52sq km (0.2sq miles) of land. On October 9, Israeli strikes destroyed the Yassin Mosque, one of at least 11 mosques that have been destroyed since October 7.

Farther east are the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Radwan, al-Nasr, al-Darraj, al-Tuffah, al-Sabra and Tal al-Hawa.
Tal al-Hawa
On Wednesday, Israeli strikes hit areas near al-Quds Hospital in Tal al-Hawa. More than 8,000 Palestinians had taken refuge at the hospital, which was previously destroyed by Israeli forces in 2009.
Huge bombardments are taking place in the areas around #PRCS  Al Quds #Hospital  in #Gaza  city- which is sustaining damages and shrapnels inside the buildings of PRCS, and constituting high threat- noting that more than 8000 IDPs are taking refuge at PRCS. #NotATarget #WarCrimes pic.twitter.com/Jx3stfVUYV
- PRCS (@PalestineRCS) October 18, 2023
Old City
Just north of the Zeitoun neighbourhood is Gaza's Old City, which is home to several historical sites, including the Great Omari Mosque, known as Gaza's Great Mosque, and two of Gaza's churches: St Philip the Evangelist Chapel and St Porphyrius Church.
On Tuesday, a   at al-Ahli Arab Hospital, also in the Old City, killed nearly 500 Palestinians, many of whom were taking shelter from Israeli bombing. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said the blast was caused by an Israeli air raid. Israel has attributed the explosion to a misfired rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) armed group. The PIJ has denied the allegation. An Al Jazeera investigation has  .
Two days later, an Israeli air attack killed at least 18 people who were sheltering in the St Porphyrius Church, Gaza's oldest church, which was built between the 1150s and 1160s. A Palestinian pastor has called the bombing of St Porphyrius, where hundreds of people had taken refuge, a "war crime".
(Al Jazeera)
Shujaiya
One of the largest neighbourhoods in Gaza City is Shujaiya, which in Arabic means 'courage'.
Shujaiya has experienced extensive destruction in past Israeli military offensives. A particularly devastating episode occurred in July 2014 when the densely populated district bore the brunt of heavy tank and artillery shelling that killed 72 people and injured more than 200 in a single day. The incident drew widespread international criticism and condemnation.
The drone footage below, shot in 2014, shows the remains of Shujaiya after Israel's 50-day-assault.
Al-Zahra
On the outskirts of Gaza City are the neighbourhoods of al-Zahra, al-Mughraqa and Juhor ad-Dik, which have also been hit by Israeli raids.
In al-Zahra, Israeli attacks have levelled at least 10 buildings and left thousands of people either trapped in the rubble or awaiting medical care.

Deir el-Balah's neighbourhoods
(Al Jazeera)
Beginning at Wadi Gaza, a river that divides Gaza roughly into north and south, Deir el-Balah is named after the Monastery of the Date Palm and is one of Gaza's largest agricultural producers.
Gaza's only operating power plant is located along the district's boundary with Gaza City.
Deir el-Balah is also home to four out of Gaza's eight refugee camps: Nuseirat, al-Bureij, al-Maghazi and Deir el-Balah.

Nuseirat refugee camp
The Nuseirat camp was established in the aftermath of the 1948 Nakba ("catastrophe" in Arabic) when an estimated 750,000 Palestinians were forced out of their homes by Zionist militias.
Today, the camp is home to 85,000 refugees crammed into an area of 0.68sq km (0.26sq miles).
Israeli air raids have bombed a number of bakeries in Gaza, killing dozens of people and injuring hundreds who were queueing to buy bread, the Palestinian WAFA news agency reported. One such bakery was the Al Nuseirat Bakery, which was destroyed on Wednesday.

The other neighbourhoods in Deir el-Balah include az-Zawayda, al-Musaddar, Wadi as-Salqa and al-Ma'ani.
Khan Younis's neighbourhoods
(Al Jazeera)
Khan Younis is Gaza's largest governorate by area at 108sq km (42sq miles) and is home to 430,000 people. At its centre is the Khan Younis refugee camp, where about 90,000 people live.
The Israeli army has continued striking Khan Younis and other southern areas despite ordering people in Gaza to move south.
Thousands of Palestinians have crowded into squalid tent camps in southern Gaza, many without food or water.

Rafah's neighbourhoods
(Al Jazeera)
Rafah is the southernmost district of Gaza with a population of about 275,000. Rafah is also the name of the crossing with Egypt that is located there.
On Saturday, a convoy of 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered the besieged Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing.
(Al Jazeera)
Cindy McCain, the executive director of the World Food Programme, told Al Jazeera that 20 trucks of aid is not enough.
'The situation inside Gaza is dire. Not only is there no food, there is no water, electricity or fuel. And that combination is not only catastrophic but can lead to more starvation and disease as well,' she said. 'We've got to get more trucks in.'
A second aid convoy entered the besieged territory on Sunday.

Israel has sealed off the territory, forcing Palestinians to ration food and drink filthy water from wells. Hospitals said they are running low on medicine and fuel for emergency generators during a Gaza-wide blackout.
According to the UN, sanitation facilities, water wells, reservoirs and pumping stations have suffered damage due to incessant air strikes.
(Al Jazeera)
Those who are able to get through the Rafah crossing must then make a six- to eight-hour journey through the Sinai Desert, passing several Egyptian checkpoints on their way to Cairo, about 350km (220 miles) away.
The neighbourhoods in Rafah include: Umm al-Kilab, al-Mawasi, al-Qarya al-Suwydiya, Tel es-Sultan, Rafah refugee camp, al-Bayuk and Shokat as-Sufi.

Analysis: Lessons from Day One of truce in Gaza

November 25th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The guns indeed fell silent exactly at 7am (05:00 GMT) on Friday. The transition from loud explosions to a sudden calm that the Gaza Strip has not seen in seven weeks was quite eerie.
Right up to the top of the hour, Israeli forces appeared to be taking advantage of every last minute to keep bombing and their Hamas opponents hit back as much as they could.
To everyone's relief, both sides stopped shooting right on cue. Not a shot was heard as the fighters took a much-needed respite.
All hopes now are that the pause will hold as intended and the ambitious plans for the 96 hours of uneasy truce will be carried out.
A column of Israeli armoured vehicles headed towards Israel, taking soldiers home for short chance to recover. They were not being fired at, so crews stood in open hatches or allowed themselves the luxury of sitting on the vehicles' steel bodies, basking in the morning sun, obviously trusting the pause and not showing signs of anxiety or fear. Many smiled, demonstrating clear relief, as the plan looked like it was working.
Palestinian fighters also headed outdoors. Many changed into civilian clothes and rushed south to see family members and check who survived the intense bombardment and indiscriminate shelling.
Reporters saw aid agencies not waste a second, the first trucks carrying much-needed supplies crossing the Rafah checkpoint from Egypt minutes after Zero Hour. One hundred crossed into the Gaza Strip on day one, and more are scheduled.
Intricate exchange
The first real test, the late afternoon exchange of 13 Israeli captives held by Hamas for 39 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, 24 women and 15 teenage boys, also passed smoothly.
Proving how sensitive the affair is, and fully aware of the possibility that a minor glitch could delay or even stop the planned exchanges, the two sides opted not to handle the logistics directly. Instead, they chose the safest approach, using intermediaries and, in the case of Israeli captives, going through an indirect route.
Hamas first handed 13 Israeli captives to the representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross/Red Crescent (ICRC), who took them across the border into Egypt in a convoy of vehicles, handing them over to Egyptian authorities.
Egyptian 'possession' was very brief, as all Israelis were quickly transferred to their country's secret service, Shin Bet, who flew them by helicopter first to a military base in the Naqab Desert (also called Negev), and then to civilian hospitals where they were reunited with their families.
But this captive release procedure with all its intricacies was not Friday's first. About half an hour before the liberation of Israeli captives, another group unexpectedly served as proof-of-concept: 10 citizens of Thailand and one Filipino were released, under the same procedures that would be used for the most anticipated group.
The Thai captive deal was apparently negotiated separately, with Egypt as an intermediary. The suddenness with which it surfaced out of complete secrecy proves the nature of the complex negotiations for the release of the captives.
Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners in a much simpler procedure – no go-betweens or roundabouts: the women and teenagers had first been transferred to Israel's Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank. At the agreed time, the gates opened, and they were released to their waiting families and then on to East Jerusalem where thousands of Palestinians joined in an impromptu emotional celebration of their return to freedom.
Seeing with different eyes
At the same time, most Israelis were anxiously watching live coverage of the return of the first batch of their compatriots.
An Israeli colleague told me on Saturday that it was only when his family realised how stressed and worried they had been during the seven weeks of collective concern for the captives that they thought of the Palestinians' anxiety for their own, held for many years. 'After this, we may see them with different eyes', he said.
There was no doubt that both sides were overwhelmed by emotions and some observers hoped that the realisation of how much pain both societies are in might somehow bring them together after the war ends.
But the good news of civilians being set free was marred by less-publicised news of others being killed in spite of the fighting being on pause.
While the two militaries refrained from shooting at each other as agreed, the Israelis demonstrated that, in their mind, the truce extends only to the two armed sides.
Israeli forces confronted hundreds of Palestinian civilians trying to return to their homes in north Gaza during the pause. They were defying Israeli orders to remain in the south, distributed in the media and air-dropped leaflets, and Israeli soldiers fired at them.
Two people killed and 11 wounded by direct, aimed, assault-rifle fire is a sad reminder that, as welcome as it is now, the agreed pause has its definite limits, in duration and in scope and a warning against getting euphoric and too hopeful too soon.

Israeli air raids on the besieged Gaza Strip have flattened a tower in the heart of Gaza City   between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli military claimed the lives of hundreds of people.
The attack on Palestine Tower on Saturday came hours after Hamas, the group running the besieged Gaza Strip, launched a multipronged attack by firing thousands of rockets and sending fighters inside Israel.
The hit was caught live on camera as Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed was reporting from another building nearby.

'The building was totally destroyed and brought to the ground,' she said afterwards. "Looking at all the buildings adjacent to it, you can imagine the amount of destruction that is in [the vicinity]."
There was no immediate information about any casualties.
Israel's air force said in a statement its fighter jets have hit two high-rise buildings in Gaza, alleging that they housed Hamas 'military infrastructure'.
It was not immediately clear if one of those buildings the air force was referring to was the Palestine Tower.

Not the first time
Israel has a track record of conducting hits on residential buildings and towers located within the Gaza Strip, one of the world's most densely populated areas.
These actions, referred to by the Israeli army as "precision strikes" targeting armed groups, frequently occur in densely inhabited areas and have resulted in civilian casualties.
During an 11-day conflict in Gaza in 2021, Israel targeted four towers, causing the destruction of three of them, including one that housed the offices of Al Jazeera and The Associated Press news agency.
London-based human rights group Amnesty International has previously raised concerns over Israel's military tactics, asserting that recurring attacks on residential buildings in Gaza demonstrated a disregard for the wellbeing of Palestinian civilians, and could potentially constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity.

Telecommunications cut off in Gaza after fuel runs out

Palestinian telecommunications companies Jawwal and Paltel have announced their network went out of service in the Gaza Strip as a result of failure to allow fuel into the besieged territory.
The companies wrote in statements on X on Thursday that "all energy sources sustaining the network have been depleted". They had   a day earlier that Gaza was facing a "complete blackout" due to a lack of fuel to operate main data centres and switches.
The companies said basic network elements have been relying on batteries since Wednesday afternoon.
All fixed, cellular and internet services in Gaza have now been interrupted, leaving its 2.3 million residents largely cut off from the outside world and from each other.
We regret to announce that all telecom services in Gaza Strip have gone out of service as all energy sources sustaining the network have been depleted, and fuel was not allowed in. #KeepGazaConnected
- Jawwal (@JawwalPal) November 16, 2023
"Ambulances are now standing outside Nasser Hospital with medical staff waiting to hear of any bombardments so they can rush to the areas quickly," Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed reported from Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
"This is not the first time this has happened, and it has caused a great crisis for people trying to reach ambulances or civil defence teams when bombardments occur," she said, adding that the humanitarian situation in the south was also deteriorating.
"There has been no food, water, fuel or electricity for over a month," she said.
Fuel as a 'weapon of war'
Israel cut off fuel shipments into the Gaza Strip as part of a "complete siege" on the territory after Hamas fighters from Gaza launched an attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
Since the attack, Israel has bombarded the Palestinian territory, launched a ground offensive and severely restricted supplies of water, food and electricity. More than 11,600 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to Palestinian authorities, including more than 4,700 children.
This was a sadly predictable consequence of the Israeli government's refusal to all fuel into Gaza to support the generators needed to keep telcom services functioning. Israel also refuses to turn on the electricity. https://t.co/6v0BvboM3j https://t.co/RwSzBrbzBW

The   to enter Gaza since Israel imposed the siege arrived on Wednesday.
The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said it had received 23,000 litres of fuel. However, Israeli authorities have restricted its use exclusively for the transport of aid delivered from Egypt.
"It is appalling that fuel continues to be used as a weapon of war," said UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini.
Since Israel launched a ground invasion in late October, Gaza has already experienced  after Israel cut communications and internet services.
Humanitarian agencies and first responders have warned that blackouts severely disrupt their work and put lives at risk.
'People will be deprived of access to lifesaving information, such as finding areas of safety or contacting emergency services,' said Rasha Abdul-Rahim, director of Amnesty Tech.
"The critical work of humanitarian agencies will also be severely disrupted, as workers lose contact with each other," she added.
"Prolonged and complete communications blackouts, like those experienced in Gaza, can provide cover for atrocities and breed impunity while further undermining humanitarian efforts and putting lives at risk," said Deborah Brown, senior technology researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Communications networks in Gaza have been unreliable since the war began due to lack of electricity and damage to infrastructure due to the bombardment.
The Palestinian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has previously appealed to neighbouring Egypt to operate communication stations near the Gaza border and activate roaming services on Egyptian networks.

US President Biden sued for 'complicity' in Israel's genocide in Gaza

The president of the United States and two of his cabinet members are being sued for failing to prevent and aiding and abetting "genocide" in Gaza.
A federal complaint ( PDF ), filed on Monday against President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, accuses them of 'failure to prevent and complicity in the Israeli government's unfolding genocide'.
New York civil liberties group the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) filed the suit on behalf of Palestinian human rights organisations, Palestinians in Gaza and US citizens with relatives in the besieged enclave that has faced more than a month of relentless bombardment by Israel, which receives funding and weapons from the US government.
More than 11,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched attacks on October 7. This followed a Hamas attack in Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed.
'Numerous Israeli government leaders have expressed clear genocidal intentions and deployed dehumanizing characterizations of Palestinians, including 'human animals',' the CCR wrote in the introduction to its complaint.
It said those "statements of intent", when combined with the 'mass killing' of Palestinians, reveal 'evidence of an unfolding crime of genocide'.
Numerous  ,   and   have also called Israel's actions in Gaza genocide.
'I paid for Israel to kill my cousins'
'Immediately after the launch of Israel's unprecedented bombing campaign on Gaza, President Biden offered 'unwavering' support for Israel, which he and administration officials have consistently repeated and backed up with military, financial, and political support, even as mass civilian casualties escalated alongside Israeli genocidal rhetoric,' the CCR said.
The complaint noted that the US is Israel's closest ally and strongest supporter, as well as its biggest provider of military assistance – with Israel being the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign assistance since World War II. Because of this, it said, the US could have a 'deterrent effect on Israeli officials now pursuing genocidal acts against the Palestinian people'.
Instead, the group said, Biden, Blinken, and Austin 'have helped advance the gravest of crimes' by continuing to provide Israel with unconditional military and diplomatic support while undermining efforts by the international community to stop  .
Speaking to Al Jazeera, Astha Sharma Pokharel, a lawyer at the CCR, said: 'They have a significant responsibility under customary international law, under federal law, to prevent this genocide, to stop supporting this genocide. At every step of the way, at every opportunity, they have failed. They have continued to provide cover to Israel; they have continued to provide material support to Israel; and currently, they intend to send more money and more weapons to Israel.'
Laila al-Haddad, a US citizen and one of the plaintiffs in the case, has lost five relativesin Gaza since Israel launched its attacks.
'I paid for Israel to kill my cousins and my aunt, there's no two ways around it,' she told Al Jazeera. 'It was my tax dollars that did that, that sent those bombs to Israel to kill my family. And so I feel I and all other American taxpayers have a very unique responsibility to hold our government and our elected officials responsible.'
The lawsuit also calls for an end to the $3.8bn in annual military support the US sends to Israel.
The White House has not yet responded to Al Jazeera's requests for comment on the case.

France's Macron the latest Western leader to visit Israel

French President Emmanuel Macron has landed in Tel Aviv for a 'solidarity' visit to Israel amid its   of the Gaza Strip, weeks after deadly attacks launched by the Palestinian group Hamas.
Macron is the latest Western leader to visit Israel, following counterparts from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and others.
He is set to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog on Tuesday to express his country's "full solidarity" with Israel, according to AFP.
The French news agency, which was briefed by Macron's office ahead of the visit, reported on Monday that the president will also call for the "preservation of the civilian population" in Gaza amid Israel's relentless bombardment of the besieged enclave, and the 'resumption of a genuine peace process' for the creation of a Palestinian state.
Macron will also call for a "humanitarian truce" to allow desperately needed aid into Gaza, whose some 2.3 million people have been largely deprived of water, food, electricity, fuel and other basic supplies after an Israeli blockade, the Elysee Palace told AFP.
Macron's visit comes more than two weeks after Hamas members stormed into Israel, killing at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, including about 30 French citizens.
Israel has since relentlessly bombed Gaza, so far killing more than 5,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, while it prepares for a ground invasion of the blockaded area.
During the October 7 attack, Hamas also took more than 200 people  .
The French foreign ministry  said seven of its citizens are still missing and that it has confirmed that 'some of them are hostages of Hamas'.
In Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Macron will also meet the families of French and French-Israeli nationals killed or being held hostage.
The French president also aims to continue efforts "to avoid a dangerous escalation in the region", the Elysee told AFP, amid growing alarm over swelling cross-border exchanges between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.
He will propose relaunching a "true peace process", with the aim of creating a viable Palestinian state in exchange for guarantees from regional powers towards "Israel's security".
Macron will most likely also travel to Lebanon and Egypt, the French newspaper Le Parisien reported, citing diplomatic circles.
Elsewhere on Tuesday, Qatar's emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani warned that the dangerous escalation of the war on Gaza threatened the region and the world. He urged that the fighting should stop and said 'Israel shouldn't be given a green light for unconditional killing'.
In Rome on Tuesday, Italian President Sergio Mattarella emphasised the need to avoid the escalation of violence, and commit to a common and peaceful solution in the region.
On Sunday , leaders of the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Britain underscored their support for Israel and its right to defend itself, but also urged it to adhere to international humanitarian law and protect civilians.

The number of United States citizens confirmed to have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war has risen to at least 22, with at least 17 more Americans unaccounted for, says the US Department of State.
That is an increase in the death toll from 14 on Tuesday, in a war that has killed more than 2,200 on both sides in five days.
A "handful" of US citizens are among the estimated 150 hostages captured by the Palestinian armed group, Hamas, during its unprecedented weekend assault on Israel, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Wednesday.
"Right now we think the number that we know or we believe are held hostage is very small, very small, like less than a handful. But that could change over time," Kirby told reporters.
Palestinian armed group Hamas on Saturday captured an   during an unprecedented assault into southern Israel.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is expected to arrive in Tel Aviv on Thursday as part of the Biden administration's unequivocal support to Israel, on Wednesday said the death toll of US citizens in the continuing war could further rise.
The US military is moving a second aircraft carrier, USS Dwight D Eisenhower, towards Israel as an "available asset" after the USS Gerald R Ford, the US Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, and its strike group reached the eastern Mediterranean Sea.
Hamas had   to kill the hostages if Israel bombed Palestinian homes in Gaza without warning.
The presence of the hostages also presents a dilemma for the Israeli military, which has given little indication that the presence of the hostages in the Gaza Strip will deter Israel from mounting a  .
Israel has   the enclave, tightening an already harsh blockade that it has had in place since 2007 and cutting off access to food, water, and electricity for the strip's 2.3 million Palestinian residents – a  , according to United Nations statutes.
A nonstop barrage of Israeli air raids since Saturday has reduced   in Gaza to rubble and killed at least 1,055 people and wounded thousands of others, according to Palestinian officials.
Kirby said the Biden administration was still in talks with Israel and Egypt to try to arrange safe passage for Gaza's civilians.
"These people are victims, too," he said. "They didn't ask Hamas to do this."

S Africa's ruling ANC to back opposition motion to close Israeli embassy

South Africa's ruling party has said it will support a parliamentary motion calling for the Israeli embassy in South Africa to be closed.
In a statement on Thursday, the African National Congress (ANC) also welcomed a call from President Cyril Ramaphosa for the International Criminal Courtto investigate Israel for war crimes.
'Given the unfolding atrocities in occupied Palestine, the African National Congress will agree to a parliamentary motion which calls upon the government to close the Israeli embassy in South Africa and suspend all diplomatic relations with Israel until it agrees to a ceasefire,' the statement said.
The opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) will propose the motion later on Thursday, also calling for the suspension of all diplomatic relations with Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian people amid Israel's war on Gaza. The motion will be voted on at a later date.
The EFF's motion is largely symbolic as it will be up to Ramaphosa's government whether to implement it. But ANC leader Ramaphosa and senior foreign ministry officials have been vocal in their criticism of Israel's leadership during its military campaign in Gaza, calling on the ICC to investigate them for potential war crimes.
Pretoria's strong support for Palestine dates back decades to the fight against apartheid in South Africa, which the ANC was at the forefront of. The country likens the plight of Palestinians to that of Black South Africans under white minority rule, with former President Nelson Mandela saying in 1997: 'We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.'
WAR CRIMES MUST BE INVESTIGATED

- African National Congress (@MYANC) November 16, 2023
"As South Africa, we have accordingly, together with many other countries across the world, referred this whole Israeli government action to the International Criminal Court," Ramaphosa said on Wednesday during a state visit to Qatar.
"We have put through a referral because we believe that war crimes are being committed there. And of course, we do not condone the actions that were taken by Hamas earlier, but similarly, we condemn the actions that are currently underway and believe that they warrant an investigation by the ICC," he added.
Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas that governs Gaza have been at war for more than a month. Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people. Israel's air and ground offensive has killed more than 11,300 Palestinians in Gaza.
South Africa's Foreign Minister   told Al Jazeera that Israel must put a stop to 'this real crime against humanity' in Gaza.
'We are appalled at how this horror and tragedy that is unfolding continues to get worse and worse. I think the world has seen enough, and it is time for the most powerful in the world to put a stop to this horror that Israel is unfolding against the people of Palestine,' she said on Wednesday.
Israel's occupation has 'very, very clear similarities' to some of the practices that defined apartheid South Africa, she added.
Earlier this month, South Africa recalled its diplomats from Israel, but ithas not had an ambassador to Israel since 2018.

Israeli tanks besiege Gaza's Indonesian Hospital

Israeli tanks have surrounded northern Gaza's Indonesian Hospital, after artillery fire killed at least 12 Palestinians in the complex, according to the war-torn enclave's Ministry of Health.
Ashraf al-Qudra, Gaza's Health Ministry spokesperson, told Al Jazeera on Monday that "the situation is catastrophic" in Indonesian Hospital, where hundreds of people remain trapped.
"The Indonesian Hospital staff are insisting they will stay to treat the wounded. There are about 700 people, including medical staff and injured people, inside the hospital," he said.
The Israeli military, which rarely publicises troop movements, had no immediate comment.
The Palestinian news agency WAFA said the facility in the northeast Gaza town of Beit Lahia had been hit by artillery fire. Palestinian health officials said there were frantic efforts to evacuate civilians out of harm's way.
Hospital staff denied there were any armed militants on the premises.
The advance on the facility, set up in 2016 with funding from Indonesian organisations, came a day after the World Health Organization evacuated 31 premature babies from al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
They were among more than 250 critically ill or wounded patients stranded there since Israeli forces entered the compound.
The territory's largest health facility is being   at gunpoint after being under siege for several days with 7,000 people inside.
The United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA has reported the "collapse of services" at hospitals across northern Gaza, following widespread strikes and the lack of fuel and medical supplies.
The Israeli military claims Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, has built underground infrastructure below hospitals for military usage, which Hamas and medical officials deny.

Marwan Abdallah, a medical worker at the Indonesian Hospital, said Israeli tanks were visible from the windows.
'You can see them moving around and firing,' he said. 'Women and children are terrified. There are constant sounds of explosions and gunfire.'
Abdallah said the hospital had received dozens of dead and wounded in air raids and shelling overnight.
Israel launched its offensive against Gaza after a wave of brutal cross-border raids by Hamas on October 7 killed more than 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
The Hamas-run government says the death toll from Israel's aerial bombardment and ground operations in the Palestinian territory has reached 13,000, thousands of them children.

'War knows no religion': Gaza's oldest church shelters Muslims, Christians

Gaza City – When an Israeli air raid destroyed Walaa Sobeh's house and much of her neighbourhood, the Palestinian Muslim sought shelter in Gaza's oldest church.
At the Church of Saint Porphyrius, she found not just sanctuary, but a feeling of belonging to "one family" — united by both the terror of   around them and a hope that they could survive Israel's attacks.
So she telephoned other relatives in north Gaza and asked them to make their way to the church, too. Sobeh and her family are among hundreds of Palestinians across different faiths who have found safety — at least for now — at the church.
At a time when the deadly Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 and Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza have sparked a   in parts of the world, the Greek Orthodox churchhas emerged as an emblem of a deeper identity as Palestinians.
"We are here living the day, not sure if we can make it to the night. But what eases our pain is the humble and warm spirit of everyone around," Sobeh said. She described receiving "enormous support from the priests and other people in the church who volunteer tirelessly around the clock to help the displaced families".
So far, the church has escaped Israeli missiles.
"The Israeli military has bombed many places of sanctuary," said Father Elias, a priest at Saint Porphyrius, adding that he was "not sure that Israel won't bomb the church", even though it provides shelter for hundreds of civilians.
Israeli bombs have hit several mosques and   sheltering people whose homes have been blown up.
Any strike on the church "would not only be an attack on religion, which is a vile deed, but also an attack on humanity", Father Elias said. "Our humanity calls us to offer peace and warmth to everyone in need."

A place of solace
Built between the 1150s and 1160s, and named after the 5th-century bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius has provided solace for generations of Palestinians in Gaza, especially in times of fear.
And while the   and those distraught by continuing to live in Gaza under Israeli bombardment now echo in a space once filled with prayers and hymns, there is hope.
Today, the church's ancient yards and sheltered corridors offer shelter to both Muslims and Christians alike, "as war knows no religion", Father Elias said.

'Together as Palestinians, Muslims and Christians'
George Shabeen, a Palestinian Christian and a father of four sheltering in the church with his family, said they had nowhere else to go; their streets had been targeted by three Israeli air raids.
"Coming here saved our lives," he told Al Jazeera. "During the night, we huddle together, Muslims and Christians, old and young, and pray for safety and peace.'
To Sobeh, the fact that families of different religions are together under the church's roofs amid the trauma of the bombing is in itself an act of resistance.
"Israel's purpose is to shatter our community and displace us," she added, her voice shaking. "They might be able to kill us. But we will continue to be together as Palestinians, dead and alive, Muslims and Christians."

US lawmakers introduce resolution urging 'immediate' Gaza ceasefire

October 16th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - Progressive legislators in the United States have introduced a congressional resolution urging 'an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Israel and occupied Palestine'.
Monday's measure — backed by more than a dozen Democratic members of the House of Representatives, including Cori Bush,  , Summer Lee, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — highlighted growing calls in Washington for a ceasefire in Gaza.
"All human life is precious, and the targeting of civilians, no matter their faith or ethnicity, is a violation of international humanitarian law," the proposed resolution  reads.
Despite overwhelming support for Israel in Congress, Bush told reporters during an online briefing that the resolution is an urgent push Americans can rally around.
"Leaders lead from the front, and we move with the call of the people," Bush said. "Our constituents around the country are going to begin calling our colleagues to join us."
We must do everything we can to save lives. @RepRashida , @RepAndreCarson , @RepSummerLee , @RepDeliaramirez , and I are introducing the #CeasefireNOW  Resolution to call for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Israel and Palestine.
I urge my colleagues to join us. pic.twitter.com/DlZ2k365zL
- Congresswoman Cori Bush (@RepCori) October 16, 2023
"The only way to move legislation is to first of all introduce them," Bush added.
The war erupted on October 7 when the Palestinian group Hamas launched a   against Israel from the besieged Gaza Strip, killing hundreds of people and taking dozens captive.
Israel responded with a relentless bombing campaign that has killed more than 2,800 Palestinians, including hundreds of children in Gaza. The World Health Organization has also documented dozens of attacks on medical facilities in Gaza, which have killed at least 12 health workers.
Moreover, Israeli authorities announced a total blockade on Gaza, preventing fuel and other basic supplies from entering the territory. More than 1 million people, including hospital patients, have been   northern Gaza, a demand the United Nations has characterised as "impossible".
Progressive legislators and advocates stressed on Monday that the US has the power to push for an end to the fighting.
With a land invasion of Gaza imminent, Bush said that "hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives hang in the balance".
"And it's not only happening right before our eyes. It's happening with the support and the power of the United States government, and it is shameful," she said.
'Afailure'
Despite the growing crisis, the administration of US President Joe Biden has avoided calling for calm in Gaza.
In fact, the news outlet HuffPost  reported last week that the State Department circulated a memo to its diplomats warning them against using the phrases 'de-escalation/ceasefire', 'end to violence/bloodshed' and 'restoring calm'.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to Israel on Monday, once again voicing the White House's unwavering support for the US ally.
"You know our deep commitment to Israel's right — indeed its obligation — to defend itself and to defend its people," Blinken said in an appearance alongside Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.
In an interview with CBS that aired on Sunday,   for eliminating Hamas. When asked whether it was time to call for a ceasefire, Biden responded instead that Israel has to "go after" the Palestinian group.
"I'm confident that Israel is going to act under the rules of war," Biden said.
In Monday's online briefing, however, Tlaib — the only Palestinian-American member of Congress — described the horrific humanitarian situation in Gaza, home to 2.2 million people.
"Entire families are being wiped out, all while President Biden and Secretary Blinken and the majority of Congress failed to even hint to the need to de-escalate or facilitate a ceasefire. And that to me is a failure," the congresswoman said.
Tlaib stressed that the collective punishment of Palestinians is a war crime. "See what's happening. Don't turn away. All they need to do is see Palestinians as human to see again that these are  ," she said.
Monday's resolution marks a small but significant break in the near-unanimous support for Israel's war effort in Washington.
'We must do everything in our power to end this ongoing violence,' Congressman Jamaal Bowman, another co-sponsor of the resolution, said in a statement.
'Our actions should proceed on the basis of recognising our shared humanity, including rejecting violence in all forms and pursuing an urgent ceasefire and de-escalation so we can save civilian lives.'
'Now we have this'
Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute think tank, said the resolution is important because of the role the US plays in the conflict.
The US provides Israel with at least $3.8bn in military assistance annually, despite human rights groups like Amnesty International accusing the country of imposing apartheid on Palestinians.
That sum is likely to increase this year with US officials   Israel with more weapons and ammunition for the ongoing war.
Washington also regularly uses its   at the UN Security Council to shield Israel from criticism over violations of international law.
"We are not a benign observer in this conflict," Berry told Al Jazeera, referring to the US. "We've enabled the occupation for years and are currently enabling the attacks taking place now. So I think it's important for Congress to take their job seriously."
Beth Miller, the political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action, also underscored the significance of Monday's proposed resolution, saying that it gives rights advocates a solid demand they can take to their lawmakers.
"We haven't had anything yet to push for because the only things that have been coming out of Congress so far have been horrible one-sided resolutions that only value or speak about Israeli life and completely disregard Palestinian life," Miller told reporters. "And now we have this."

Israel and the United Nations are locked in a bitter spat, after UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday night said that the Hamas attacks of October 7 "did not happen in a vacuum".
Guterres's comments, at a UN Security Council meeting., sparked outrage from Israel, whose ambassador, Gilad Erdan asked the UN boss to resign,accusing Guterres of justifying terrorism. Israel has since said it will   to UN officials.
While Guterres condemned the Hamas attacks, he added, "The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation."
So what has the UN's role been in the war that broke out on October 7? Here's a snapshot:
Diplomatic:
Tuesday's Security Council meeting was not the first time Guterres demanded a ceasefire in the region.
On October 7, Guterres condemned the Hamas attacks. He expressed concern for the civilians and urged that all diplomatic efforts are made to avoid an escalation of violence.
He repeated this on October 9, appealing to end "the vicious cycle of bloodshed, hatred and polarisation."
He further urged both sides and other bodies that are involved on October 11 to avoid further conflagration. He also called for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.
He reiterated his appeal for the release of hostages and additionally requested that Israel allow humanitarian aid access into the Gaza Strip on October 15, adding that these actions should not become bargaining chips.
On October 18 after the bombing of the   in Gaza, Guterres called for an   in the region, condemning the   of Palestinians.On October 20, the UN chief   the Rafah crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.
Tuesday marked the fourth meeting of the UN Security Council, where 15 ambassadors of countries convened to discuss the violence that escalated starting October 7.
Two resolutions proposed in these four meetings have failed: the first one was proposed by Russia which did not get enough votes whereas the second one drafted by Brazil was   by the US.
Refuge
  of Gaza residents have fled their homes and have sought refuge in 64 United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) schools.
Due to their affiliation with the UN, these schools were considered safe spaces for refuge.
However, schools are no longer safe. According to UNRWA, at least  schools in Gaza have suffered damage from Israeli bombing.
Aid
The UN's World Health Organization has been involved in getting medical supplies into the besieged Gaza Strip through the Rafah border.
But the aid entering Gaza is not enough for the residents, experts have said, and has been facing delays since Israel is inspecting it.
The aid does   and the fuel shortage is especially alarming as it threatens the functioning of hospitals and UNRWA in Gaza.
Guterres has   the aid 'a drop of aid in an ocean of need".
International law
Guterres has   on multiple occasions that international humanitarian law was being violated in the war between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas.
These statements have been echoed by several world leaders.
China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi   that while every country has the right to self-defence, they should adhere to international law and protect civilians.
Chilean President Gabriel Boric   while condemning the Hamas attack.
In a statement, Venezuela   the conflict is a result of Palestinian people being unable to find their space in international law, urging the UN to fulfil its role as the guarantor of international peace.
The UN has not yet devised a comprehensive way to enforce international humanitarian law and has had a poor track record of success.
There is also a   of the US blocking UN resolutions critical of Israel through its veto power.

'Hunger and despair': UN agency deplores Gaza conditions, child casualties

An urgent ceasefire is a matter of life and death for millions in the Gaza Strip, an official warned at a United Nations Security Council emergency briefing, noting climbing child casualties as Israel continues to bombard the enclave.
Palestinians in Gaza are facing a life-or-death crisis aggravated by the struggle to deliver aid to the Strip's more than two million inhabitants, said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), at the meeting on Monday.
'The level of destruction is unprecedented, the human tragedy unfolding under our watch is unbearable," the official said. "The current siege imposed on Gaza is collective punishment.'
More than half a million Palestinians forced from their homes due to Israel's  , continuing for three weeks, are now sheltering in crammed UNRWA schools and buildings, with scarce food and water and often nowhere to sleep, he reported.
'Hunger and despair are turning into anger against the international community,' Lazzarini said, adding that the meagre aid allowed in through Egypt starting last week was nowhere near sufficient.
Israel began   into Gaza on October 21, but in-depth inspections of each convoy have caused lengthy delays. Israel has also categorically refused to allow fuel to be shipped in, leaving the enclave's few   at risk of closure.
'Last remaining lifeline'
On Sunday, Palestinians, desperate due to continued blockade and bombing,  UN warehouses, taking wheat, flour, and other basic survival goods.
'A further breakdown in civil order will make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the largest UN agency in Gaza to continue operating, ' Lazzarini warned the UNSC assembly.
'I say this while being fully aware that UNRWA is the last remaining lifeline for the Palestinian people in Gaza,' he added.

To increase the flow of much-needed aid, UN officials have urged Israel to open up Karem Abu Salem, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, border crossing with Gaza, saying it is the only passage equipped to take in enough trucks. Israel has so far refused to open any of its  with the enclave, on which it has imposed a land, air, and sea blockade for 16 years.
'This cannot be collateral damage'
UN officials also emphasised the skyrocketing casualties in Gaza, particularly among children, a toll unparalleled by even the most bloody contemporary conflicts.
'More than 420 children are being killed or injured in Gaza each day — a number which should shake each of us to our core,' said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.
Lazzarini added: 'This surpasses the number of children killed annually across the world's conflict zones since 2019,' stressing, 'This cannot be 'collateral damage'.'
Israel has warned that even greater danger looms as it intensifies a ground offensive into the enclave. It has ordered people in Gaza to evacuate to the southern part of the territory or risk being treated as "terrorist accomplices'.
However, Palestinians in Gaza have not found safety in the south either, where Israel has   homes.
'I have said many times, and I will say it again 'no place is safe in Gaza',' said Lazzarini.
His plea to the UNSC came after the body failed to pass four separate resolutions calling for a ceasefire or 'humanitarian pauses'. One was  by the United States, and another by Russia and China. The others failed to get the minimum nine votes.
On Friday, the UN General Assembly   in favour of a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian truce, but its resolution is non-binding. The US and Israel were among 14 countries to vote against the resolution.
The emergency summit also voiced concern over the prospect that the war in Gaza risks spiralling into a broader regional conflagration.
Geir Pedersen, the UN's special envoy to Syria,' said spillover into Syria had already begun and raised 'a terrifying prospect of a potential wider escalation'.
Israel has conducted numerous air raids in Syria and Lebanon as well since its war with Hamas broke out three weeks ago,  at critical military infrastructure and airports.

'Mr President, put an end to this': Palestinian Americans speak out on Gaza

Washington, DC - Arab, Muslim and Palestinian rights advocates in the United States have denounced Washington's unconditional support for Israel's  , decrying the "dehumanisation" of Palestinians by media outlets and politicians.
Speaking at a news conference on Friday, representatives of several advocacy groups also sounded the alarm about the prospect of hate incidents against Arab and Muslim Americans.
Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), slammed President Joe Biden, accusing him of failing to recognise the Palestinians' humanity.
"You are not helping," Awad said, speaking as if he were addressing Biden himself. "You are, in fact, giving the green light for Israel to commit a genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. You failed us as American citizens. You failed us as Palestinians. And you failed the world community."
Biden, a self-described Zionist, has consistently   for Israel. In a speech this week, the president pledged to ensure that Israel has the military needs to "defend itself", while barely mentioning the Palestinian civilians under bombardment in Gaza.
"We call on you, Mr President, to put an end to this violence. You have the ability and power to prevent a mass crime and genocide from happening," Awad said.
The war erupted on October 7 when the Palestinian group Hamas launched a   against Israel from the besieged Gaza Strip, killing hundreds of people and taking dozens captive.
Israel responded with a bombing campaign that has killed nearly 1,900 Palestinians, including more than 500 children in Gaza. Israeli authorities have also announced a total blockade on Gaza, preventing fuel and other basic supplies from entering the territory.
In addition, Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Israel of using   in violation of international law, which prohibits the use of the highly incendiary munition in populated areas like Gaza, a narrow strip of land home to 2.3 million people.
Early on Friday, Israel ordered more than 1.1 million Palestinians there — nearly half of the territory's population —   within 24 hours, sparking further outrage from rights groups.
At the news conference in Washington, DC, Awad, who is Palestinian American, stressed the need to address the historical context of the conflict.
Leading rights groups, like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have said Israel is imposing a system of apartheid on Palestinians.
"History did not start on October 7," Awad said, referring to the Hamas attack. He called Gaza the world's largest open-air prison, a frequent criticism among rights advocates who denounce Israel's efforts to restrict movement to and from the territory and detain its residents.
Awad added that Palestinians have been "subjugated to all kinds of violence, discrimination, ethnic cleansing" for decades.
Awad underscored the killing of two US citizens by Israel last year — Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and elderly Palestinian American man   — saying their lives did not matter to the US government.
"We, as Muslims and Palestinians and Americans, we believe that every human life is valuable and sacred and has to be protected," Awad said.
For his part, Chris Habiby, director of national government affairs and advocacy at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), said the US should be calling for immediate de-escalation to stop the violence.
Instead, he said, "our elected leaders are perpetuating Israeli lies, calling for a religious war and openly advocating for the destruction of the second most densely populated place on planet Earth".
Several US politicians have called for unchecked violence against Gaza. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News earlier this week, "We're in a religious war here. I am with Israel. Do whatever the hell you have to do to defend yourself. Level the place."
We're in a religious war and I unapologetically Stand with Israel. pic.twitter.com/AQDY4ELrmJ
- Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 11, 2023
Habiby said that such rhetoric has led to a "culture of fear" in Arab-American communities. He cited incidents of assault against Palestine solidarity demonstrators across the country.
"In New York City, they're waving the flag of a Jewish  ," he said, referring to the Jewish Defense League, an ultranationalist group suspected of carrying out violent attacks against Arab and Palestinian Americans.
"We need our elected leaders to stand up and remember the humanity of people, the humanity of Palestinians. This is not a one-sided affair here. We need to do better," he said.
Ayah Ziyadeh, advocacy director at American Muslims for Palestine, also accused US politicians of demonising Palestinians to give Israel cover to commit its "horrendous crimes".
"The root causes of this violence are clear. It is decades of Israeli military occupation   and US complicity," she said.

Turkey recalls ambassador to Israel over 'humanitarian tragedy in Gaza'

November 4th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Turkey says it has recalled its ambassador to Israel for consultations over Israel's sustained bombing of civilians in the Gaza Strip and the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the besieged enclave.
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that Sakir Ozkan Torunlar was being recalled "in view of the unfolding humanitarian tragedy in Gaza caused by the continuing attacks by Israel against civilians and   and the continuous and unhindered flow of humanitarian aid.'
The move comes as Ankara's rhetoric is becoming increasingly critical of Israel, which has killed about 9,500 Palestinians, including 3,900 children, in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 attacks by Hamas, which killed about 1,400 people.
On Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he was breaking off contact with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
'Netanyahu is no longer someone we can talk to. We have written him off,' Turkish media quoted Erdogan as saying. But he added that this does not mean Turkey is cutting its relations with Israel and his intelligence chief is in contact with Israeli and Palestinian authorities as well as Hamas.
Turkey hosts members of Hamas, which it does not consider a 'terrorist' organisation like the United States and the European Union. It has called for an immediate ceasefire, unlike Western governments.
Erdogan also said that when the war is over, Turkey wants 'to see Gaza as a peaceful region that is a part of an independent Palestinian state, in line with 1967 borders, with territorial integrity, and with East Jerusalem as its capital'.
Last month, Israeli diplomats had left Turkey for security reasons after many pro-Palestinian demonstrations erupted across the country. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs later said it had recalled the diplomats to assess the state of bilateral relations.
According to Erdogan, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi will visit Turkey at the end of November. Erdogan also plans this month to attend a summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Riyadh to discuss a ceasefire in Gaza with regional actors.
Even as international calls for a ceasefire in Gaza grow, Netanyahu has refused any such prospects as the Israeli military pushes into Gaza on the ground and continues to bomb it.
Humanitarian aid   from the Rafah crossing, the only passage into the enclave not controlled by Israel, but rights organisations continue to warn that the humanitarian situation is dire.

August 30th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
A Palestinian teenager has been shot and killed by Israeli forces in occupied East Jerusalem, after Israeli police alleged that he had attempted a stabbing attack at a light rail station.
Wednesday's incident reportedly took place near Damascus Gate in Jerusalem's Old City. The Palestinian Wafa news agency identified the child as 15-year-old Khaled Samer al-Zaanin.
It said the Palestinian al-Zaanin was 'assaulted' by illegal Jewish settlers and security personnel, according to witnesses.
A border police officer 'directly shot towards the child, killing him in cold blood', Wafa said.
The settler who was allegedly attacked suffered light injuries, it added.
Israeli police said 'the suspect was neutralised on the spot", without elaborating.
A border police officer who was travelling in a train saw the reported attack as it happened and took action, the police said. He "promptly disembarked from the train and fired", hitting the suspect, they said.
A police spokesman told AFP news agency the attacker was a "minor" from East Jerusalem, but he did not specify the attacker's age.
Police later raided al-Zaanin's family home in the village of Beit Hanina, north of East Jerusalem, Wafa reported.
Israeli forces often conduct near-daily pre-dawn raids into the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in an attempt to crack down on growing armed resistance.
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed this year in the occupied Palestinian territories, and the United Nations has warned that 2023 is on track to be the deadliest year for Palestinians since it started recording fatalities.
Palestinian and international rights groups have long condemned  what they see as a policy of "shoot to kill" and excessive use of force.

'It's time to go': When a Palestinian maths class becomes a victim of war

October 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Beit Sahour, occupied West Bank — At 7:30am last Saturday, students said goodbye to their parents and greeted their friends in the school yard. The sky over the Palestinian town of Beit Sahour, east of Bethlehem, was eerily clear.
They talked about their upcoming exams, the latest gossip, and made plans to hang out after school. Each grade formed a neat line facing the school's entrance where the principal made morning announcements over a microphone. Before running for the first period, students and teachers placed their hands over their hearts for the school anthem that crackled through the speaker.
Class began promptly at 7:50am, following a schedule that would soon be disrupted. At 8:20am, the first of several loud sounds confirmed the news coming through teachers' phones of missiles leaving Gaza. At 8:30am, the bell rang. The second period began as usual.
As students raised their hands to answer maths problems and read from their English textbooks, teachers shared messages they were receiving from family members that had yet to reach news outlets. There was urgency, but not panic. This was not a new headline in Palestine.
At 8:45am, the school administration sent an official notice instructing parents to pick up their children, 'to preserve their safety'.
The news spread through word of mouth. Students put their pencils down, packed their bags, and flooded into the hallways. It was reminiscent of a fire drill, but less organised — and with much higher stakes.
In the faculty lounge, a teacher pointed outside as smoke rose up from the nearby horizon. As more details of the attack came through, a   spread among those still inside the school.
'It's time to go,' another teacher affirmed.
'Asra! Asra!' A male voice bellowed outside. 'Faster! Faster!'
Seventh grader Lina asked me if I knew why we were being sent home. 'It's your first time, isn't it?'
She explained that war was a  , and disturbance.
'How are you feeling?' I redirected the conversation, uncomfortable with a 12-year-old consoling me.
'I don't have feelings.' She laughed. 'I don't care if I die.'
The news reached maths teacher Sirine in the middle of a ninth-grade exam. Her first thought was that her worst fear was coming true — that her children would live through war, too.
Sirine attended the same school as a child, succeeded by her children — fourth grader Ihab, nine, and sixth grader Maya, 11.
Sirine's high school years coincided with the   (2000-05). She finished Tawjihi in 2002, the final year of high school in Palestine spent preparing for a series of standardised exams that determine university placement. Her exam period was defined by the Israeli siege on the Nativity Church, when about 200 Palestinians took refuge from the advancing army between April 2 and May 10, 2002.
Sirine, the student, too was in the middle of her maths exam that year when Israeli forces declared a curfew. 'Mamnooa al-tajawol,' Sirine repeated the words with which the soldiers interrupted her exam. 'No one is allowed to move.'
'The teachers told us to continue no matter what is happening outside,' she recalled. When they finished the exam, a government vehicle with special permission to move during curfew drove the students home.That year, many students were forced to postpone their Tawjihi exams because of the siege.
Without the Intifada, Sirine would have gone to Birzeit University and studied architecture. But her parents wanted her to stay close to home, so she studied mathematics at Bethlehem University instead. The war changed the course of her life, an experience her children are living for the first time.
Her son Ihab was excited when he heard the news of Saturday's events, hoping this meant a free Palestine.
Sirine chuckled. 'Not yet, Mama.'
Ihab admitted that he and his sister, Maya, were afraid when they heard the loud noises outside.
'I was happy to have a day off from school,' Maya said, 'but I felt sad because there were many loud alarms and bombs.'
Ihab and Maya have been sent home from school before, during strikes or after the news of a Palestinian killing, often called shaheed, a martyr. But this was the first time they were sent home for war.
They spent the afternoon talking to their friends on the phone, sending videos and news updates in group chats. Sirine mentioned that these videos were often graphic and violent, but Maya reassured her mom that they didn't frighten her. 'A'adi,' she said, loosely translating to, 'it's something we have gotten used to.'
Maya expressed concerns about the effect of the war on her education. When she misses school, she cannot study, she complained. 'We can defend our country with our knowledge,' Maya added, 'by being educated.'
Sirine agreed with her daughter. Through her work as a teacher, Sirine hopes to create a generation that can build a stronger Palestine.
'This is my method of defence.'
With no signs of de-escalation, the school plans to transition to online learning for the first time since the pandemic. Sirine is concerned that, once again, students will miss key concepts and necessary communication skills.
'I want my children, my students to live a normal life.'
'The people are really afraid,' Sirine said. 'We can't leave Bethlehem — Al-Jisr [the Allenby Bridge] is closed. The airport is closed. Everything is closed.'
And for an economy dependent on tourism, she added, this war will mean that thousands of families will struggle to meet their needs. 'People are not prepared for this.'
'I am living through what I lived at three years old,' Sirine said of her upbringing during the first Intifada. When she couldn't say the words better herself, she turned to Palestinian poet and writer Mahmoud Darwish: 'Palestine,' she said, 'Peace to a land created for peace, yet has never seen a day of peace in its life."

'This is different': At a West Bank cafe, the war edges closer

Beit Sahour, occupied West Bank – The Citadel sits in the old city of Beit Sahour – a restaurant, coffee shop and community centre. Throughout the year, it is a revolving door of local regulars, tourists and foreigners who call the Bethlehem area home.
The outdoor patio, slightly below ground level, looks at two walls branded with signatures of Palestinian resistance. One is covered by paintings of icons, from Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akhleh to activist Khader Adnan. The other bears quotes, in Arabic and English.
'If we fail to defend our just cause, then we should change the defenders, not the cause,' the wall reads in tribute to Palestinian writer Ghassan Kanafani.
As the sun set on the  , tourists had left and few foreigners remained, but regulars stayed stationed in front of ashtrays on intricately engraved coffee tables, trading news and life updates simultaneously.
Baha Hilu, the organiser of cultural and political events at the Citadel, had had a long day. He wore a knit wool cap and a T-shirt in a matching olive green colour, the words 'Intifada 48' written on the back like a sports jersey. He spoke in poignant one-liners informed by his sociological background, but more importantly, by his ability to articulate the structures of oppression that shape the life of a Palestinian.
His day started by arranging an anxious Swiss tour group's departure after they found themselves trapped in the middle of the conflict, amid mounting apprehensions that the cloud of war that has already enveloped the Gaza Strip could soon  .
At 8am he had loaded them into a Palestinian white-plated bus that left from Bethlehem to a checkpoint east of the city. The checkpoint, miraculously open, was where the group switched to an Israeli yellow-plated bus that would take them to the Jordan crossing – the Ben Gurion airport was no longer an option. As Baha drove away, he watched Israeli forces intercept the bus and close the checkpoint after it passed through.
Later that day, he heard the news from a friend in Gaza City – she and her family lost their home in the Israeli bombing. They were now displaced people. Homeless.
By the time he sat down, it was nearly 6pm. Baha was tired – physically, mentally and emotionally. The whole world was looking at him, at Palestine, he said, but they couldn't see him at all.
'This is different,' was the one statement that stayed consistent among conversations in the Citadel.
Baha agreed – he had never seen Israeli soldiers captured by Palestinians before. Yet, he pointed out, 'the outcome is always the same'.

He spoke to the conception that Palestinians are 'used to this' – to war. 'We are survivors of Israeli apartheid. It is applied to the best of us and to the worst of us,' he said. 'We are   to the point where death is more merciful than life.'
'Every Palestinian killed is a miracle wasted,' he said, rubbing his temple with one hand, holding a cigarette in the other.
Nineteen-year-old Maryam shared a similar sentiment. 'People make it seem like we're used to war, but we're not,' she said. 'I was supposed to start university in Haifa next week.' Her silver earrings swung back and forth as she shook her head.
'I guess that's not happening.'
Nader, Taha, Ibrahim and Malik sat around a nearby table. They picked from a bag of Mr Chips, paprika flavoured, and Lay's. Packs of Marlboro, Parliament and Gauloises were depleting fast.
'Don't worry,' Ibrahim reassured, unlike gasoline, water, and canned goods, they were sure they wouldn't run out of tobacco.
As the night went on, more people sat down at the Citadel. The conversation continued in a growing circle. A young woman from Romania, who had arrived in Bethlehem only three weeks earlier, spoke up. She was working for an NGO documenting Israeli crimes of international law and on a three-month stay.
'My parents are freaking out, but I want to stay,' she said. 'For as long as I can.'
She added that many of her foreign friends had already left. She was living alone.
A voice from across the circle suggested a game night at the Citadel the next day. Everyone was excited about the idea and offered to bring a different board game or deck of cards. Even poker was on the table.
'The buy-in is 200 shekels,' Baha joked, the equivalent of $50. The group groaned in unison, suggesting that the loser buys a pack of cigarettes instead. Yes, they agreed, it was decided.
As the conversation continued, Nader and Ibrahim watched a live video on TikTok of scenes unfolding less than 10 minutes away, at Jacir Palace, a major hotel. People crowded around the phone watching a jagged line of fire spread across the street. Everyone had been there before, everyone knew someone who lived within a quarter-mile radius, if it wasn't themselves. Gunshots rang out on the screen. Eyes bulged as a man fell to the ground at the hands of Israeli forces.
Minutes later, phones lit up with notifications from WhatsApp and Telegram news-update group chats.
'19:54hrs, WB, Bethlehem: a Palestinian was seriously injured during ongoing clashes with IF in front of [Jacir] palace / Rachel tomb 300 checkpoint. Avoid the area.'
'Would the situation escalate in the West Bank?' It's a question many of those at the Citadel wondered out loud. Already, isolated incidents like the one at Jacir Palace were steadily increasing.
'This is nothing,' Taha said of what had happened so far. 'This is only a snack.'

Is 'total' Gaza blockade a collective punishment against Palestinians?

October 9th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israel has announced a total blockade of the Gaza Strip two days after fighters from the Hamas group carried out deadly attacks inside Israel, killing at least 800 people and taking dozens captive.
'We are putting a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no gas - it's all closed,' Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a video statement on Monday, justifying the move by describing Palestinians as "beastly people".
More than 500 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 3,000 injured in Israeli strikes that have targeted residential buildings and offices in the enclave – home to 2.3 million people.
The decision to cut electricity, water and fuel supplies to Gaza, which has already been under an Israeli siege for 16 years, has been condemned by the United Nations as a  .
Fears of a ground invasion of Gaza are growing after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was "at war" in the wake of the worst attacks in decades.
(Al Jazeera)
Intense bombardments in Gaza
More than 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced and thousands have taken shelter in UN schools as Israeli attacks intensify, forcing Palestinians to flee their homes.
Buildings, mosques and offices have been targeted as Netanyahu promised "mighty vengeance" for the deadly attacks that has sent shockwaves across Israel.
Harrowing images from inside Gaza have emerged with 19 members of a family killed when an air strike on Sunday hit their residential building. More than 60 percent of Gaza's population are refugees who were ethnically cleansed from their homes currently in Israel.
Isn't Gaza already under a blockade?
Israel has maintained a land, sea and air blockade on Gaza since 2007, a year after Hamas was democratically elected into power. The voting came nearly two years after Israeli troops and settlers withdrew from the enclave.
The blockade gives Israel control of Gaza's borders, and Egypt has stepped in to enforce the western border.
Israel has stated it has blocked the borders to protect its citizens from Hamas, but the act of collective punishment violates the Geneva Conventions and has long been considered illegal by groups including the International Committee of the Red Cross.
(Al Jazeera)
"Collective punishment has been clearly forbidden under international humanitarian law through Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. No exceptions are permitted," Michael Lynk, the UN's special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, stated in his 2020 report.
The report further said: 'Israel's collective punishment policy' of Gaza has created a 'completely collapsed economy, devastated infrastructure and a barely functioning social service system'.
"While Israel's justification for imposing the closure on Gaza was to contain Hamas and ensure Israel's security, the actual impact of the closure has been the destruction of Gaza's economy, causing immeasurable suffering to its two million inhabitants."
Is this the first time Israel has used collective punishment against Gaza?
Israel has been accused of using collective punishment before and creating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. It's a strategy often used by Israel when dealing with Palestinians, effectively punishing the masses for the actions of a few.
Lynk, however, has stated: "Only the guilty can be punished for their acts, and only after a fair process. The innocent can never be made to be punished for the deeds of others."
What forms of collective punishment has Israel used in the past?
Apart from border controls, Israel has demolished homes, imposed curfews, created roadblocks, confiscated personal property, destroyed agricultural land and water systems.
The effects of its 16-year blockade has created   of more than 45 percent, one of the highest in the world. Only 13 hours of electricity per day have been available to residents in Gaza in 2023, according to the UN. Palestinians in Gaza also have poor access to clean water and no functioning airports.

Palestinian dies month after being shot during Israeli raid in West Bank

The Palestinian news agency has reported that a 20-year-old has died of wounds a month after being shot during an 
The WAFA news agency said on Saturday that Ezzedin Kanan, from the town of Jaba near Jenin, was shot in the head on July 3 during   in the occupied West Bank since an armed Palestinian uprising against Israel's open-ended occupation ended two decades ago.
An offshoot of the secular nationalist Fatah party, the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, claimed Kanan as one of its "fiercest fighters" and pledged to avenge his loss.
Armed and masked fighters flanked the mourning procession for Kanan as his body, wrapped in a Palestinian flag and adorned with a headband from the group, was carried through his home village of Jaba.
Kanan's death brings the total to 14 people killed in the raid, which lasted two days and included air attacks, hundreds of ground troops and bulldozers that were used to raze roads and buildings.
The army claimed to have inflicted heavy damage on fighter groups in the Jenin refugee camp and that it had confiscated thousands of weapons, bomb-making materials and caches of money during the raid.
Since early 2022, Israel has been carrying out near-daily raids in the West Bank in response to a series of Palestinian attacks. It says the raids are meant to crack down on Palestinian fighters and said they are necessary because the Palestinian Authority is too weak.
The continuing violence in the West Bank has surged with more than 170 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire since the start of 2023, according to a tally by The Associated Press.
Palestinians say such violence is the inevitable result of 56 years of illegal occupation and the absence of any political process with Israel. They also point to   in the West Bank and violence by settlers.
The United Nations Middle East envoy told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that the upswing in violence is being fuelled by growing despair about the future, with the Palestinians still seeking an independent state.
"The lack of progress towards a political horizon that addressed the core issues driving the conflict has left a dangerous and volatile vacuum, filled by extremists on all sides," Tor Wennesland said.
On Saturday, Palestinian daily newspapers also highlighted confrontations in occupied East Jerusalem during the week including an attack on Muslim worshippers on their way to attend Friday prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque as well as the suppression of a weekly protest in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood.
Israel captured the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and Gaza, in 1967. Since then, it has built settlements housing hundreds of thousands of Israelis on the occupied lands, which Palestinians seek as part of their future state.
International law explicitly prohibits occupying powers from transferring their civilian population into occupied territories. A UN expert has previously called Israeli settlements a '  '.

US to hike military aid, send military ships and aircraft closer to Israel

The United States has said it will send multiple military ships and aircraft closer to Israel as a show of support following Saturday's surprise attack  by the Palestinian armed group  .
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday said Washington will also increase military aid and provide munitions to Israel.
Hamas has labelled the US announcement as "aggression" against Palestinians.
"The announcement of the US that it will provide an aircraft carrier to support the occupation [Israel] is actual participation in the aggression against our people," the group said in a statement.
Israel battered Palestinians with air strikes in the besieged Gaza Strip on Sunday, with   on both sides.
Austin said the US believes Hamas's latest attack could also be aimed at disrupting a potential normalising of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Austin said the security assistance to Israel will begin moving on Sunday and that the US will be adding fighter jets to the region as well.
The US has also ordered the moving of a carrier strike group closer to Israel, which includes the Ford carrier and ships that support it.
"I have directed the movement of the USS Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Eastern Mediterranean," Austin said in a statement.
US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday that additional assistance for the Israeli army was on its way.
US Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, held a call with Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, said the US contributes $3bn a year in military aid to Israel.
"I have been told that among the munitions will be a support for [Israel's] Iron Dome system… that is an intercept system for missiles and rockets being fired into Israel, which failed spectacularly on Saturday morning," he said.

Earlier on Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the CNN network that "it wouldn't be a surprise that part of the motivation [for Hamas's attack] may have been to disrupt efforts to bring Saudi Arabia and Israel together, along with other countries that may be interested in normalising relations with Israel".
Hamas on Saturday said its attack was driven by what it called escalated Israeli attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, Jerusalem and in  .
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh had highlighted threats to Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, the continuation of an Israeli blockade on Gaza and Israeli normalisation with countries in the region.
Netanyahu last month said he believed his countrywas on the cuspof peace with Saudi Arabia, predicting that the move could reshape the Middle East.
Saudi Arabia has long insisted on the Palestinians' right to statehood as a condition for recognising Israel, something many members of Netanyahu's nationalist religious coalition have long resisted.
The US on Sunday said the Saudi-Israel normalisation efforts should continue despite the latest attack.
"We think it would be in both countries' interests to continue to pursue this possibility," US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told Fox News.

Collective punishment of millions in Gaza not justified: Humza Yousaf

October 11th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf, whose parents-in-law are trapped in the Gaza Strip amid intense Israeli air attacks, has called for a humanitarian corridor to allow vital supplies into the besieged enclave and people to leave.
In an interview with Al Jazeera on Wednesday, Yousaf said his family received a message from his mother-in-law telling them that they were alive after a 'terrifying night'.
'The situation is absolutely dire, and that is why I've spent the last 24 hours calling for a humanitarian corridor to be set up to allow vital supplies to come into Gaza and to allow also the safe passage of people from Gaza to leave," said Yousaf, whose wife is Palestinian. "Because they are being told to leave, but they have nowhere to go."
Bombardments on Gaza intensified overnight as Israel ramped up attacks following Hamas's surprise land and air attack on Saturday morning.

The death toll from Hamas's attacks has surpassed 1,200, with more than 2,700 injured, according to the Israeli military.
Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 1,055 people and wounded 5,184 others, according to Palestinian officials.
The Israeli military has announced a 'full siege' of the enclave, including a ban on incoming food, water and fuel.
The United Nations' human rights chief, Volker Turk, has denounced Israel's move and said a siege is 'prohibited under international law'.
Palestinians have been unable to leave Gaza freely since the imposition of a land, air and sea blockade in 2007, despite warnings from Israel to leave the enclave in advance of its attacks.
(Al Jazeera)
'I'll give you my own family's example,' said Yousaf.
'Yesterday morning, my mother-in-law and father-in-law were told that the Rafah border may well be opened for them and as, of course, the border controlled by Egypt, they may be able to get out.
'They were about to get in the car when they were told that Rafah had been bombed and that the crossing was closed indefinitely,' he said.
Yousaf added that while he 'completely understands' why Israel wants to protect itself, the price cannot be the 'collective punishment of two million people'.
The UN has said more than 180,000 Palestinians have been made homeless after strikes levelled apartment buildings in once densely populated areas.
Gaza's sole power plant also said on Wednesday that fuel had run out, placing further strain on already stretched medical facilities, which face being plunged into darkness.
Yousaf appealed to other leaders to highlight the conflict's inequality.
'What we need leaders to do, whether they are in the West or wherever they are across the world, is to treat an Israeli life and a Palestinian life as equal," he said.
"The collective punishment of over two million people in Gaza – men, women and children – simply cannot be justified."

Gaza Strip – As the Israeli bombs thundered and shook the world around them, Sara al-Khalidi and her four children clung to each other on the floor of their living room in Gaza City's Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood, trembling with fear.
The explosions did not stop all night, creating what Sara said was a fire belt in the area.
"At that moment, I thought that if the house was hit by a severe bombing, my children would die, and no one would be able to identify them," the 40-year-old said. "I was afraid of this idea."
The family survived the night and the next day made their way south to Khan Younis to stay at a relative's house where they thought they would be safer. However, Sara was shocked to see members of her extended family writing the names of their children on their bodies.
The idea made her cry and she worried that if she did the same then she would be bringing bad luck to her children.
But after seeing one of the doctors at al-Shifa Hospital writing the children's names on their bodies, Sara changed her mind.
"The world should know about these children who were murdered by Israel because they are not numbers, but names, stories and dreams killed by the Israeli occupation in Gaza," she said.

Over the past three weeks, Israel's relentless bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, one of the world's most densely populated areas, has wrought dizzying levels of carnage. More than 7,300 Palestinians have been killed, including about 3,000 children. A further 1,650 Palestinians remain trapped under the rubble of their homes and buildings, half of them children.
On Friday night, Israel also cut off all communication services in Gaza, sparking concerns of potential war crimes carried out under the cover of an  .
The offensive began after a surprise attack by Hamas on October 7, when its fighters killed 1,400 people in southern Israel after they stormed army outposts and towns surrounding the Gaza Strip.
In addition to imposing a total blockade on the coastal enclave, where fuel, clean water and electricity have run out, Israeli warplanes have also targeted critical infrastructure. More than 200,000 housing units have been partially or wholly destroyed.
According to the United Nations, 1.4 million Palestinians – more than half of the total population of Gaza – have been internally displaced, following the heavy bombings along with warnings from the Israeli military to those living in northern Gaza to flee to the south. Yet Palestinians say that nowhere is safe, as the indiscriminate bombings have targeted the entire strip – not just the north.

'Afraid of losing all our children'
Writing the names of children on their arms or legs is an attempt to bring the families closure in case their children are killed so that they are able to bury them in marked graves as opposed to mass graves.
Some doctors have pointed out that the burns they have seen on the bodies of Palestinians killed are unlike any they have seen, indicating Israel may be using internationally banned munitions. Other bodies have been torn apart in Israeli air attacks on their homes, making it difficult for surviving relatives to identify them.
The health ministry in Gaza, which released a 212-page report of the names of the Palestinians killed, said that there are 200 bodies which have been mangled beyond recognition, and are, therefore, impossible to identify.
Mohammed Abu Odeh, a resident in Gaza, said he believes that Israel, with its precision weaponry, targets children intentionally.
During the May 2021 offensive, he sent two of his children to his brother and took two of his brother's children, so that in case one of their houses was targeted by Israel, there would be someone left from the other family.
"It was a very painful experience," the 27-year-old from the Shati (Beach) camp said. "We were afraid of losing all of our children."

This time around, Abu Odeh has kept his children together but has written their names on their arms and legs.
"When my children ask me why I'm doing this, I tell them that it is for their safety and protection," he said. "Can anyone in the world bear the thought of what our children are going through?"
As a parent, preparing oneself physically and psychologically for the worst to happen is exhausting, he said. Abu Odeh doesn't have all the answers to the questions his children ask him, whether it's about their friends who have been killed or about how a child's body can withstand the force of a missile.
"I don't know what to tell them," he said. "I lie to them so they can be strong. How can I reassure them when I'm afraid of this devastating war which is robbing us of everything dear and precious? How can I tell them that their bodies are very strong and can defy missiles?"
He says that children deserve a life where they won't have to be buried under rubble, with the sound of bombing above them. He also says parents should not have to live through the painful reality of trying to identify the bodies of their children, which have been disfigured in the most gruesome way by Israeli missiles.
"Writing my children's names on their bodies is the solution so that the world will know them," he said.

'Everyone is a target'
This painful practice is also widespread in many of the United Nations-run schools, where more than 629,000 Palestinians have taken refuge from the bombing.
According to Salwa Khattab, who is now sheltering with her family in one such school, there is no safe place in Gaza, not even in the facilities run by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
"This war is targeting everyone," she said. "We do not feel safe or assured here. Look what Israel did to the school in the al-Maghazi refugee camp … they   and killed a number of displaced people."
Between Wednesday and Thursday, the UN agency  said that three of its schools had sustained collateral damage due to nearby Israeli raids. One displaced person was killed and 15 others sustained minor injuries.
Khattab has gathered her grandchildren and younger children in the classroom they have been staying in and has written their names on their hands and feet.
"I want the world to know them, to mention their names as martyrs killed by Israel without mercy," she said.
Khattab cannot bear to see the images of dead children or their remains and says the aftermath of all of this will be much harder to take.
"Every day I cry over what we are experiencing because of the war," she said. "I hope it will stop and end. Enough is enough."
Mayar Abu Daqqa, who is from the town of Abasan al-Kabira, east of Khan Younis, said she and her fellow students have all written their names on their own bodies.
Even children who have survived bombings are often"in a state of shock and fear and are unable to speak," the 13-year-old said. "That is why we write our names so that you will know us."

'A place to fly' - Jenin Freedom Theatre stands defiant amid Israeli raids

One of the more disturbing things that Ranin Odeh has observed during the activity sessions she runs for children at the Freedom Theatre in the West Bank's Jenin camp is that their play often turns violent. Children frequently become overly rough and even hit each other.
It is a typical trauma response, she says. 'They don't understand why they do it, but I do.' She has often seen children coping with the trauma of Israeli incursions into the camp through violent play. She doesn't allow that kind of play in her setting, offering instead cultural and artistic activities as an alternative way to focus their fear and rage.
With short, black hair and a welcoming presence, Odeh, 30, has the brightness and energy of a young person, but also the tough look of someone who has seen and lived through a great deal. Her job is particularly important to her as someone who remembers growing up during the second Intifada, or uprising. She identifies strongly with the need that children have to heal from trauma through art and play.
Children need safe spaces where they can feel good, she says. 'They need a place where they can fly.'
Life for children in Jenin is traumatic. One day, the kids are having fun with an activity in the Freedom Theatre, says Odeh, and the next, there is an armed raid by Israeli forces on the camp – an event which has become far more frequent since the start of Israel's war on Gaza on October 7.

Facing down Molotov cocktails
The Freedom Theatre itself is no stranger to danger and violence.
Originally called the Stone Theatre, it was founded in 1987, after the first Intifada, by Arna Mer-Khamis, an Israeli activist who died in 1995. Mer-Khamis was born into a Jewish family in 1929 and became a lifelong supporter of the rights of Palestinians, especially children. With her theatre, she hoped to offer children a space for healing and to empower women through the theatre and arts.
The first building which housed the theatre was destroyed in 2002 by Israeli forces during the second Intifada. In 2006, Juliano Mer-Khamis, Arna's son by her Palestinian Christian husband, Saliba Khamis, reopened the theatre on a new site in Jenin, doubling as a community centre.
Not everyone was in favour, however. In 2009, an unidentified person threw two Molotov cocktail bombs at the theatre while it was empty. Juliano was   by a masked attacker in Jenin in 2011 at the age of 52. His murder was never solved.
Amid the latest crisis, Mustafa Sheta, the tall, broad director of the theatre, says he begins each day in the knowledge that probably nothing he has planned will actually happen.
Sheta has an inviting smile, engaging intensely with you when he talks about his theatre or about Israel's war on Gaza and frequent raids on the occupied West Bank. These days, that is nearly every time the 43-year-old speaks to visitors at the Freedom Theatre in the Jenin refugee camp, situated in the West Bank.

Two weeks ago – between November 6 and 10 – multiple Israeli military incursions took place in and around Jenin. On November 9, a Thursday, Sheta and theatre staff were inside when   by Israeli forces took place from midnight until Friday dawn and resumed mid-morning. There was heavy fighting, accompanied by Israeli drone attacks.
Before the big push into Jenin began on Thursday night, there had already been some attacks by Israeli forces during the day. In the evening, the electricity to the camp was cut off and Israeli forces used loudhailers to announce a two-hour window for civilians to evacuate the camp.
That night, children, women and men with flashlights or the light of their mobile phones walked to the Jenin hospital, waiting for the raid to restart. During the night, many children were trapped inside schools in the camp, waiting for the incursion to end so they could be reunited with their families. Fourteen Palestinians, some of whom were fighters, were killed.

Resistance through art
Given the likelihood of armed incursions, therefore, the theatre staff begin each day trying to find out if there is going to be an attack on the camp; Sheta says he needs to know if his audience, his four children – two boys and two girls – his staff and their families will be safe.
It is very difficult to organise regular programmes and he always has to have a plan B. But this is his method of resistance, he says. Indeed, 'resistance through art' is the motto of the theatre.
'We also struggle in the fight to free Palestine,' Sheta says. He believes there are many ways to contribute to Palestinian resistance to the Israeli occupation – armed struggle is just one.
Sheta considers himself a 'cultural fighter' but he has not escaped the effects of violence. His father, a high school teacher, was killed by Israeli troops in 2002 in Jenin just one month before Sheta graduated from college – one of his dreams for his children.
Sheta has also been arrested in the past, and has spent eight months in two Israeli prisons, accused of 'inciting violence'. He saw that as an opportunity to learn more about the plight of Palestinian prisoners. 'The violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, particularly in Jenin, did not start on October 7,' he says.
Mostly, however, he believes in the importance of preserving Palestinian culture and establishing an identity for his people which goes beyond the occupation. 'It is time to invest in Palestinian culture. The struggle has to come with many steps, not only with guns.'

Israel's army meets fierce resistance 'at the gates of Gaza City'

November 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Israeli troops have   towards Gaza City, the enclave's largest population centre, but are facing tough opposition from Palestinian fighters in the fight for the city as the total death toll in Gaza exceeds 9,000.
Fighters of Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) jump out of tunnels to fire at incoming Israeli tanks, before slipping back into their vast underground network, residents said and videos from both groups showed on Thursday.
The guerrilla-style combat has forced Israel, which often utilises its powerful air force to hit Hamas hideouts from above, into a ground war as it seeks to overthrow the Palestinian group entirely.
The Israeli military on Thursday said it had lost the commander of its 53rd battalion in the fighting, bringing the total number of Israeli soldiers killed since it intensified its ground raid to 18.
The commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Salman Habaka, is believed to be the most senior Israeli officer killed since ground operations began in late October.
Israel said it had also killed dozens of Palestinian fighters in the offensive.
As the casualties grow, the war is also drawing closer to Gaza's northern population hub, where Israel has ordered citizens to evacuate from or risk being seen as "terrorist accomplices'.
Israel has continued to pound the area with air raids, as military officials said they were amassing troops "at the gates of Gaza City".
Hamas 'well-prepared'
Israel acknowledged that Hamas was "well-prepared' for the battle, citing "minefields and booby traps' that were making access to the city difficult.
"This is certainly terrain that is more heavily sown than in the past with minefields and booby traps," Brigadier-General Iddo Mizrahi, chief of Israel's military engineers, told Army Radio. "Hamas has learned and prepared itself well," he said.
Multiple axes
One Gaza City resident told Reuters news agency that Israel shelled the city all through Wednesday night but could not encroach city limits.
"In the morning, we [discovered] the Israeli forces are still outside the city, in the outskirts and that means the resistance is heavier than they expected,' said the resident, who asked not to be named.
Ejaz Haider, foreign affairs and military analyst, told Al Jazeera that the Israeli army is moving along multiple axes to surround where they assume Hamas fighters are.
"One idea could be, given how many reserves they have called up, to not just saturate the area with firepower, which they have done through the air and through artillery fire, but to also saturate the area with troops,'Haider told Al Jazeera.
"For Hamas, bringing them in is where they will be able to inflict maximum damage, at least in theory, on the incoming Israeli troops,' he added.
Attack on refugee camp
As Israel presses towards Gaza City, it has also carried out air attacks on the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp, claiming to target Hamas's Qassam Brigades leaders hiding there.
Gaza's authorities said at least 195 Palestinians were killed in the two hits on Tuesday and Wednesday, with at least 777 people injured and 120 others missing.
"It is a massacre," said one person on the scene quoted by Reuters.
Israel said it had killed two Qassam Brigades leaders in Jabalia.
The latest war between Israel and Hamas broke out when the Palestinian group staged a surprise assault on Israeli territory. Israel says the group killed about 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
Israel's ensuing bombardment of the enclave has killed more than 9,000 people, including more than 3,700 children, Gaza authorities say, while decimating the territory's infrastructure and displacing hundreds of thousands.
Attacks 'amount to war crimes'
The growing death toll and dire humanitarian conditions are drawing increased criticism from world leaders, activists, and international bodies.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recently expressed concern that Israel's "disproportionate attacks … could amount to war crimes".
Even the United States, Israel's staunchest ally that has offered unwavering support to it during the war and proposed a $14.3bn emergency aid package for its military, has begun to urge for caution.
"I think we need a pause,'   US President Joe Biden in a speech on Wednesday.
In a renewed diplomatic push, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on Thursday scheduled for his third visit to Israel since the war began.
Blinken plans to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday to offer support, but also to drive home the need to protect civilians as much as possible, his spokesperson said.
Exit route for foreigners, wounded
After a total blockade of Gaza for more than three weeks, foreign passport holders and some severely wounded people were being allowed out as part of an Egypt-mediated deal.
Palestinian border official Wael Abu Mehsen said 400 foreign citizens would leave for Egypt via the Rafah crossing on Thursday after at least 320 people left Gaza on Wednesday.
Another 60 critically injured Palestinians would be crossing too, Mehsen added.
A woman waiting to pass through the Rafah border crossing told Al Jazeera that people in Gaza were "living in agony".
"I need a response from any [Egyptian] official. I have been here since the day the crossing point was shelled weeks ago," she said.
"I was scheduled to leave 20 days ago. That is too much; we are living in agony. We were all close to death,' she said, with her Egyptian passport in hand.

'Nothing standing': Palestinians return to find Gaza homes destroyed

Some Palestinians returned to their homes in the central and northern parts of the Gaza Strip after a   came into effect.
But for many, only rubble waited where their homes once stood.
Al Jazeera's Hisham Zaqout visited the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza on Saturday, where he spoke to several Palestinians who used the pause in fighting to return to their neighbourhoods - only to find utter destruction.
'Our home is destroyed, nothing remains standing. And most of the ducks and chickens were eaten by hungry street dogs,' an elderly woman said.
'This is not a war; it is a genocide,' she added. 'It's unprecedented crimes.'
Zaqout said many residents of the Bureij camp had been forced to head to the Nuseirat refugee camp, further west, due to the constant, intense shelling by the Israeli military since last month.
Upon returning, they found their homes levelled to the ground and some of the dead buried under the debris. The elderly woman said she used to 'come every now and then, despite the ruthless shelling'.
'It was very dangerous, but I have to come and check on my chicken livestock. I am not afraid. If I am destined to be killed, I will die. My life is not in the hands of the Zionists.'
'I hope the ceasefire can last forever'
Another resident of the camp talked about the unimaginable destruction that awaited him upon his return.
'Honestly, I never imagined the scale of destruction; not even 1 percent of it,' the young man said.
'My home was shelled. It suffered damages and is not fit to live in any more. It must be rebuilt all over again,' he added.
When asked how he could stay there again, he said he would prefer to live in a house without walls 'than get humiliated in overcrowded UN schools'.
'We drink seawater and pretend it is freshwater. What can we do?'
Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forced to take shelter inside United Nation-run schools since the start of the war. But they have not proven safe either, and many Israeli attacks targeting them have left dozens of civilians dead.
The  , which runs until Monday, involves the release of dozens of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel in exchange for Israelis and other nationals held in Gaza.
It may be  , the United States and others have signalled, but Israel and its Western allies have not supported a ceasefire in the besieged strip.
Another Gaza resident speaking to Al Jazeera said they 'wish for eternal peace, not just four days, because people have gone through too many pains and are still suffering'.
'I hope the ceasefire can last forever. Why? Because we are tired, we are tired of a life like this."
Another displaced Palestinian, a resident of Khuza'a in southern Gaza, said the scale of destruction left them shocked after returning home to the north.
'The destruction is very large, tears come down alone. God suffices us and that's all I can say.'

South Africa joins diplomatic boycott of Israel over Gaza war

The South African government has said it will recall all diplomats from Israel to "signal" its concern over the situation in Gaza.
Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, a minister in the president's office, said on Monday that all diplomatic staff in Tel Aviv would be called to return to Pretoria for consultations, without providing further details.
"We are … extremely concerned at the continued killing of children and innocent civilians in the Palestinian territories and we believe the nature of response by Israel has become one of collective punishment," Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor told a later press conference.
"We felt it important that we do signal the concern of South Africa while continuing to call for a comprehensive cessation [of hostilities]."
Fighting has raged in the Gaza Strip for a month since Hamas fighters launched an unprecedented attack across the border into Israel on October 7.
More than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, have been killed in Israel since the attack, during which Hamas took more than 240 people hostage.
In response, Israel has relentlessly bombarded Gaza and sent in ground troops. The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory says close to 10,000 people have been killed. The casualties are mainly civilians and include several thousand children.
Pretoria has long been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, with the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party often linking it to its own earlier struggle against apartheid.
Pandor said the recall of the diplomats was "normal practice", adding the envoys would give a "full briefing" on the situation to the government, which will then decide whether it can be of assistance or if a "continued relationship is actually able to be sustained".
Several countries have recalled diplomats from Israel as global criticism of its continued bombardment of Gaza grows.

South Africa says time to stop 'crime against humanity' in Gaza

The world has seen enough of the tragedy in Gaza and it is time for countries to use their influence over Israel to put a stop to 'this real crime against humanity', South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor has said.
South Africa was one of the few countries that cut ties with Israel in response to its attack on the Gaza Strip.
Pandor told Al Jazeera on Wednesday that her government may refer Israel to the   (ICC) as it continues its assault on Gaza.
'We are appalled at how this horror and tragedy that is unfolding continues to get worse and worse. I think the world has seen enough, and it is time for the most powerful in the world to put a stop to this horror that Israel is unfolding against the people of Palestine,' she said.
'It is only countries that have influence over Israel who can stop this real crime against humanity that we are seeing right before our eyes.'
The Palestinian people experience conditions similar to those in   South Africa, she added.
South Africa has been outspoken about the plight of Palestinians and   from Israel this month, as the death toll from Israel's bombardment of Gaza continues to climb.
Palestinian authorities have said that more than 11,200 people in Gaza, more than a third of them children, have been killed since Israel began its attack on the Gaza Strip in retaliation for an attack by Hamas that Israeli authorities say killed about  , mostly civilians.
While that attack by Hamas was widely condemned, Israel's response has garnered criticism as a campaign of relentless air strikes has wiped out entire neighbourhoods and as an   chokes off access to necessities such as food, fuel and electricity for Gaza's 2.3 million residents.
The United Nations has said that about 70 percent of people in Gaza have been displaced, with few options for safe haven as   pound every corner of the Strip, including areas that Israel told Palestinians they should relocate to in order to avoid the fighting.
'We would have anticipated that the ICC would react much earlier because thousands of people have been mowed down,' Pandor said. 'And these are innocent Palestinian people who have suffered decades of harassment and occupation.'
That occupation, she said, also has 'very, very clear similarities,' to some of the practices that defined apartheid South Africa.
"We know people cannot own property, [and] that property can be seized without any compensation, which is what we experienced in our own country. People have to carry identity documents that reflect your ethnicity rather than citizenship. All of this is part of the apartheid feature,' Pandor told Al Jazeera.
'So, there can be no denial that the corollary between the conduct of the Israeli state against the people of Palestine is so closely aligned to the apartheid conduct.'

'Can't stay silent any more': Rage in Lebanon over war on Gaza

Beirut, Lebanon – Protesters, waving Palestinian and Lebanese party flags, threw rocks, water bottles and firecrackers at the security barricade, constructed on the road leading to the United States Embassy in a northern suburb of Beirut on Wednesday.
Security forces responded with tear gas that pushed the protesters back.
Overlooking the protest from the periphery, a 20-year-old Palestinian man from Nahr el-Bared, a refugee camp near the city of Tripoli in north Lebanon, rubbed his eyes. He had just come back from the front of the protest.
'I wanted to go inside and 'kharreb el-dineh',' he said, using an expression that means 'to cause havoc' but literally translates to 'destroy the world'.
'I came to protest here because America is supporting Israel,' he said.
Technically at war, Lebanon and Israel have no diplomatic relations. Instead, thousands of protesters rallied at the US embassy on Wednesday, calling for an end to hostilities as   over Gaza.
Protesters waved Palestinian and Lebanese party flags – including that of Hezbollah, who had called for 'a day of unprecedented anger' ahead of the demonstration.
The protesters travelled by bus, car and motorised scooter, and came from all over Lebanon to express their rage at what they consider Washington's unflinching backing of Israel and its 
The US sends $3.8bn in annual military   to Israel and has historically supported their ally in the Middle East, regardless of which political party is in the White House.
Indignation was palpable among the protesters on Wednesday, coming a day after an explosion at   killed an estimated 500 people.
US President Joe Biden said he thought the attack was 'done by the other team', in a face-to-face meeting with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while on a whirlwind trip to Israel.
More than 3,300, a third of them children, have died from Israeli bombing since October 7, when aHamas attack on southern Israel left around 1,400 people dead.
But many protesters said their fury was not about the al-Ahli hospital attack alone.
'We are here for yesterday ['s attack] but also for the years before,' Ahmad, 43, from the Palestinian refugee camp of Burj el-Barajneh, told Al Jazeera.
'Kill Hamas, but don't kill civilians,' Ahmad said, sitting on his Palestinian-flag-decorated motorised scooter with his two sons.
'If any foreigner hits a dog, he goes to the international court, but when [Israelis attack Palestinians], nothing happens,' he added.
'Anywhere they are protesting America, I'll be there'
The protesters' sense of indignity comes as Palestinians feel the international community has ignored their suffering and as Israeli government officials have used dehumanising language, calling Palestinian people '  ' and 'children of darkness'.
As Ahmad spoke, protesters wearing Palestinian-patterned keffiyehs, sat on top of the security-constructed barricade to keep demonstrators from nearing the US Embassy, in the northern town of Awkar.
Some threw rocks or water bottles over the fence at Lebanese security forces, who in turn responded with water cannons and waves of tear gas.
There are around 210,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, according to UNICEF. Most live between the country's handful of refugee camps because they are barred from owning property and banned from accessing formal education or holding many jobs in Lebanon.
Support for the Palestinian cause has traditionally come from the Lebanese left, who fought alongside Palestinian groups during Lebanon's civil war. Today,  , the Amal Movement, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party and the Lebanese Communist Party support the Palestinian cause in rhetoric but have done little legislatively to help refugees living in dire situations in Lebanon.
Flags from these Lebanese political parties were waved next to the Palestinian flag at the protest where some attendees were neither Palestinian nor publicly supporting a party.
'I'm a Lebanese Maronite and they bombed a Christian hospital,' a 40-year-old man who identified himself as Abou Elias el-Hajj said from the protest's periphery.
'Anywhere they are protesting America, I'll be there,' he said.
Next to him stood 35-year-old Elias Sebali.
'What happened yesterday could happen tomorrow against Christians in Lebanon,' he said.
These two men were locals from the region, but not all nearby residents were in support of the protest.
Eliane, 33, closed her minimarket just down the street from where the barricade was set up on Wednesday. As the protest was starting, she sat on the pavement in front of her store smoking a water pipe.
'If they want to fight, we are with them, but this is not the right time or place,' she said, adding that a few protesters had caused property damage and scared employees of local businesses during a protest the night before.
'They have a just cause, but it's not a clever way to act,' she added.
'Before they even lived, they died'
Protests took place in other parts of Lebanon on Wednesday, including near the German embassy and in the southern Beirut suburb of Haret Hreik. On the road leading to the German embassy in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, a few dozen people gathered at the start of the demonstration.
Unlike at the US embassy, no party flags were present. Some said they came because they did not want to attend a protest with Hezbollah and their Lebanese allies, but still wanted to voice their opposition to Israel's killing of Palestinian civilians.
'It's not about the German embassy per se,' said Mohammad, 52, from Beirut. 'It's about standing for what is right. When pregnant women and children are being killed, you can't stay silent any more.'
Other protesters said the German embassy's unflinching support for Israel drew their attention, with one protester-led chant calling it the 'Zionist embassy'.
Many in attendance called for an end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and what international rights groups such as  . The most frequent call from protesters, however, was to stop the killing in Gaza.
This call hit closer to home for some in attendance.
'My family is alive at the moment, that's all I can say,' said Zainab, 26, who is from Gaza and studying human rights and democracy at Saint Joseph's University in Beirut.
A common refrain among protesters was how helpless they felt.
As the demonstrators took out their anger on the barricade blocking the road to the US embassy, a unit of Lebanese police officers stood nearby in case they needed to intervene.
What is happening is normal, one officer told Al Jazeera, standing near where the crowd was attacking the barricade. The protesters were looking for a way to vent their helplessness and frustration.
'There's nothing I can do,' said NajIa el-Hassan, 38, adding that as a mother, seeing the death of children on television had moved her to attend the protest.
'Before they even lived, they died,' she said.

Frustration, concern rise in Arab American communities amid Gaza war

October 19th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - Civil rights advocates in the United States have   that dehumanising rhetoric about the Israel-Hamas war could translate into attacks on Palestinian, Arab and Muslim American communities at home.
Those fears appear to have materialised in the ugliest way when a six-year-old   was stabbed to death in a suspected hate crime near Chicago on Saturday.
While President Joe Biden has strongly condemned  bigotry "in all its forms" since the start of the war, Arab advocates say his administration's approach to the conflict is fuelling hatred against their communities.
Addressing the current atmosphere, Maya Berry, the executive director of the Arab American Institute think-tank, decried efforts to demonise support for Palestinian rights.
"We had a press secretary stand at the podium, behind the presidential seal at the White House, and say that advocacy for human rights — by calling for a ceasefire, by acknowledging the Palestinian victims — was 'repugnant'," Berry told Al Jazeera.
That incident occurred on October 10, when White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about statements progressive lawmakers made calling for a ceasefire. The reporter posing the question alleged that some of those lawmakers had equated Israel's actions with that of the Palestinian group Hamas.
"I've seen some of those statements this weekend, and we're going to continue to be very clear," Jean-Pierre replied . "We believe they are wrong, we believe they're repugnant, and we believe they're disgraceful."
The conflict erupted on October 7 when Hamas launched a   against Israel from the besieged Gaza Strip, killing more than 1,300 people and taking dozens captive.
Israel responded with a declaration of war and an ongoing bombing campaign that has killed at least 3,785 Palestinians, including hundreds of children in Gaza.
Vilifying rights advocates
With the war raging, activists say communities that support the Palestinian cause have been on edge as officials and media figures in the US advance a narrative that conflates advocacy for Palestinian human rights with support for Hamas's attack.
Last week, New York Governor   was asked about her message to members of the state's Palestinian community "who fear for their own civilian loved ones" in Gaza. She responded by calling for "law-abiding Palestinians to reject Hamas", without mentioning violence against Palestinians.
Meanwhile, in San Francisco, District Attorney Brooke Jenkins called a peaceful protest for Gaza on Saturday a "pro-Hamas rally" in a now-deleted social media post.
Afterwards, in a statement to Al Jazeera, Jenkins said she removed the post after listening to concerns from the Arab and Muslim community. She cited graffiti that said "death 2 Israel" that was sprayed in downtown San Francisco on the same day as the march.
"We must acknowledge that both our Arab, Muslim and Jewish communities are in pain because of the loss of innocent lives and fearful of what may come next. No form of hate will be tolerated in San Francisco," Jenkins said.
Palestinian rights supporters fear the backlash they face will be amplified by calls for unchecked violence in Gaza, particularly from the political right.
For example, Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said earlier this week, "As far as I'm concerned, Israel can bounce the rubble in Gaza." Another senator, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, described the conflict as a "religious war" — one in which he sided with Israel.
"Do whatever the hell you have to do to defend yourself," he said of Israel's attacks on Gaza. "Level the place."

- Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 11, 2023
A history of violence
For advocates, the political commentary in the US overlooks a long history of violence against the Palestinian people.
Berry highlighted the plight of Palestinians, from the mass displacement   to the occupation of their territories in 1967 to the siege on Gaza over the past 16 years.
Leading rights groups, including  , have also accused Israel of imposing apartheid on Palestinians.
"All of that gets reduced to: 'You are advocating for positions consistent with Nazis and ISIS,'" Berry said. 'With that, I worry our fellow Americans are being told to fear us or attack us. This has been a moral bankruptcy of the public discourse."
That fear crystallised when six-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian American child, was stabbed 26 times by his family's landlord on Saturday.
Local authorities said the suspect   and his mother, who was injured, "due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis".
Palestinian communities across the country were shaken in the wake of the news.
"Anytime that there is a hysteria that dehumanises any people, we shouldn't be surprised that this sort of thing happens," Palestinian American analyst Yousef Munayyer told Al Jazeera after the attack.

Biden's response
President Biden was quick to condemn the suspected hate crime. "This horrific act of hate has no place in America and stands against our fundamental values: freedom from fear for how we pray, what we believe, and who we are," he said in a statement.
"As Americans, we must come together and reject Islamophobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred."
But Berry said condemning religious bigotry is not enough. She added that the   has failed to approach the conflict with the "simple" principle that the killing of civilians must be condemned no matter who perpetrates it.
"Their inability to do that — their inability to acknowledge Palestinian suffering — has reduced those voices of ours that do to marginal people that need to be condemned or, at best, sidelined," she said.
'It is why defending religious liberty is safer for those who do not want to speak of anti-Arab bigotry and the history of exclusion my community has faced because of our support for Palestinian human rights."
For his part, Abed Ayoub, executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), said Biden's statement came too late.
"The administration was warned multiple times that there is going to be an increase of hate crimes that could lead to violent crimes against our community in the US," Ayoub said.
"And they continued with their misinformation. And they continued with their ignoring of the Palestinians in our perspective and erasing our narrative from the public discourse."
Last week, Biden   that he saw pictures proving that Hamas "decapitated children", sparking an outcry from Arab American advocates.
'Tensions are high'
Mariam Charara, the executive director of the Arab American Civil Rights League (ACRL), an advocacy group based in Dearborn, Michigan, said there is growing frustration amongst   as the conflict continues.
"The tensions are high. Emotions are high as well," Charara told Al Jazeera. "And it's unfortunate because some of them are also losing hope in how the system is run."
Dearborn, a   that is home to a large Arab community, has been the target of a flood of bigoted comments online over rallies in support of Palestinian rights.
As Mayor of the City of Dearborn, my top priority is ensuring the safety of our residents. Given recent events, I want every member of our community to know that we are taking all necessary precautions. The Dearborn Police Department is ramping up patrols, working overtime, and
- Abdullah H. Hammoud (@AHammoudMI) October 15, 2023
A man from a neighbouring city was arrested last week for making threats on social media against Palestinian Americans in the suburb.
Munayyer, the analyst, said that although Arab Americans are concerned for their safety, they "also feel that there is an urgency, particularly in the Palestinian community, to speak up for those Palestinians in Gaza — who are at the greatest risk in this very dangerous moment".
Ayoub also said that the Arab Americans are not deterred by attempts to silence them.
"We're a strong community; we're an organised community. We are a community that has resources and skills," he told Al Jazeera. "So we're going to push back. We're going to fight back. We're not going to take this lying down."

China urges Gaza ceasefire, willing to do whatever needed to end violence

China is willing to do 'whatever is conducive' to promote dialogue, secure a ceasefire and restore peace amid the deepening conflict in Gaza, China's state media has reported, citing the country's special envoy on the Middle East.
Veteran diplomat Zhai Jun is currently on a tour of the region and described the situation in Gaza as 'very serious', state-run China Central Television said on Monday. He also said a potential large-scale ground conflict and armed conflicts spreading to neighbouring countries were 'worrisome'.
China will continue close communication with all parties in the international community, said Zhai, who took part in Sunday's   where United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for swift "action to end this godawful nightmare" after two weeks of war between Israel and the armed group Hamas.
The latest conflict erupted on October 7 after Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel killing at least 1,400 people and taking  . Israel responded with force, declaring war on the besieged Gaza Strip and subjecting the territory to  . At least 4,651 Palestinians have been killed so far.
At the Cairo meeting, Zhai called for an "immediate ceasefire and an end to the fighting as quickly as possible", the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
"China believes that force is not a way to resolve the problem and that responding to violence with violence will only lead to a vicious circle of revenge," Zhai said.
Beijing has maintained good relations with Israel but has also supported the Palestinian cause for decades.
The Chinese envoy is on a diplomatic tour of the region, aimed at trying to secure an avenue for humanitarian supplies into the territory and work towards a ceasefire. He has already held phone calls with foreign ministers from countries including Palestine and Israel as well as with representatives from the UN and European Union.
China has provided and will continue to provide emergency assistance to Palestinians through the UN and via bilateral channels to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis, state media quoted Zhai as saying.
The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt was opened at the weekend to allow some aid trucks into Gaza, with a   carrying medical aid, food and water entering the territory on Sunday. Gaza is home to some 2.3 million people.

In West Bank, Israel continues to hold back Palestinian development

September 14th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Khirbet al-Ras al-Ahmar, occupied West Bank – Thaer Bsharat is one of 130 Palestinians living in this remote village in the northern Jordan Valley. They have little means, but a lot of determination.
Bsharat was born and raised in the   village, which is surrounded by two illegal Israeli settlements and two Israeli military bases. It was declared a closed military zone more than two decades ago.
The very presence of the Palestinians, let alone any structure they erect, is deemed 'illegal' under Israeli law.
Most of the residents in Khirbet al-Ras al-Ahmar cultivate land and raise livestock.
'I can preach for hours about the need to remain steadfast, but I also have nowhere else to go with my sheep,' Bsharat told Al Jazeera, explaining why he has never left the village to live somewhere else.
In April, Israeli forces raided Khirbet al-Ras al-Ahmar and confiscated several tractors, trolleys and cars. Water tanks had been confiscated a few months prior, all on the pretext that they had entered Firing Zone 901 - a designated Israeli military training area – leaving most of the locals with no access to water and no means of transportation.
The 30-year-old Bsharat had to turn to his trusted Hanan - his donkey, whose name means "compassion" - to transport milk barrels through the muddy hills outside the village so he could sell them.
'Instead of moving forward, we're being pushed back,' he said of Israeli encroachment.
Israel has long said it intends to maintain military control over the 2,400-square-kilometre (927-square-mile) Jordan Valley for security reasons, even though Palestinians seek it for the eastern perimeter of a future Palestinian state in the West Bank and blockaded Gaza Strip.
Resistance-based resilience
That state still does not exist. Instead, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has limited governance in the West Bank.
Since it was established in 1994, the PA has issued several development plans.
The government's mission is to promote resistance-based resilience and build national institutions, the PA's last plan, published in 2019, said. While such plans are meant to be roadmaps for policymakers, they are also presented to the international donor community to attract aid.
'Donors come with their own agendas and we have our own priorities. Alignment is difficult to achieve, but in recent years our priorities have become clearer,' Estephan Salameh, the Palestinian prime minister's adviser for planning and aid coordination, told Al Jazeera.
Israel, however, has different priorities and Palestinian development appears to not be one.
'Israel is determined to not allow the Palestinians to develop economically and socially because this is part of Palestinian self-determination, which Israel has consistently denied,' Tariq Dana, a professor of conflict and humanitarian studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera.
Israel has full control over more than 60 percent of the occupied West Bank – designated under the   as   – in addition to its natural resources and borders, and has the power to confiscate land, prevent industrialisation and control monetary policies.
In essence, analysts argue, Israel has been "de-developing" the occupied Palestinian territory by eradicating all conditions necessary to achieve development.
'Israel forced the Palestinians into a situation of structural dependency on its economy,' Dana said.
'Stabilising the situation'
Overall, donors have spent more than $40bn on Palestinians since the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993, rendering Palestinians one of the highest per capita recipients of nonmilitary aid in the world.
The money goes into three different baskets, Salameh explained: budget support, humanitarian aid and development.
The figures and ratios vary, but development aid never made up more than 30 percent of the incoming money, at best, he added.
According to Salameh, donations to the PA have been steadily declining since 2011, with 2021 being the worst on record in terms of budget support. PA figures from 2022 show $231m in aid going towards the budget, the second lowest since 2004. International aid initially earmarked to foster the peace process could not keep it alive. Priorities for all those involved have changed, several times, and so have the amounts granted.
In the early PA years, money was pumped in to create an atmosphere that would support the two-state solution, and then to foster institution-building and execute reforms.
In recent years, stabilisation has leaked into the international donor community vocabulary.
'They know they're only stabilising the situation until something political happens,' Salameh said.
However, the question of whether the status quo should be maintained is often answered with another: What's the alternative?
Detached from a political process, the continued provision of aid by donors is excused by citing the 'need to protect the viability of the two-state solution'.
But behind closed doors, diplomats who spoke to Al Jazeera question what they are investing in.
In public and donors' terms, aid in the current atmosphere is not a comprehensive approach that will tackle the core issues facing the Palestinians.
'We're trying to address at a micro-level things we need to address at a macro-level,' former head of the European Union mission to the PA, Sven Kuhn von Burgsdorff, told Al Jazeera. 'It might seem futile in the short term We're actually sustaining the hope of the Palestinian people.'
'Israeli colonial dynamics'
Despair and not hope, however, is the sentiment most Palestinians have, particularly in places such as the Jordan Valley.
The PA has little jurisdiction over the area that makes up roughly one-third of the occupied West Bank and is considered its breadbasket.
Palestinian officials said they opt for foreign donor support to protect the small projects they can build in the Jordan Valley, but even that does not always work.
Israel demolished more than 950 Palestinian-owned structures in the occupied West Bank last year, 177 of which were in the Jordan Valley.
Since 2016, Israel has demolished European Union-funded structures worth more than $2.3m.
While it may sound counterintuitive, Israel has previously requested that the international community provide aid to the PA.
In fact, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly asked ex-President Donald Trump in 2019 to allow American aid to be transferred to PA security forces at a time when Washington had cut all funds to the Palestinians.
'Aid to the PA is subject to the geopolitical considerations … It aims to achieve levels of stability and pacify the Palestinians while leaving Israeli colonial dynamics undeterred,' Dana said.
No official figures are available as to how much international aid goes towards security, but it is estimated that nearly one-third is allocated to the sector.
PA security expenses in 2022, according  tothe Civil Society Team for Enhancing Public Budget Transparency,are estimated at$1bn,mostgoing towards salaries.
Education and health sector expenses followed with20percent and 14 percent, respectively, of the total $4.7bn budget.
According to the 2022 PA budget, the agricultural sector's share is shy of $67m.
In Khirbet al-Ras al-Ahmar, Bsharat said local officials visited the village in solidarity and promised to help.
When he asked for a tractor a few days afterwards, he said, they suggested he borrow one from his neighbours - but theirs were confiscated as well.
Hanan the donkey was all he had until he could come up with $1,500 to get back his tractor, which is worth less than $3,000, from the Israelis.
Two months later he had paid the fine and the tractor was back, although he said some engine parts were missing.
'We're losing our health and wealth, we're losing our dignity only to stay where we are,' he said.

Biden's Israel funding request gets scrutiny, hits early hurdle

November 1st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Washington, DC - A rights group in the United States has raised alarm over President Joe Biden's request for   for Israel, noting that the push contains language that suggests efforts to remove Palestinians from Gaza.
Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN) warned on Monday that Biden's funding request could "bankroll" the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.
"These resources would support displaced and conflict-affected civilians, including Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the West Bank" and "address potential needs of Gazans fleeing to neighboring countries", a White House letter  about the funding request explains.
"This would include food and nonfood items, healthcare, emergency shelter support, water and sanitation assistance, and emergency protection. This would also include potential critical humanitarian infrastructure costs needed for the refugee population to provide access to basic, life-sustaining support."
The letter, addressed to Congress and sent on October 20, goes on to say that the Israel-Hamas war "could well result in displacement across border and higher regional humanitarian needs, and funding may be used to meet evolving programming requirements outside of Gaza".
Concerns about Palestinian displacement were amplified after +972 Magazine reported  it had received a leaked Israeli government document outlining a plan to transfer Gaza's entire population abroad. The magazine added that a source in Israel's Intelligence Ministry confirmed the document's authenticity.
"The Biden administration isn't just giving a green light for ethnic cleansing — it's bankrolling it," Sarah Leah Whitson, DAWN's executive director, said in a statement.
"Gaslighting Americans into facilitating long-held Israeli plans to depopulate Gaza under the cover of 'humanitarian aid' is a cruel and grotesque hoax."
Gaza is home to an estimated 2.3 million people, the majority of whom are refugees or descendants of people who were displaced from historic Palestine during the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.
The White House did not respond to Al Jazeera's requests for comment, but   signalled this week that it does not endorse plans to remove Palestinians from their homes.
On Sunday, Biden discussed  with his Egyptian counterpart   "the importance of protecting civilian lives, respect for international humanitarian law, and ensuring that Palestinians in Gaza are not displaced to Egypt or any other nation".
A day later, White House National Security Spokesperson John Kirby said the US is still working on "safe passage" abroad for Gaza residents seeking to escape the ongoing Israeli bombardment, but he acknowledged that not many "want to flee forever and go somewhere else in the world".
"So, at some point, you've got to start thinking through what that's going to look like," Kirby said. "And I just don't know that we've had any solid answers to that right now."
Egypt has rejected moving Gaza's population into its territory.
Domestically, Biden's funding request hit an early snag in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, despite its overwhelming support for Israel.
Republican lawmakers, under newly elected House Speaker  , introduced a bill that separates aid for Israel from assistance for Ukraine. Biden's proposal had combined the funds for a total request of $105bn.
Moreover, the Republican bill would offset the Israel aid by slashing funding from the   (IRS), the US tax agency — and a longstanding target for conservatives.
Several Democrats have voiced opposition to the Republican proposal, suggesting that the two parties would need to compromise to push forward any legislation for aid money. Democrats control the Senate and the White House, whose approval is needed to pass laws.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer rejected the Republican bill on Tuesday, accusing right-wing lawmakers of seeking to help rich people avoid paying taxes by siphoning money away from the IRS.
"It's insulting that the hard right is openly trying to exploit the crisis in Israel to try and reward the ultra-rich," Schumer, a staunch Israel supporter, said in a statement.
"The new Speaker knows perfectly well that if you want to help Israel, you can't propose legislation that is full of poison pills. And this kind of unnecessarily partisan legislation sends the wrong message to our allies and adversaries around the world."
But far-right Congresswoman   welcomed the bill.
"We can't spend unlimited money. We're $33 trillion in debt. The money has to come somewhere and it should come from the IRS which is being weaponized against the public," she wrote on the social media platform X.
"Now, Democrats can decide if they prefer helping our allies in Israel or targeting Americans with the IRS."
The Israel foreign aid bill is crafted brilliantly.
$14.3 billion paid for from IRS funds.
We can't spend unlimited money. We're $33 trillion in debt. The money has to come somewhere and it should come from the IRS which is being weaponized against the public.
Now, Democrats
- Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) October 31, 2023
Progressive lawmakers have long called for conditions to be placed on aid to Israel — to discourage abuses against Palestinians — but those voices remain a small minority in Congress.
Israel, which is accused of   on Palestinians by major rights groups like Amnesty International, receives approximately $3.8bn  in US military assistance annually.

Abdallah al-Naami cannot stop wondering what comes next as the Israel-Hamas war approaches the end of its second week.
"What kind of life will be left in Gaza after all this? It's day 13. Around half of Gaza is wiped out," the 23-year-old journalist, photographer and teacher told Al Jazeera. "Even if we survive the bombs, we survive starvation, what will be left?"
Al-Naami lives in  , a narrow band of Palestinian territory pressed against the Mediterranean Sea.
Home to 2.3 million people, Gaza has been the focal point of Israel's   ever since the country   on Hamas, the Palestinian armed group responsible for a   on October 7.
But the war has left Gaza residents like al-Naami fearful for their lives. In addition to the bombardment, Israel has announced a "  " on the territory, limiting access to food, fuel and other basic supplies.
That comes on top of   that predate the war. Since 2007, Israel has  , limiting the flow of goods and residents' ability to travel as part of its response to Hamas taking power there. Palestinians in the territory have also experienced several Israeli attacks since 2008.

People in Gaza have never had a "normal life", al-Naami explained. But the current situation? Al-Naami has "never seen anything like this".
"Every aspect of our daily lives has been targeted," he said, noting damage and impacts to "residential buildings, universities, mosques, bakeries, hospitals and schools".
With aerial attacks daily, al-Naami fears the destruction will be difficult to recover from. "We would need more than a year just to clear out the rubble from the streets."
Before October 7, al-Naami taught at the University College of Applied Sciences of Gaza, leading classes of nearly 200 students during the day and focusing on his writing and photography in the evenings. But the war upended his life "in the blink of an eye".
The university campus has been severely damaged in Israeli air raids, and some of his students have been among the more than 3,700 people killed in the bombardment.
"I know of at least one who was killed on the first day of the fighting. It was hard for me to take," al-Naami said. He described the late student as one of the "funniest" people in his classroom.
"When I try to imagine what my class would be like without him, it's unimaginable. It will be hard for me to continue to teach with the same level of excitement knowing he's gone."

'Not leaving'
Al-Naami lives in the al-Maghazi refugee camp, located south of Gaza City. He considered evacuating at the start of the war, but he and his family ultimately decided against it: No place felt safe in the Gaza Strip.
"I'd rather die in my house than on the street," he said.
Recently, an explosion at the   in Gaza City killed hundreds and drew  . But Israel's bombardment has continued unabated, according to al-Naami.
"It's not only the warplanes that are dropping bombs. They use artillery fire from the east. They use warships from the west, from the Mediterranean Sea. The sounds of these bombs come from the sky, the east, the west," he said. "It's non-stop."
Nevertheless, al-Naami said he is prepared to stay put in Gaza no matter the cost. "We are not leaving Gaza. We are not abandoning Palestine," he asserted.
He compared the situation to the   or "catastrophe": As the state of Israel took shape, military forces expelled more than 750,000 Palestinians from their homes in historic Palestine, forging an enduring legacy of trauma and displacement.
Al-Naami explained that he and other Palestinians refuse to go through a "second Nakba", similar to what their parents and grandparents endured.
"We will face all the problems Israel is creating for us and will hold our ground in Gaza as proud Palestinians," he said.

Finance minister to renew funds to Palestinians in Israel after backlash

Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said his ministry would unblock funds for Palestinian communities in Israel, after he had previously suspended the money, saying it was fuelling crime, and triggering outrage from local mayors and some lawmakers.
Smotrich, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government, said this month that some of the budget funds meant for Palestinian-majority local councils were a political payoff by the previous government that could end up in the hands of "criminals and terrorists".
Smotrich, who lives in an illegal settlement in the occupied West Bank, has made several anti-Palestinian comments in the past, including saying that the Palestinian people were  , and calling for a Palestinian town in the West Bank to be  .
Palestinian-majority councils held a strike last week in protest and community leaders demonstrated outside government offices. The National Committee of Arab Local Councils in Israel also accused Smotrich of racism.
In a statement on Monday, Smotrich appeared to reverse course and said an oversight mechanism had been created to transfer funds to the communities.
"We are stopping the criminal organisations from taking over the budgets that go to the Arab authorities," Smotrich said.
Palestinian citizens of Israel, descendants of Palestinians who remained in Israel after its formation, an event known by Palestinians as the   (catastrophe), make up about a fifth of the country's population.
While they hold citizenship and have the right to vote, they have long faced discrimination. Many Palestinian communities inside Israel are underfunded and marginalised.
Palestinian citizens of Israel say they have always been treated as inferior to Jewish citizens.
In 2018, Israel's so-called   was passed, defining it as the national homeland for the Jewish people while downgrading the status of Palestinians and their Arabic language.
Palestinians are often arrested for their participation in protests against issues including settler violence, and the Israeli forces' recurring crackdowns on the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem.
In 2021, hundreds took to the streets to protest Israel's deadly assault on the besieged Gaza Strip. More than 300 people were arrested at the time, Al Jazeera  .
Crime in the Palestinian communities is disproportionately high to their makeup of the overall demographic. Palestinians say that is a result of a lack of policing in their communities, high poverty levels, and a lack of investment from the central government.
At least 157 Palestinian citizens of Israel have been murdered since January, more than double the fatalities over the same period last year and the highest toll since 2014.

Why is Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital so important for the Israeli army?

Ever since the Israeli army's strikes on the Gaza Strip began after the October 7 Hamas attack, the al-Shifa Hospital in the northern part of the besieged enclave has been prominently featured in the news.
For the past five days, it has been at the centre of everything as Gaza's death toll has risen, with more than 11,500 Palestinians, nearly half of them children, killed by Israeli forces.
Brutal scenes are unfolding at the hospital as snipers have spent days shooting at anyone trying to move from one medical building to the other, prompting international outcries. But the Israeli army appears unfazed.
Al-Shifa's significance
The significance of al-Shifa Hospital is beyond the medical.
The storied medical complex, whose name translates into 'House of Healing', has been described as the beating heart of Gaza.
It has   over Palestine and became a hospital in 1946 after originally housing British army barracks. It has survived several wars and many years of Israeli occupation.
Since last month, it has been denied urgently needed supplies of medicine and fuel – and that was before Israeli troops broke in and blew up its dwindling stores of medicine.
Hospital staff had to bury dozens of people in a mass grave on the grounds as they were out of options. Dead bodies lie around its courtyard still.
Beyond that, al-Shifa is seen as a nerve centre for the Gaza government's administrative bodies. Health ministry officials have held press conferences amid the corpses there, and the government's media ministry has operated out of the hospital.
Al-Shifa kept its internet connectivity at times  , so it has also been a hot spot for journalists, some of whom are trapped there now. The hospital's director and its doctors and staff have been providing constant updates whenever possible, often rejecting Israeli claims - like one on Wednesday that it had allowed aid into the hospital.
For some Palestinians, the hospital has become a symbol of strength and standing up to a militarily stronger force that shows little restraint. Images of killed babies and maimed children that have been broadcast from inside the hospital to the world have inspired many millions to take to the streets in support of Palestinians.
Why is Israel doing this?
Israel has said it wants to take charge of Gaza's security in the future. It has contradicted its main ally, the United States, on that point since Washington wants the Palestinian Authority to take over.
But they seem to be on the same page on 'destroying' Hamas, so the ground operation would need to expand for that to happen. Taking over the main hospital in town would be essential in that scenario.
But just as al-Shifa has found new meaning among Palestinians and those watching from around the globe, what happens at the hospital has become paramount for Israel.
Israel wants to dismantle the hub that al-Shifa has become and take over what it has said it sees as the stronghold of Hamas's military and administrative capabilities. What happens to the hospital could also have an impact on the future of negotiations on releasing captives and   into Gaza.
A doctor at the hospital, Munir al-Bursh, told Israeli forces how their presence is creating a 'state of fear and hysteria', according to a recording obtained by Al Jazeera on Wednesday.
The Geneva-based Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has said 'the army might be creating the scene that might be released later' as it is the sole party controlling the atmosphere inside the hospital.
Israel's targeting of hospitals has been deeply controversial.
Nearly a month ago, it was accused of a  , but Israel and the West blamed it on Palestinian fighters firing a faulty rocket from within the Gaza Strip.
On Wednesday, US-based news outlet CNN, embedded with Israeli tanks and military spokesman Daniel Hagari, went inside the al-Shifa Hospital to ostensibly prove Israel's claims against Hamas. Hagari showed the outlet several rusted rifles and a chair as evidence that Hamas was operating there and holding captives.
What's the latest at al-Shifa?
The Israeli army has spent the past several days gradually tightening its noose around the hospital.
As part of its ground offensive into northern Gaza, it came in and surrounded the largest hospital in the Strip with soldiers, tanks, armoured vehicles, and attack drones supported by snipers.
The Israeli troops have now made their way into the hospital and raided several departments. They set up electronic checkpoints at multiple doors of the main buildings. Their tanks are in the courtyard.
This is while  . These include many displaced Palestinians taking shelter there, critically ill patients with nowhere to go, and exhausted medical staff and personnel.
According to first-hand accounts, Israeli troops targeted generators and communications units before storming in, and they also interrogated dozens of stripped and blindfolded people who already had their access to water and basic hygiene cut off.
(Al Jazeera)
Is Hamas under the hospital?
Israel's main supporting claim for laying siege to the most important hospital in Gaza is that Hamas has a main command centre operating from within and under the hospital.
This is a claim that has also been backed by the US, prompting   for effectively giving the green light to attack a hospital filled with civilians.
Neither Tel Aviv nor the White House have released any independently verified evidence to back this claim, which has been refuted by a number of the doctors and staff at the hospital.
And there has been no clear evidence that a number of the captives taken by Hamas during its October 7 attack are being held within the confines of the hospital.
Israel has also failed to allow any independent third parties into the area in order to verify claims by each side. Such heavily disputed claims have historically ended up unproven.

'Not in my name': The European Jews condemning Israel's war on Gaza

When Jonathan Ofir heard the West-led chorus of vehement condemnations of the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, coupled with a flood of statements supporting the country's  , he feared he knew what that meant.
'That is, a green light for Israel to carry out a much larger massacre than the one they were revenging,' said the Jewish musician, conductor and writer.
More than 1,400 people were killed in Israel in the Hamas attack, prompting the country's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare war on the armed Palestinian group. An incessant and brutal bombing campaign by Israel has since killed   in the Gaza Strip, with large parts of the territory reduced to rubble in just over a fortnight. A Palestinian NGO reported that the Israeli bombing of Gaza had tragically claimed the lives of one Palestinian child every 15 minutes since the start of the conflict.
Ofir, a pro-Palestinian campaigner who was born in Israel but lives in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, is among many Europe-based Jews who are critical of Israel's policies and have joined protests that have exploded across the continent against the ongoing attacks on Gaza.
From Glasgow to London, Paris to Barcelona, many have joined pro-Palestinian rallies to express solidarity with the people of the blockaded enclave. They represent a vocal minority of Jews that continue to make the case for the rights of a people who have lived under Israeli occupation for generations - the Palestinians - just as they have for decades.
'Israel claims Jews as its national asset, and it weaponises us, as Jews - both as bodies in the demographic battle vis-a-vis non-Jews and particularly Palestinians, and ideologically as born representatives of the Jewish state - [and] seeks to do that to Jews worldwide,' Ofir told Al Jazeera. 'That claim, in turn, makes [us] the human shields of the state, as it assaults Palestinians under its settler-colonialist agenda, be it through ongoing ethnic cleansing, through siege or through seasonal massacres.'
Naama Farjoun largely grew up in Jerusalem, but has long described herself as an anti-Zionist Jew. In January 2001, she left Israel, just months after the outbreak of the second Intifada. Today, the 54-year-old lives on the outskirts of Valencia, Spain.
'I left [Israel] because I could not bear the burden of being a privileged [Israeli] citizen in a racist state,' said the mother of two, who said that she was daily angered by the 'Israeli occupation and discrimination of my Palestinian co-citizens'.
Farjoun told Al Jazeera that the Hamas attack on Israel brought her 'great sorrow causing suffering no one should endure'. But she added: 'I believe the current tragic events are a direct result of years of abuse, repression, violence and deprivation implemented by the State of Israel.'
Jews — including Israeli Jews — voicing their condemnation of Israel's conduct against the Palestinians is not a new phenomenon. So-called Israeli refuseniks - citizens of Israel who have snubbed its compulsory military service laws in protest of the country's treatment of the Palestinians - have often served jail time for their principles.
Joseph Abileah, an Austrian-born musician, is widely considered to be the first individual in Israel to stand trial for refusing to serve in the Israeli military, doing so just months after the Jewish state was established in 1948. The violinist managed to escape a prison sentence, and his stance paved the way for generations of Israeli conscientious objectors.
Yet just as Israel's refuseniks often face backlash for their convictions, so too do pro-Palestinian Jews elsewhere.
It is, said one European resident, rarely easy to publicly support Palestine and condemn Israel as a self-declared Jew.
'When I first started identifying myself as Jewish and supporting Palestinian rights on X [formerly Twitter], the issue in the UK was closely bound up with Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party,' said British citizen Tom London, referring to the strident pro-Palestinian convictions of former United Kingdom opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn.
He added to Al Jazeera: 'I got plenty of abuse then on X, including describing me as an anti-Semite and saying I was lying about being Jewish. Someone once went through every tweet I had ever sent - but found nothing to help their vile and ridiculous claim that I was an anti-Semite.'
At the time of this writing, a Jewish Voice for Peace petition , calling for an immediate end to the Israeli attack on Gaza, has gathered more than 1,300 signatures from Israeli citizens living in Israel, Palestine and abroad. 'As a Jew, and particularly as an Israeli Jew, I feel it is incumbent upon me to say that this is not in my name, and I will fight it as such,' asserted Ofir. 'Because freedom, justice and equality for Palestinians is a necessity, and if that necessity doesn't get sufficed, it is not only harming them, it will come to haunt Jews."
"We need to work towards a shared future where we do not harm each other - we need to create a culture of peace. Jewish supremacy will not achieve that.'

November 15th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Kozhikode, India – Thousands of kilometres away from the Gaza Strip, which is undergoing what many observers call a "genocide", people in southern India's Kerala state are flocking to public spaces to join protests and candlelight vigils in solidarity with the Palestinians.
More than 11,300 Palestinians – half of them children – have been killed in Israeli air strikes and ground attacks on Gaza since October 7 when Hamas, in an unprecedented move, entered Israel and killed 1,200 people, according to official figures.
Israel's unrelenting and disproportionate killing of civilians and siege on hospitals providing critical care has outraged people across the world, with dozens of   held for more than a month now.
In Kerala as well, political parties, rights activists, cultural groups and Muslim organisations have held rallies and events, calling for an immediate ceasefire in the besieged enclave and censoring Israel for its alleged war crimes.

Last week, Kerala's Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated one such rally organised by his Communist Party of India (Marxist) and attended by more than 50,000 people cutting across political affiliations in Kozhikode.
The November 11 rally marked the 19th death anniversary of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader,  , an icon of resistance against the decades-old Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.
In his speech, Vijayan unleashed a scathing attack on Israel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's support of the country's far-right Zionist regime.
"India is the biggest consumer of weapons manufactured in Israel. Indian taxpayers' money should not be given to kill innocent Palestinian children. So India should scrap all military deals with Israel and sever diplomatic ties with it," he said.
"Israel is one of the biggest terrorist countries. The Indian government's decision to abstain from a UN voting that called for a ceasefire in Gaza was shameful. The 'Zionist' bias of the current rulers of India was not a surprise at all," he added.
In response, K Surendran, the Kerala state president of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),   to condemn Hamas.
'Only bearded moulavis [Muslim preachers] were present on the dais at the [Communist Party of India (Marxist)] rally. This has raised doubts among people that the left-wing party has changed its name to the Communist Party of Moulavis,' he told reporters.
On October 26, Kozhikode also saw the biggest-ever Palestine solidarity march in India, as more than 200,000 people rallied after the regional party, the Indian Union Muslim League, asked them to hit the streets to oppose the war on Gaza.
The Indian National Congress, the main opposition party in the southern Indian state, has also announced a solidarity rally on November 23.
'Informed society's solidarity'
So what makes Kerala so sensitive to the Palestinian cause?
'The Palestine issue garners widespread support in Kerala because of the historical connections between the region and West Asia, particularly the Arab world,' KM Seethi, former professor of international relations at Mahatma Gandhi University in Kerala's Kottayam town, told Al Jazeera.
Seethi said the migration from Kerala to the Gulf beginning in the early 1980s exposed them to the struggles of the Palestinian people, leading to a "natural sympathy" for their cause. Nearly 3.5 million people from the state work in the Middle East, forming a majority of the Indian expats in the region.
But there is more.
In India, which finds itself at the bottom of many human development indices such as education and health, Kerala is an outlier. Its Human Development Index at 0.792 is the highest in India. According to the 2011 census, Kerala's literacy rate stood at 93.91 percent, as opposed to the national rate of 74 percent.
Long before the Gulf migration began, public intellectuals in Kerala had been following the sociopolitical developments in the tumultuous Arab world.
One such intellectual was Vakkom Mohammed Abdul Khader Moulavi, founder of Swadeshabhimani (The Patriot) newspaper way back in 1905. An expert in West Asian politics, he used his newspaper to educate people about issues concerning Palestine and other parts of the Middle East.
'Such efforts apparently resulted in the publication of the first Malayalam book on Palestine in 1930. Written by journalist and sociopolitical observer Muhammed Kannu, the book, titled Palestine Prashnam (The Palestine Problem), was published 18 years before the formation of Israel and 49 years before Edward Said wrote The Palestine Question in 1979,' M V Bijulal, chairperson of the Centre for West Asian Studies at Mahatma Gandhi University, told Al Jazeera.
Palestine Prashnam, using historical documents, reveals how Britain used Palestine, a former colony, for political gains. The author Kannu was also a member of the editorial board of another newspaper, Al Ameen, founded by Congress leader Mohammed Abdur Rahiman.
'Kerala provides an ideal platform for international political discourses. What we are witnessing in Kerala now is an informed society's solidarity with the Palestinian cause,' said Bijulal.
In addition, journals published by ideologically opposed Muslim groups in the state also educated the community about Palestine. These organisations, belonging to the Sunni, Salafi and Jamaat-e-Islami persuasions, set aside their theological differences to publish articles condemning the Israeli occupation and its daily attacks, dehumanisation and humiliation of the Palestinian people.
'This helped their followers understand the gravity of the issue,' author and political observer Mujeeb Rahman Kinalur told Al Jazeera.
Not a Muslim issue
But that didn't mean Palestine was a Muslim issue in Kerala, where 27 percent of its 35 million people are Muslim – nearly twice the national average at around 15 percent, according to the last census conducted in 2011. Christians constitute 18 percent while Hindus form the majority at around 55 percent.
Palestine, however, remains a non-divisive issue in the state, mainly due to an unambiguous stand on it by its prominent political parties – the Indian National Congress, its closest ally the Indian Union Muslim League, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist).
All these parties have criticised the federal Hindu nationalist government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for supporting Israel and abstaining from a recent United Nations vote calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. In his social media posts and speeches, Modi has repeatedly called Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu a "close friend" while his government has built close business and strategic India-Israel ties.
MA Baby, a senior Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader, said iconic Indian freedom fighter Mahatma Gandhi and the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru believed that Palestinians were waging an independence movement, much like what the Indians did against the colonial British.
"By supporting Palestine, [the] people of Kerala are taking a leaf out of India's freedom struggle. Modi might have conveniently forgotten the sacrifices of our tallest leaders, but we would continue to emulate them,' he told Al Jazeera.
'The issue here is the liberation of Palestine. It is not a Muslim issue at all.'
The Indian Union Muslim League's Panakkad Sayyid Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal said only "the wicked minds" would see the Palestinian struggle as a Muslim issue. 'People from different faiths live in Palestine and they are engaged in a fight for their land. We stand by them. Religion is not an issue here.'
Congress leader VT Balram told Al Jazeera his party has historically denounced Israel's occupation of Palestine. 'It is the stated policy of Congress since the Nehru era. Hence we vehemently oppose Narendra Modi government's decision to support Israel in the ongoing war,' he said.
In the past decades, the people of Kerala had come out in support of Nelson Mandela in his fight against South Africa's apartheid regime or the people of Vietnam in their war against the United States and France. The state sent millions of tonnes of food and medicine to Cuba when it was put under sanctions by the US in the early 1990s. During the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, the state witnessed several anti-war rallies.
In fact, Arafat remains one of the most revered personalities in Kerala.
'In the 1950s and 1960s, photos of Yasser Arafat adorned the walls of many Communist party offices in Kerala, along with [Karl] Marx and [Frederick] Engels. It showed the [people of Kerala's] strong anti-imperialist stand,' Bijulal told Al Jazeera.

Palestinian health authorities have said that the only hospital offering cancer treatment in the Gaza Strip has gone out of service after it ran out of fuel amid Israel's continuing blockade of the territory.
The   on Gaza has cut off supplies of fuel and heavily restricted access to food, water and electricity, while the Israeli military continues to bombard the Strip,   are filled with the dying and wounded and shortages have put huge  .
In a press conference on Wednesday, Turkish-Palestinian Friendship   director Subhi Sukeyk said that the facility was no longer functioning.
"We tell the world, 'Don't leave cancer patients to a certain death due to the hospital being out of service'," Sukeyk said.
Palestinian authorities say that 8,796 people have been killed by   – more than a third of them children – since October 7, when the Palestinian armed group Hamas carried out an attack on southern Israel, which Israeli authorities say killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians.
The suspension of operations at the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital means that 16 of the Gaza Strip's 35 hospitals are now out of service, as are more than 50 of Gaza's 72 primary healthcare clinics.
"The lives of 70 cancer patients inside the hospital are seriously threatened," Palestinian Health Minister Mai al-Kaila said in a statement.
"This is a moment of life and death for thousands of patients in Gaza unless hospitals continue working," World Health Organization spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told Al Jazeera. "The case of cancer patients is already fragile. If they don't get the treatment they need, it is really a death sentence for them."
Sukeyk had   Al Jazeera that the hospital was running low on fuel, and that ceasing operations would have a devastating impact on patients.
In a social media post on Wednesday, the medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, said that the hospital had been damaged by a projectile on Monday.
"Israeli authorities continue to prevent the entry of fuel into Gaza, which is essential for powering hospitals," the group said. "In addition, hospitals and healthcare facilities are being attacked during this horrific onslaught."
Cancer patients are not the only people experiencing medical vulnerability amid heavy bombing:   also face the prospect of giving birth without medical support.
'The estimated 50,000 pregnant women and girls in Gaza risk missing ante-natal care and giving birth without electricity or medical supplies,' the group Human Rights Watch said in a previous statement.
Fuel shortages have also pushed   in Gaza to their breaking point.
'UNRWA desperately needs fuel. No fuel has come into the Gaza Strip for three and a half weeks now,' Juliette Touma, spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (  ), told Al Jazeera.
'We are completely overwhelmed. We have 670,000 people in our shelters, this is four times more than what we had planned for,' she said. 'Fuel is absolutely lifesaving.'

The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon has said that Israeli fire hit one of its patrols in the country's south, despite a  largely quietening the Lebanon-Israel frontier.
"At around 12:00 pm, a UNIFIL patrol was hit by [Israeli army] gunfire" in the vicinity of Aitarun, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon said in a statement on Saturday.
"No peacekeepers were injured, but the vehicle was damaged," it said, adding that "this incident occurred during a period of relative calm" along the border between Israel and Lebanon.
Since the  , the   has seen intensifying exchanges of fire, mainly between Israel and Shia movement Hezbollah, but also Palestinian groups, raising fears of a broader conflagration.
The scope of the border fighting has gradually increased over the weeks, but it has not turned into an all-out war yet. At first, the two sides started hitting each other with artillery attacks, and Israel also brought in its drones.
A   between Israel and Hamas began on Friday, and a source close to Hezbollah told the AFP news agency that the Iran-backed group would also adhere to the truce if Israel did.
UNIFIL said "this attack on peacekeepers, dedicated to reducing tensions and restoring stability in south Lebanon, is deeply troubling," adding, "we condemn this act."
Today at around 12 pm, a UNIFIL patrol was hit by IDF gunfire in the vicinity of Aytaroun, in southern Lebanon.
No peacekeepers were injured, but the vehicle was damaged. This incident occurred during a period of relative calm along the Blue Line.

Last month, shelling lightly   near the border village of Hula, just hours after UNIFIL said a shell hit its headquarters in Naqura near the Israel-Lebanon border.
The force said it was investigating those incidents.
"We strongly remind the parties of their obligations to protect peacekeepers and avoid putting the men and women who are working to restore stability at risk," Saturday's UNIFIL statement said.
Cross-border fire has killed 109 people in Lebanon, including 77 Hezbollah fighters and 14 civilians, three of them journalists, according to an AFP count.
Six Israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed on the Israeli side, according to the authorities.
Even as many Lebanese may feel for the plight of Palestinians, they also  , many having already experienced the 2006 war in which more than 1,200 people were killed in Lebanon, many of them civilians. At least 165 Israelis were also killed.
Since the pause went into effect on Friday, calm has largely returned to Lebanon's southern border.
UNIFIL was set up in 1978 to monitor the withdrawal of Israeli forces after they invaded Lebanon in reprisal for a Palestinian attack.
It was bolstered after the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, and its roughly 10,000 peacekeepers are tasked with monitoring the ceasefire between the two sides.

Does Israel have the right to self-defence in Gaza?

Israel has   Gaza's largest hospital and   residential areas and refugee camps in attacks the United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk says have unleashed a 'nightmarish' situation in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
There are growing calls for a ceasefire as the humanitarian situation worsens with risks of starvation facing thousands due to the Israeli blockade of the territory - home to 2.3 million people.
Israel and its allies, meanwhile, have insisted the bombings are justified because it has the   in response to the October 7 Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 people and injured more than 5,600 in southern Israel.

But what is this right to self-defence, and does it justify Israel's killing of more than 11,500 Palestinians and wounding of 29,800 since then?
What is the right to self-defence?
According to Article 51 of the UN Charter, until the UN Security Council takes measures to maintain international peace and security, 'nothing in the charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations.'
Ever since Israel embarked on the bombardment of the Gaza Strip, its officials and its Western allies – from the United States  and United Kingdom  to the European Union  – have defended Israeli actions by pointing to Article 51.
Does it apply to Israel against Gaza?
Many experts aren't convinced that it does apply.
'The right to self-defence can be invoked when the state is threatened by another state, which is not the case,'  , UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, said in an address to the Australian Press Club on Tuesday.
The attack Israel faced on October 7 came from an armed group in a territory, Gaza, that Israel has effectively controlled.
Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza in 2005, but it has imposed a land, sea and air blockade on the enclave since Hamas came to power in 2007.
That, according to Albanese, amounts to occupation – although Israel and its allies disagree with that assessment.
'Israel does not claim it has been threatened by another state. It has been threatened by an armed group within an occupied territory. It cannot claim the right of self-defence against a threat that emanates from a territory it occupies, from a territory kept under belligerent occupation,' Albanese said.
Albanese was referring to a 2004  advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which said the construction of Israel's separation wall in the occupied West Bank was illegal. The ICJ rejected the Israeli argument to build the wall, saying it could not invoke the right to self-defence in an occupied territory.
Are there other challenges to Israel's argument?
Other experts point to the devastating scale of Israeli attacks on Gaza.
'The death of a reported  , attacks on healthcare, the withholding of water and electricity – these cannot be merely justified as a 'right to self-defence',' said Iain Overton, executive director of the London-based Action on Armed Violence, which conducts research and advocacy on armed violence against civilians.
He added that for Israel to claim this right without being challenged 'would be a mockery of the international humanitarian law'.

What rules govern Israel's war on the Gaza Strip?
Armed conflicts are governed by international humanitarian law (IHL), a set of rules contained in international agreements like the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 as well as other agreements and conventions meant to ensure that all member nations subscribe to a list of fundamental rules during conflicts.
But member states do not always act by the rules, most recently during the Ukraine-Russia war. Israel has been accused of war crimes in its previous military assaults on Gaza, but it has not been held accountable.
In the current conflict, though, experts said Israel's actions seem to violate all of the four main principles of IHL: distinction between civilians and combatants, proportionality between anticipated loss of civilian life and damage and the strategic military advantage of an attack, legitimate military purposes and the humane treatment of all individuals from civilians to detainees and hostages.
Among the dead Palestinians in the current conflict as of Thursday are 4,710 children and 3,160 women.
'The scale of the bombardment and its impact on civilians raises questions about Israel's adherence to proportionality,' Overton told Al Jazeera.
Israel's bombing of Gaza has also killed 102 aid workers with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), making this the deadliest conflict ever for UN staff in the organisation's history.
Is it justifiable to attack civilians during a conflict?
IHL underlines  the fundamental rule of all wars – that parties in a conflict must always make a distinction between civilians and combatants and that civilians and civilian objects must never be attacked.
Hence, there is no justification for civilians being attacked by either side in the current conflict, and it is unlawful.
Neve Gordon, a professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London, said both Hamas's and Israel's actions were 'clearly war crimes', adding that it was 'obvious to anyone' that Hamas's actions on October 7 violated IHL.
'It is also obvious that Israel has committed war crimes in Gaza since October 7,' he said.
"There is the collective punishment through the stopping of water and electricity, the compelled movement of populations and then the unleashing of eruptive violence that is killing thousands of civilians while destroying the very infrastructure of existence in the Gaza Strip,' Gordon added.
Israel controls what goes in and out of Gaza. Even the fuel for its sole power plant, which has since shut down, has been supplied with Israel's permission.
Israel's claims that Hamas is operating out of civilian facilities, however, are aimed at justifying civilian casualties, Gordon said.
'When Israel claims Hamas targets in refugee camps and hospitals, the idea in both cases is to underscore that the value of the target is extremely high and, therefore, that Israel is abiding by the principle of proportionality even if many civilians die,' Gordon said.
What about Israeli attacks on hospitals, schools and refugee camps? Are such tactics lawful?
International humanitarian law insists that  . Similarly, international law also disallows attacks against places that are indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as drinking water installations and farmland.
Attacking schools and hospitals during the conflict, as Israel has done, is 'one of the six grave violations' , according to the UN Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict.
Yet Israel has been unrelenting in these attacks despite facing heavy criticism. Experts have pointed to how it has relied on the claim, backed by the US and EU, that Hamas is using civilians in these places as 'human shields'.
US President Joe Biden on Wednesday reiterated the Israeli claim of a Hamas base at al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest medical facility. He offered no proof, and Israel has so far not shown any evidence for that claim either.
But what if Hamas is using civilians as 'human shields'?
One way Hamas uses civilians as  , Israel insists, is by allegedly operating out of schools, hospitals, refugee camps and shelters.
But many experts believe that painting civilians as human shields is a convenient argument that Israel has used to create legitimacy for its attacks.
'When a person in a battlefield is defined as a human shield, he or she loses some of the protections assigned to civilians by the laws of war,' Gordon said.
'What many legal commentators say is that once a warring party uses human shields, lethal forms of violence that might otherwise be prohibited in a civilian setting can be used,' he added.
Others, like Overton, said that even if Israel's claims about Palestinian civilians being used as human shields are accurate, Israeli actions are still not justified.
'The claim that civilians are being used as human shields does not absolve a party from its obligations under IHL. Even if combatants are present, attacks must still adhere to the principles of distinction and proportionality,' Overton said, pointing to how UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called  Gaza a 'graveyard for children' on November 7.
'This underscores the severe impact on civilians, suggesting that the claim of human shields may not justify the scale and nature of the attacks on civilian areas,' he added.

What are some other laws that Israel has potentially violated?
Israel has also been accused of using  , which could trigger  fires as well as lead to severe, potentially fatal burns. Firing white phosphorus is akin to an indiscriminate attack, according to Amnesty International, which affects civilians and military targets alike and hence is prohibited under international law.
IHL makes it clear that parties to a conflict 'may not order the displacement of the civilian population, in whole or part' except if military reasons demand or if their security is involved.
On October 13, Israel ordered  more than 1 million Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate and move to the besieged enclave's south despite the UN warning that Gaza faced a 'real catastrophe' due to such an order. Israel has justified this order by saying it was aimed at limiting civilian casualties during its military operation in northern Gaza.
IHL also lays out that all parties in a conflict must ensure that humanitarian relief operations are allowed and facilitated 'unimpeded'. However, Israel had refused to allow essential aid into Gaza despite widespread warnings of a humanitarian crisis.
Israel's decision to impose a '  ' of Gaza's power, food and water supplies has also been widely criticised for triggering a humanitarian crisis as thousands of Palestinians face 'death by starvation', according to  the ActionAid charity. Humanitarian law prohibits the use of starvation of the civilian population 'as a method of warfare'.
'The complete siege now lasting over one month has made it an agony for residents in Gaza to find basic necessities and frankly to survive,' Turk said last week, adding that 'all forms of collective punishment must come to an end'.
Are Israel and Hamas likely to be held to account for any legal violations?
While lawyers and experts have pointed to likely violations by Israel and Hamas of international law and international humanitarian law in particular, that might not ensure legal action against them.
Experts point to the lack of action against Israel for its 2008 assault on Gaza, named Operation Cast Lead, during which Israel was accused of war crimes. The 22-day Israeli offensive killed 1,400 Palestinians. At least 13 Israelis were killed in retaliatory rocket attacks by Palestinian armed groups.
'Historical precedents, such as the inquiries following Operation Cast Lead and others, show that while investigations into Israeli actions in Gaza have occurred, they often have not led to significant preventative measures or accountability,' Overton said.
In the current conflict, the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory had announced on October 10 that there was 'clear evidence of war crimes' from both sides and added that it had been 'collecting and preserving evidence of war crimes' because it is 'intent on ensuring legal accountability, including individual criminal and command responsibility'.
"The killing of so many civilians cannot be dismissed as collateral damage. Not in a kibbutz. Not in a refugee camp. And not in a hospital," the UN human rights chief said.
At least three Palestinian rights groups have filed a   against Israel during the ongoing war. And this week,   submitted a complaint to the prosecutor at the ICC on behalf of Gaza victims.
A US-based civil rights group, the Center for Constitutional Rights, has also   and senior members of his cabinet for "complicity" in the "unfolding genocide".

Saudi Arabia to host Arab-Islamic summit to 'unify efforts' on Gaza

November 11th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Saudi Arabia is hosting an extraordinary summit on Saturday, bringing together countries from the Islamic and Arab worlds to discuss the worsening situation in Gaza.
The kingdom's foreign ministry announced the news late on Friday, saying Saudi Arabia was initially scheduled to host two summits, one of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and one of the Arab League, on Saturday. The joint summit emerged as a replacement after Saudi consulted with members of both large organisations.
According to the ministry, the joint meeting "will be held in response to the exceptional circumstances taking place in the Palestinian Gaza Strip as countries feel the need to unify efforts and come out with a unified collective position'.
The OIC includes member states from across the Islamic world, including the Palestinian territories' neighbours Egypt and Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq.
With Iran repeatedly   if Israel does not stop its attacks, President Ebrahim Raisi is also expected to attend the meeting in Riyadh, marking a first visit by an Iranian president in 11 years.
"Gaza is not an arena for words. It should be for action," Raisi said before departing for Riyadh on Saturday, adding that the Palestinian issue has become the main issue not only for the Muslim world but the whole world.
"The atrocities that are now being committed by the Zionist regime in Gaza are clear examples of war crimes and crimes against humanity," he said.
"The Americans say in their remarks and messages that they do not want the scope of the war to expand, but this claim in no way corresponds to their actions as the fuel for the Israeli war machine is provided by the Americans."
Hold Israel 'accountable'
Israel has not relented in its attacks on the Gaza Strip despite increasing calls for an immediate ceasefire, especially from the Arab and Islamic worlds.
The non-stop air strikes and ground assaults – which came in response to the October 7 attack by Hamas which killed 1,200 Israelis – have killed at least 11,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians.
Israel has significantly ramped up its attacks on   in recent days, and the United Nations has said the lives of one million children in Gaza are 'hanging on by a thread'.
The Arab League consists of 22 countries, including Syria, which was earlier this year accepted back after Arab leaders restarted talks with President Bashar al-Assad following a decade of civil war in the country.
The bloc's assistant secretary-general, Hossam Zaki, said this week the organisation aims to demonstrate 'how the Arabs will move on the international scene to stop the aggression, support Palestine and its people, condemn the Israeli occupation, and hold it accountable for its crimes'.
The extraordinary joint summit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity across the region and beyond. Saudi Arabia had hosted an African-Saudi summit in Riyadh on Friday, where Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman called for an end to the war.
Leaders of Russia, Iran, Turkey and Pakistan   on Thursday for talks that included the situation in Gaza.

Some 500 people have been arrested during a sit-in at the United States Congress in Washington, DC, where they protested against 'Israel's ongoing oppression of Palestinians', according to Jewish Voice for Peace, the group that organised the demonstration.
The protesters, many wearing shirts emblazoned with the words 'Not in our name', were surrounded by police on Wednesday as they sat on the floor of the lobby of the congressional building, unfurling a large banner that said 'ceasefire' as the   from Israel's bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip rises.
About 10,000 people also marched for the cause in the streets of the US capital, said Jewish Voice for Peace.
'We shut down Congress to draw mass attention to the US complicity in Israel's ongoing oppression of Palestinians,' the progressive Jewish organisation wrote on X.
US police said they had cleared the building of protesters by Wednesday evening and were processing arrests.
Today, 500 Jews were arrested and 10k took to the streets to support and to demand a ceasefire and an end to Palestinian genocide.

Israel has imposed a   on the Gaza Strip, blocking access to food, water, electricity and medical supplies for its 2.3 million residents after Hamas, the group running the enclave, launched an attack into southern Israel on October 7. Israeli authorities say at least 1,400 people, most of them civilians, have been killed in the attack and   were taken captive.
Since the attack, Israel has   Gaza from the air in a devastating campaign that has reduced neighbourhood after neighbourhood to rubble. Palestinian authorities say more than 3,400 people have been killed in the bombardment, a third of them children.
The Israeli attacks and siege on Gaza have been criticised as a form of   and triggered widespread anger across the Middle East and beyond.
'It has never been more important for Jews and all people in the US to rise up with literally everything we have,' said Jay Saper of Jewish Voice for Peace. 'The way that we would have wanted others to rise up for our ancestors.'
At the rally, a Jewish protester who said his grandparents had survived the Holocaust told Al Jazeera that he was honouring his family's history by taking to the streets.
'I see my job as carrying on their legacy as Jews who see their role as standing up for stateless and oppressed people all throughout the world,' Sam Thorpe said. 'I see no better way to do that than fighting for a ceasefire and peace in Gaza today.'

The US is Israel's staunchest global ally,   of military aid per year and strong diplomatic support.
On Wednesday, President Joe Biden met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  , pledging that the US 'has Israel's back' in its war against Hamas.
On the same day, the US was the   to vote against and veto a resolution at the 15-member United Nations Security Council that called for a humanitarian pause to allow   to enter Gaza.
'What we know from past Israeli state atrocities against Palestinians is that the bombs only stop once there is a sufficient mass outcry from the international community,' said Eliza Klein of Jewish Voice for Peace. 'It's on us to build that outcry — as fast as we possibly can.'

'This is Nasrallah's moment': Will Hezbollah's chief declare war on Israel?

November 2nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Lebanon is on edge in advance of Hezbollah leader Syed Hassan Nasrallah's anticipated Friday speech on Israel's war on Gaza, which residents and experts fear could inflame regional tensions if he pledges to escalate attacks against Israel.
  has escalated along their fraught border in recent weeks. The Lebanese armed group claims to have lost 47 fighters while Israel says that six of its soldiers have been killed. At least six civilians have also been killed.
Yet, some believe that Nasrallah could be preparing his constituents in southern Lebanon for an intensified conflict, even though many worry that a war could upend their lives as it did in the past.
South Lebanon has historically suffered significantly more from Israeli aggression than any other region in the country —including a 15-year-long occupation by Israel between 1985 and 2000.
'Even among [Nasrallah's] supporters, there are people who feel that [the south] always fought Israel [in the past] and that right now … we're  ,' said Mohamad, a resident from South Lebanon who did not disclose his last name for fear that speaking frankly about Hezbollah could hurt his livelihood.
Violence between Israel and Hezbollah erupted shortly after Hamas launched a surprise attack against Israeli military outposts and civilians on October 7. About 1,400 people were killed, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has retaliated by bombing Gaza relentlessly and conducting ground invasions. Gaza's health ministry says that more than 8,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 3,000 children. Many others are dying from Israel's suffocating siege, which several legal experts have said is a war crime under international law. After October 7, Israel completely blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicines and other essential supplies into Gaza. While some aid trucks carrying food and medicines have been allowed in through the Rafah crossing with Egypt in recent days, Israel still isn't allowing fuel into the enclave, crippling hospitals that need electricity to operate life-saving machines.
Despite growing calls for a ceasefire, Israel has said it will not stop attacking Gaza until it eradicates Hamas, which forms a so-called 'axis of resistance' with Hezbollah, other Shia armed groups in the region and their sponsor Iran.
But Nasrallah could warn Israel to reconsider its objective, analysts have said.
'I believe Hezbollah … views this conflict as an existential one,' said Mohannad Hage Ali, an expert on Lebanon with the Carnegie Middle East Center. 'They think that if Israel manages to meet its objectives in eradicating Hamas in the Gaza Strip, then they will turn around and deal with what they see as the Hezbollah threat.'
Hearts and minds
Hezbollah has struggled to win back support from the wider Sunni Arab world after intervening in Syria to rescue President Bashar al-Assad, an ally who belongs to an offshoot of Shia Islam.
Al-Assad allowed Iranian weapons and goods to pass through his territory to reach Hezbollah in Lebanon. And during the height of the war, Hezbollah besieged and starved civilians who opposed the Syrian regime.
Hezbollah's involvement dispelled its claim that its weapons were exclusively used to defend against Israeli aggression. But Nasrallah may now see the crisis in Gaza as an opportunity to repair his image.
'This is Nasrallah's moment,' Hage Ali told Al Jazeera.
'   will be watching his speech across the world. They will listen to the only leader in the region that is capable of speaking to their anger and despair by telling them that he will act and support Palestinians in Gaza, who face an existential threat of expulsion.'
Other Lebanese Sunni fighters are already cooperating with Hezbollah to target Israel.
Mohamad, the resident of southern Lebanon, believed that many more Sunni Muslims would support Hezbollah if its battle with Israel intensified.
'Everything that happened in Syria was forgotten in just a few days [after the war in Gaza started],' he told Al Jazeera.
Much anticipation
Despite the anxiety of Lebanese residents, Palestinian refugees in the country said that they would like Hezbollah to intensify attacks against Israel, which Nasrallah could authorise during his speech.
Ahed Bahr, a member of a Palestinian political party in Lebanon, told Al Jazeera he hoped that images of dead children from Gaza would compel the 'axis of resistance' to escalate against Israel from multiple fronts, including Lebanon.
'This is the opportunity to finally free Palestine,' he said from Sabra and Shatila, two neighbourhoods that are home to a refugee camp in Lebanon's capital Beirut. 'Arab nations can finally help Palestine, but most are doing nothing.'
So will Hezbollah and its allies step up attacks on Israel?
Iranian-backed fighters in Syria and Iraq are believed to be responsible for launching several rockets and drones at US assets and personnel in the region. The attacks appear to be in retaliation for American support for Israel's attacks on Gaza.
While no US service personnel have been killed, Washington has responded with air raids targeting fighters near the Syria-Iraq border. The US had also warned Hezbollah against escalating attacks against Israel.
Rather than respond, Nasrallah has kept mum for three weeks. Until now.
'It just feels like there is a major decision from the 'resistance axis' coming,' said Mohamad. 'That decision could come on Friday.'

Palestinian Authority cracks down on protests over Israel Gaza attacks

Ramallah, occupied West Bank – A young Palestinian girl was shot and killed by Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces on Tuesday during protests in the northern West Bank city of Jenin in response to the deadly explosion at a hospital in the besieged Gaza Strip.
The family of 12-year-old Razan Nasrallah confirmed to Al Jazeera that she was killed at about 10pm on Tuesday night.
"A bullet entered the right side of her chest. It pierced her lungs and hit her heart," her uncle, 64-year-old Ziad Nasrallah told Al Jazeera.
"We consider her a martyr who was killed defending Gaza. We mourn her with pride," he continued.
A funeral procession was held for her on Wednesday morning in Jenin.
 
[Translation: "It is with great pride that we mourn our daughter the martyr and child, Razan Attaba Hamidi Nasrallah, who was martyred in defence of religion and in support of our people in Gaza."]
Another Palestinian youth, Mohammad Sawafta – a first-year university student – was also seriously injured by PA fire in the northwestern West Bank city of Tubas.
The football training academy where he used to coach shared his photo on Facebook on Wednesday.
[Translation: The family of Master Coach Athletic Academy wishes the coach in Tubas Mohammad Marai Sawafta a speedy recovery from his injury yesterday.]
Also, another Palestinian man, Ahmad Moeen al-Rimawi, 31, was killed in confrontations with Israeli forces in the village of Nabi Saleh east of Ramallah on Tuesday night, while at least 30 others were injured across the occupied West Bank.
'Let the people protest'
Thousands of people across the West Bank and Jerusalem had come out to attend protests on Tuesday night following the bombing of the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City that killed at least 500 people.
Images and videos aired by journalists at the scene showed countless bodies strewn across the ground and people carrying the limbs of their slain loves ones in cloth bags, on the 12th day of Israel's bombardment of Gaza.
Back in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, Israeli soldiers and settlers have also killed at least 62 Palestinians over the past 12 days in military raids and arrests in Palestinian neighbourhoods, towns and villages.
That escalating violence has sparked protests in Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus, Tubas, Hebron and Bethlehem against both the Palestinian Authority (PA) in city centres and Israeli forces at checkpoints, military bases and settlements.
PA security forces have cracked down on protesters with live ammunition, tear gas and stun grenades, with at least a dozen people injured, causing further outrage on Tuesday night.
In Ramallah, where the PA is based, protesters hurled rocks, chairs and other items at PA armoured vehicles attempting to disperse them. A widely-shared video appears to show a PA vehicle attempting to run over a protester.
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Jenin, a 37-year-old man who attended Tuesday's protest and who asked not to be named, said "it was a wave of anger against the people who are just standing by and taking a position of neutrality".
"About 80,000 PA officers are silent, while dozens of people are being killed in Gaza by the Israeli army and by settlers and the army in the West Bank," he continued.
"Security forces tried to disperse the protests, which led to confrontations with the demonstrators. The security forces fired live ammunition, which led to the martyrdom of a girl, and dozens of others injured," the man added.
In Nablus, a 45-year-old protester, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the people "demand the PA security forces protect the people in the face of this unprecedented Israeli attack whether from the army or settlers".
"If they are not able to – or do not want to – then the least they could do is to leave people to defend themselves. Let people protest and come out to express their anger without blocking them," he said.
The most common chant in protests has been: "Put the sword before the sword, we are the men of Mohammed Deif," in reference to the commander of Hamas military wing, the Qassam Brigades, but protests on Tuesday also   a call for PA President Mahmoud Abbas to step down.
The increasing confrontations and tensions with the PA, which many on the ground   as subcontractors for the Israeli occupation, are casting a shadow of fear and uncertainty over stability in the occupied West Bank.
On Tuesday night, the armed wing of Abbas's Fatah party, which operates independently, released a statement calling for Abbas to step down as the head of its Martyrs and Prisoners Commission.
"We give him until Thursday evening to hand over the tasks he has seized," it said, warning that "if he does not do so, he will become a legitimate target for strikes by our Palestinian armed groups and people," adding it would "lift the organisational and national cover off of him."
The Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a coalition of armed resistance groups, also called for "forming an emergency committee to pledge allegiance to Commander Marwan Barghouti, who lies in prison, as the supreme commander of the Palestinian revolutionary forces". Barghouti is a leading figure of the Palestinian resistance, who has often been tipped as a potential successor to Abbas within Fatah.
Protests continued on Wednesday afternoon, with PA forces again cracking down on demonstrators in Nablus.
Hospital attack
Later, an atmosphere of quiet tension set in on the West Bank on Wednesday morning, as schools, restaurants and stores shut their doors in observance of a general strike called for by officials and activists in response to the deaths at al-Ahli Arab Hospital.
"The massacre was indescribable. The majority of victims are children and women whose features have been wiped. Among the victims were people without heads, and torn up body parts," spokesperson for the Gaza health ministry, Ashraf al-Qidra, said in a press conference following the attack.
He said that the situation "has surpassed the capabilities of medical and emergency teams," adding that doctors are being forced to "carry out operations on the floor and corridors of the hospital", often without anaesthesia.
The humanitarian situation in the tiny coastal enclave, home to more than two million Palestinians,   prior to the attack on the hospital, with officials warning that there were only "24 hours of water, electricity and fuel left".
Residents of the besieged strip are also facing grave shortages of basic supplies including baby formula and flour, with most supermarkets running out of stock.
Israel has been imposing a land, sea and air blockade on the Gaza Strip for the past 17 years, in what has long been described as the "world's largest open-air prison". During this period, Israel has launched multiple large-scale assaults on the Strip, killing thousands of Palestinians.

Here is the   on Sunday, November 5, 2023:
Latest developments
More than 50 people were killed in the Israeli bombing of al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza and the Jabalia camp in the enclave's north.
Hamas's military wing Qassam Brigades said its fighters killed five more Israeli soldiers in northern Gaza during intense fighting on Saturday. In a statement, it said Qassam forces 'attacked a Zionist force holed up in a building northwest of Gaza City'.
The Israeli army has once again given civilians in the Gaza Strip a time window for Sunday to flee to the south of the coastal region. Traffic would be allowed on a southbound road between 10am and 2pm (08:00 GMT and 12:00 GMT) on Sunday, an Israeli army spokesperson wrote on the X platform, formerly Twitter, on Saturday evening. The army also published a map showing the designated road.
Qassam Brigades said on Saturday more than 60 hostages are missing after the latest Israeli air strikes on Gaza. Abu Obeida, spokesperson for the Brigades, also said on Hamas's telegram account that 23 bodies of Israeli hostages were trapped under the rubble.
Many demonstrations continued to be held across the globe in support of Palestinians. Large protests were organised in Washington, London, Paris, Berlin and elsewhere on Saturday and Sunday. Demonstrators also rallied inside Israel, including outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home, to call for the release of captives in Gaza and for the prime minister to resign.
Human impact and fighting
At least 9,488 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air strikes on Gaza since the October 7 Hamas attack, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.
Israeli forces on Sunday killed three Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, raising the death toll to 151 since October 7.
A rights group says thousands of Palestinians from Gaza who worked inside Israel have had their permits revoked and many were detained and subject to inhumane treatment. Ramallah-based Al-Haq said it documented 'punitive measures, arbitrary detention, and degrading treatment of Palestinian workers from Gaza who were present inside the Green Line' on October 7.
Diplomacy
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has rebuffed the calls for a Gaza ceasefire by Arab leaders. Jordanian and Egyptian leaders want an immediate ceasefire, but Blinken said he would back only a 'humanitarian pause' to provide a window for supplies to come in and some civilians to get out. Blinken is set to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Sunday during his third diplomatic trip to the Middle East within a month.
The Palestinian foreign ministry has welcomed Turkey's recalling of its ambassador to Israel for consultations due to the humanitarian situation in Gaza, calling it an 'extension of Istanbul's support for the rights and safety of our people'.
Israel said it shows Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is 'siding with the Hamas terrorist organisation'.
Iran is staying active on its diplomacy initiative as well, with Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian holding a phone call with his Iraqi counterpart on Saturday night to discuss 'genocide' in Gaza.

Israel's war in Gaza revives Sabra and Shatila massacre memories in Lebanon

October 24th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Beirut, Lebanon – Zaineb Saab locked the door to her house and did not dare make a sound when the killing started in  , two neighbourhoods home to a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon's capital Beirut.
On September 16, 1982, members of a far-right-wing Christian militia, Phalange Party, coordinated with Israeli forces to kill between 2,000 and 3,500 Muslim Lebanese and Palestinian civilians.
Saab said during the carnage, which  , she heard her neighbours screaming but no gunshots. Most victims were butchered with knives.
'They were going straight into people's homes and killing them,' Saab told Al Jazeera from Sabra.
More than four decades later, Saab and other survivors say that Israel's ongoing bombardment of Gaza is triggering them to relive those terrible days in Sabra and Shatila. More than four decades later, Saab and other survivors say Israel's ongoing bombardment of Gaza is triggering their worst memories, making them relive those terrible days for Sabra and Shatila.
The massacre is considered one of the most harrowing episodes of violence against Palestinian refugees since they were expelled from their homeland during the creation of Israel in 1948.
But residents of   and Shatila say that what they lived through then does not compare with the shocking violence unfolding in Gaza now.
More than 5,700 Palestinians have been killed in 18 days of bombing, including more than 2,000 children. More than half of Gaza's population is displaced, and much of its homes and infrastructure — schools, universities and hospitals — is damaged or destroyed in Israeli bombing since October 7, when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel, killing 1,400 people.
'As we watch what is happening in Gaza, we remember the massacre here. But it's not the same. Gaza is worse,' Saab said.
Lost childhood
At Majdi Majzoub's home in the camp, dramatic scenes of Palestinian children being rescued from the rubble after Israeli air attacks destroyed their homes in Gaza played out on television.
It transported him back to the time when, 41 years ago, he was among the survivors of an Israeli massacre.
Majzoub was 10 years old at the time. In June 1982, Israel launched a full-scale invasion to expel the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) from Lebanon, where it was based. Israel also planned to install a puppet government headed by the Phalange Party.
By September 1, the PLO relocated to Tunisia while a multinational force was deployed to protect civilians in Sabra and Shatila. The task force curiously left after just 10 days, enabling Israel to besiege the camp.
Two weeks later, Majzoub said, the Israelis deployed more tanks and vehicles around the camp. The increased military presence came two days after the mysterious assassination of the Phalange Party leader, Bashir Gemayel.
At the time, nobody knew who killed Gemayel. Yet members of his party blamed Palestinians, and they were hungry for revenge.
When the killing started in Sabra and Shatila, Majzoub said he saw an Israeli helicopter fly over the camp to guide the Phalange fighters as they murdered civilians.
He also remembers hiding in a mosque with his siblings where they kept quiet and still, so they would not be heard.
'There were about 200 people hiding with us,' Majzoub told Al Jazeera. 'I remember a group of young men who left the mosque to try and explain that there were no [PLO] fighters in the camp. All those young men died.'
Later that night, Majzoub and his siblings escaped the camp and reunited with their parents, who were visiting relatives elsewhere in Beirut when the massacre unfolded.
Looking back, Majzoub considers himself lucky compared with civilians in Gaza, which rights groups describe as an 'open-air prison" where 2.2 million people are restricted from leaving the territory without hard-to-get Israeli or Egyptian permission.
Israel has tightened its chokehold-like siege on Gaza further by cutting off fuel, water and food supplies since Hamas's surprise attack on October 7. Israel's tactic may amount to a war crime, according to experts of international humanitarian law.
'Palestinians in Sabra and Shatila were uprooted from their homes in 1948 like the Palestinians in Gaza,' Majzoub, 51, said. 'The Israelis tried to finish us off in 1982. They are now trying to do the same to Palestinians in Gaza.'
Another genocide
In December 1982, the United Nations General Assembly declared  the Sabra and Shatila massacre an '#8216;act of genocide'.
The Phalange murdered pregnant women and ripped out their foetuses, according to witnesses and journalists.
One Palestinian survivor, who goes by the name of Abou Ahmed, said he vividly remembers people's bodies piling up on the winding and narrow streets of the camp.
He added that he risked his life to carry the injured on stretchers to Dahiya, a nearby neighbourhood in south Beirut.
'They were killing everybody and doing it randomly,' he told Al Jazeera from his home in Shatila. 'I blame the Israelis. They were the ones that were supposed to protect the camp.'
Abou Ahmed added that if it was not for a few journalists, then nobody would have known what happened in Sabra and Shatila.
He always believed that if more people knew that a massacre was happening in real time, then the world would intervene to stop it. But the ongoing violence in Gaza has changed his mind, he said.
'The whole world is protesting, but nobody is responding or doing anything,' he told Al Jazeera.
United States President Joe Biden and European Union President Ursula von der Leyen have provided full diplomatic support for Israel's indiscriminate offensive, even as the UN has warned that Palestinians face the real risk of genocide.
Saab, Majzoub and Abou Ahmed agree with the UN's assessment.
'This isn't a massacre in Gaza. It's a genocide,' said Abou Ahmed, from his home in Shatila. 'It's the worst violence we have ever seen in Palestinian history.'

Canadian journalism school unveiling award in honour of Shireen Abu Akleh

September 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
One of Canada's top journalism schools is inaugurating an award in honour of Palestinian journalist  , whose killing by Israeli forces last year sent shockwaves around the world and spurred calls for justice and media freedom.
The Shireen Abu Akleh Emerging Reporter Award in Social Justice Journalism at Carleton University will be unveiled at an event in the Canadian capital, Ottawa, on Friday evening.
"Such scholarships will maintain her legacy, will maintain her name," Abu Akleh's brother, Tony Abu Akleh, said in a statement  shared by the university.
"Awards like these, which honor Shireen and her contributions to journalism and her commitment to giving voice to those who live under brutal military occupation, are a way to keep her memory alive and let young journalists continue her legacy," he added.
"And that legacy was speaking truth to power and shining a light on both the pain of injustice and the perseverance of those who live under it."
Abu Akleh, a   who worked with Al Jazeera for more than two decades, was killed in May 2022 while reporting on an Israeli military raid in Jenin, a city in the north of the occupied West Bank.
Israel initially claimed that Abu Akleh may have been shot in a crossfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian fighters.
But video footage, several witnesses and   by rights groups and independent media outlets showed there were no armed Palestinians in the area where Abu Akleh and other journalists were standing before Israeli soldiers started firing at them.
Israel eventually admitted that one of its soldiers likely killed the Palestinian-American journalist, but said that no criminal investigation would be conducted.
On the anniversary of Abu Akleh's death in May, a group of United Nations experts raised alarm at the lack of accountability in the case.
"After a year, Israeli authorities have failed to hold the perpetrators of Abu Akleh's killing accountable, while independent investigations have pointed at the culpability of Israeli forces. Justice remains, again, hostage of politics," the experts said .
"International law demands, at minimum: an effective, thorough, independent, impartial and transparent investigation into Abu Akleh's death."
Monia Mazigh, a Canadian author and one of the initial donors supporting the new award at Carleton University, told Al Jazeera that having the journalist's name associated with the prize "is very symbolic".
Mazigh said Abu Akleh was well known across North Africa and the Middle East for her coverage of Palestine and the wider region, and had "dedicated her life" to bringing critical issues to light.
The award will also give younger journalists a chance to follow in Abu Akleh's footsteps, Mazigh added.
Students have to submit a proposal for a project that aims to "shed light on an important social justice issue" to apply, the Canadian university has said, adding that it hopes to offer at least $5,000 per year "in perpetuity".
For Mazigh, that means Abu Akleh's work "will continue through other people".
"I think it will be a great opportunity for young journalists or for aspiring journalists not only to have a role model, but also to go on the ground and do some real work … related to social justice," she said.

More than 20 patients die at Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital amid Israeli raid

More than 20 patients have died at Gaza's   in the last two days as Israeli forces continue to raid the facility, according to a hospital official and the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza.
The health ministry said on Friday that 24 patients died over the past 48 hours due to power cuts at the hospital, which has been out of service since Saturday amid a fuel shortage.
"Twenty-four patients in different departments have died over the last 48 hours as vital medical equipment has stopped functioning because of the power outage," said health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra on Friday.
Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital, told Al Jazeera that 22 patients had died overnight.
The health facility has become the focus of Israel's ground offensive in northern Gaza, with special forces combing through the facility since Wednesday amid growing international alarm about the fate of the hundreds of patients and thousands of civilians seeking shelter there.
Israel has alleged that Hamas fighters are using a tunnel complex beneath the hospital to stage attacks. Hamas and hospital officials have repeatedly denied the claims.
Israel said its forces had found a vehicle with a large number of weapons, and an underground structure it called a Hamas tunnel shaft, after two days searching the premises.
The army also said it had found the bodies of two hostages in buildings near, though not inside, the hospital grounds.
The Palestinian health ministry said the raid has destroyed medical services in the hospital, where the UN estimated 2,300 patients, staff and displaced Palestinians were sheltering before Israeli troops moved in.
Al-Shifa staff said a premature baby died at the hospital on Friday, the first baby to die there in the two days since Israeli forces entered.
Three had died in the previous days while the hospital was surrounded by Israeli forces.
Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of al-Shifa Hospital, told Al Jazeera that the medical compound has become a 'big prison' and a 'mass grave' for all those inside.
'We are left with nothing - no power, no food, no water. With every passing minute, we are losing a life. Overnight, we lost 22 persons, [and] for the past three days, the hospital has been kept under siege,' Salmiya said.

Dire lack of fuel
Israel imposed a strict blockade and launched a military assault on Gaza last month after Hamas carried out an attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, and taking about 240 others hostage, according to Israeli officials.
The Israeli air and ground assault has killed more than 12,000 people, including 5,000 children, according to Palestinian authorities in Gaza.
Now in its seventh week, the Israeli siege has severely restricted supplies of food, water, electricity and fuel to the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip, with aid agencies warning of a humanitarian crisis in the territory.
Israel has said it has agreed to a US request to allow two fuel trucks a day into Gaza, following a UN warning that the shortages had halted aid deliveries and put people at risk of starvation. The amount is about half of what the UN said it needs to conduct lifesaving functions for hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza, including fuelling water systems, hospitals, bakeries and its trucks delivering aid.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said earlier that its aid trucks were unable to enter Gaza from Egypt for a second straight day on Friday due to the lack of fuel and a near-total communications blackout that began on Thursday.
UNRWA said it would be unable to "manage or coordinate humanitarian convoys" because of the telecommunications outage.
[Al Jazeera]
Near total collapse
More than half of Gaza's hospitals are no longer functional due to combat, damage or shortages, and Israel's raid on al-Shifa left extensive damage to the radiology, burns and dialysis units, Hamas said.
Conditions for Palestinian civilians are rapidly deteriorating, the UN warned.
More than 1.5 million people have been internally displaced, and Israel's blockade of the territory means "civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation", World Food Programme head Cindy McCain said.
UNRWA said 70 percent of people have no access to clean water in south Gaza, where raw sewage had started to flow on the streets.
UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini described children sheltering at a UN school "pleading for a sip of water, or for a loaf of bread".

Water a 'matter of life and death' for Gaza Strip, says UN agency

The United Nations refugee agency for Palestinians has said water has now become a 'matter of life and death' for people in the Gaza Strip after  .
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said on Saturday that more than two million people are now at risk as water runs out.
'It has become a matter of life and death. It is a must: fuel needs to be delivered now into Gaza to make water available for two million people,' said UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini.
No humanitarian supplies have been allowed into Gaza for a week now, according to the agency.
Clean water is running out in the Gaza Strip as its water plant and public water networks stopped working. Palestinians are now forced to use dirty water from wells, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases.
Israel has also enforced an electricity blackout on Gaza since Wednesday, which has impacted the water supply.
Meanwhile, thousands have moved out of northern Gaza after Israel ordered them to do so amid its air attacks, something the UN called 'impossible'. Nearly one million people have been displaced since last week.
'We need to truck fuel into Gaza now. Fuel is the only way for people to have safe drinking water. If not, people will start dying of severe dehydration, among them young children, the elderly and women. Water is now the last remaining lifeline. I appeal for the siege on humanitarian assistance to be lifted now,' added Lazzarini.
Last Friday, the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched a surprise multi-pronged assault on Israel, which killed at least 1,300 people.
Israel then began pounding the enclave of Gaza, dropping thousands of bombs that have killed at least 2,215 Palestinians.
UNRWA also said its shelters in Gaza are no longer safe, something it called 'unprecedented'.
'Wars have rules. Civilians, hospitals, schools, clinics and United Nations premises cannot be a target. UNRWA is sparing no efforts to advocate with parties to the conflicts to meet their obligations under international law to protect civilians including those seeking refuge in UNRWA shelters,' it said.
'This war should be no exception. Protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure including UN buildings applies to this conflict, too.'
Efforts are under way by organisations and governments to deliver humanitarian assistance to many, including hundreds of thousands of children, who urgently need it.

Israeli air strikes kill dozens in Gaza overnight, Palestinian sources say

Israeli air strikes on Gaza have killed dozens of people overnight, according to Palestinian medical sources and media.
At least 15 people were killed in air raids on the city of Khan Younis, southern Gaza, a medical source told Al Jazeera early on Friday.
The Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that journalist Yasser Abu Namous and his mother were among those killed in the pre-dawn strikes.
At least 30 others were killed in attacks on residential neighbourhoods in northern and central Gaza, WAFA said.
At least 10 people were killed in a strike on a four-storey house in the al-Zaytoun neighbourhood, southeast of Gaza City, while eight others were killed in air raids on Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, WAFA said.
Another 12 people, including a child, were killed in a Israeli strike in Rafah, WAFA said.
Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the latest casualty figures.
Four people were also killed after Israeli forces carried out a pre-dawn attack in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian sources told Al Jazeera.
Al Jazeera's Nida Ibrahim, who is reporting from Ramallah, said that one of those killed was a member of armed group, the Jenin Battalion.
More than 7,000 Palestinians, including nearly 3,000 children, have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on Hamas, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.
Israel has pledged to eliminate Hamas in response to the armed group's unprecedented October 7 attacks, which Israeli officials say killed at least 1,405 people, mostly civilians.
The death toll from the fighting between Israel and Hamas has become a source of contention amid claims and counter-claims about the true number of casualties.
United States President Joe Biden earlier this week cast doubt over the figures, saying that he has 'no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using'.
Gaza's health ministry on Thursday released a list of more than 7,000 names that was paired with government identification numbers to support its accuracy.

Analysis: Israel's deadlines to Gaza's Palestinians have failed

The Israeli call for civilians to evacuate the northern half of the Gaza Strip does not seem to have produced the desired results as of yet.
Nobody knows what the primary intention of the announcement made on Friday was, but whatever it was, it fell short of anything that could be called full Israeli success.
Israel has been in near-constant armed conflict with Palestinians since that state was proclaimed in 1948. For three-quarters of a century, the two sides have been trying to outsmart and outgun each other. The first step in that is to know one's enemy.
The conventional belief was that Israel was so successful in penetrating Arab political and military structures that everybody discounted the possibility of a strategic surprise like the one it suffered in the   when Egyptian and Syrian armed forces launched a surprise coordinated attack against it.
Totally shocked Israel was on the brink of defeat but managed to recover, with significant aid from the United States, which sent over 8,000 tonnes of military supplies by air in less than a week. Israel vowed not to get caught unaware ever again and invested heavily in agents, informants, moles, analysts, and sophisticated surveillance and spying techniques.
Then came Saturday, October 7, 2023, which brutally sent to the scrapheap Israeli reputation of omnipotence and the notion that it would know in advance every move Palestinians would make. The Israeli defence and security establishment will study that failure for years, and all Israelis know a huge mistake was made and everyone hopes it will be the last one.

They may be wrong. The evacuation directive may be a sign that Israel has not fully consolidated and that the order was not preceded by deep scrutiny.
In most conventional military situations, sowing panic among a civilian population will unavoidably reflect on the military. Soldiers seeing their relatives, friends and neighbours flee in panic inevitably ask themselves: 'Who am I then to fight for?'
Once civilians leave, the military wonders if it is worth dying for empty land. Thus, one aim of the evacuation order could have been the desire to produce that trigger effect.
When civilians flee in panic they block communication lines, making it difficult for the fighting units to manoeuvre, bring reinforcements from the rear and keep the front line supplied with ammunition.
Gaza Strip is what its name says - a thin sliver of land less than 10km (6 miles) wide in the northern part, with an extremely dense network of unplanned and unregulated housing and traffic that is chaotic traffic even without war.
Israel dropped leaflets telling civilians to use the two main north-south roads, the coastal road and Salah al-Din Road further inland. Crowds on those thoroughfares would deny the Palestinian fighters the ability to move towards the north, against the human flow.

Either aim, creating demoralisation or denying military movement, follows classic military logic, so whichever Israel intended as the main purpose would be a good military move in a fight with a regular army that operates on standard military practices. In the case of Hamas, they are almost worthless militarily and indicate a deep and worrying planning failure.
The armed wing of Hamas operates like a guerrilla unit, not a regular army. Its soldiers are not stationed in classical barracks from where they would deploy as needed through public infrastructure. There is no rear in the military sense, a safe territory well behind front lines with warehouses full of military hardware. Hamas shares almost nothing with regular armies, and Israel should know it.
The Palestinian fighters are of the people. They only wear uniforms when they want to send a propaganda message, like during the incursion into Israel. In Gaza, they move around unnoticed when they are walking around. But they don't need to do that very often - they enjoy an enormous network of tunnels that offers solid protection from explosions and is invisible to surveillance aircraft and drones.
 
Even when they run away, worried for their lives due to indiscriminate bombing by the Israeli air force, the civilians of Gaza do not appear to fall into the ultimate stage of fear, a collective panic that defies any reasoning.
If Israel wanted to create that uncontrollable fright as a primer to defeat and surrender, it failed. If the rationale of the order was to impede Hamas and make it militarily ineffective, it also failed.

'True massacre': Gaza children death toll crosses 4,000 as raids intensify

At least 4,008 children have been killed in the ongoing war in Gaza as the death toll after nearly a month of Israeli bombings hits 9,770, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
On Sunday afternoon, an Israeli air strike hit several houses near a school at the Bureji refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 13 people, according to officials at Al-Aqsa Hospital.
The camp is home to an estimated 46,000 people and was struck last Thursday as well.
Footage verified by Al Jazeera on Sunday showed people searching under the rubble of houses to retrieve the victims.
It was the third refugee camp to be hit by Israeli air strikes in the past 24 hours. More than 50 Palestinians were killed in attacks on Gaza's al-Maghazi and Jabalia refugee camps.

'True massacre'
Arafat Abu Mashaia, a resident of al-Maghazi camp, said the Israeli air strike flattened several multi-storey homes where people forced out of other parts of Gaza were sheltering.
"It was a true massacre," he said early on Sunday as he stood on the wreckage of destroyed homes. "All here are peaceful people. I challenge anyone who says there were resistance [fighters] here."
The camp, a built-up residential area, is located in the evacuation zone where Israel's military had urged Palestinian civilians to seek refuge as it focuses its   on the north.
Saeed al-Nejma, 53, said he was asleep with his family when the blast hit the neighbourhood. "All night, I and the other men were trying to pick the dead from the rubble. We got children, dismembered, torn apart flesh," he said.
Israeli planes again dropped leaflets, urging people to head south of Gaza during a four-hour window on Sunday. Crowds of people were seen walking down the strip's main north-south highway on foot with only what they could carry in their arms. Others led donkey carts.
One man said he had to walk 500 metres (1,640 feet) with hands raised while passing Israeli troops. Another described seeing bodies in damaged cars along the road.
"The children saw tanks for the first time. Oh world, have mercy on us," said one Palestinian who declined to give his name.
Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis, said there seems to be a "systematic attack" on Gaza's refugee camps by Israeli forces.
'These repeated air strikes on refugee camps in central and southern Gaza are the reason why people are not taking the Israeli announcement of guaranteeing safe corridors to travel to the south seriously,' he said.
According to the United Nations, 1.5 million people are now internally displaced in Gaza out of a population of 2.3 million.
The strikes and displacement come as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank on Sunday.
Blinken   Washington's position calling for '  ' in Gaza to protect civilians and allow foreign nationals to leave while 'still enabling Israel to achieve its objective' to defeat Hamas.
Both Egypt and Jordan rebuked that position publicly at a news conference on Saturday, instead calling for an immediate ceasefire – echoing the stance of other leaders in the region.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rejected the idea of halting the offensive, ignoring appeals and  .
"There will be no ceasefire without the return of our hostages, we say this to both our enemies and our friends. We will continue until we beat them," Netanyahu told air and ground crews at the Ramon Air Force Base in southern Israel on Sunday.
Israel says it is targeting Hamas fighters and assets, accusing the group of using civilians as human shields. Critics say Israel's strikes are disproportionate, considering the large number of civilians killed.

Biden says US 'holds world together' as he condemns Putin and Hamas

October 20th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
United States President Joe Biden has said he will ask Congress for more money to support Israel and Ukraine, asserting in an impassioned speech that both nations were fighting enemies of democracy.
Speaking to Americans from the Oval Office, Biden sought to make a link between the actions of Hamas in Israel and those of Russian president Vladimir Putin who sent his troops into Ukraine for a full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Biden said stopping such aggression was crucial not only for the security of the US but also for the wider world.
"Hamas and Putin represent different threats but they share this in common; they both want to annihilate a neighbouring democracy," he said.
He said if the US walked away and aggressors succeeded, others might be "emboldened to try the same" spreading the risk of conflict to other parts of the world.
"American leadership is what holds the world together," the president said during the 10-minute speech, only the second he has made from the Oval Office during his administration. "American alliances are what keep us, America, safe. American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with."
Biden was speaking hours after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv, where he reiterated US support for Israel  even amid its total blockade of Gaza and relentless bombardment of the Palestinian enclave of 2.3 million people.
The visit had been meant to include a meeting with Arab leaders but the talks were cancelled after Gaza's Al-Ahli Arab Hospital was hit hours before, killing some 500 people.
Amid calls for a ceasefire, Biden was able to secure a commitment from Israel and Egypt to open the Rafah crossing for desperately needed humanitarian aid.
Biden said he would be lodging an urgent request to Congress to support Israel and Ukraine on Friday. He did not put a value to the security package but previous reports have suggested it could be as much as $100bn.
Biden's address comes amid paralysis in Congress where Republicans, who control the lower house, have struggled to appoint  a new House of Representatives Speaker after removing Kevin McCarthy earlier this month.
He said the US needed to rise above "petty, partisan, angry politics" and meet its responsibilities.
"It's a smart investment that will pay dividends for American security for generations," he stressed.
'Tragic loss'
The conflict in Gaza erupted on October 7, when Hamas launched a surprise attack against Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking dozens captive.
At least 3,785 Palestinians have been killed in the bombing campaign.
Biden accused Hamas of unleashing "pure, unadulterated evil" on the world, and stressed that there was "'no higher priority" for him as president than bringing home the US citizens being held by the armed group.
While making clear his support for Israel, Biden said he was "heartbroken" by the "tragic loss" of Palestinian lives and that he had spoken with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to reiterate that the US remains "committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and right to self-determination".
He stressed the urgent need for humanitarian assistance to the enclave and noted the agreement secured to get food, water and medicine into Gaza.
"We cannot give up on peace," he said. "We cannot give up on the two-state solution. Israel and the Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity and peace."
Biden's speech at the Oval Office came after he again reassured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of US support for Kyiv in its bid to push Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.
He noted that the US was an "essential" part of a group of about 50 countries that have backed Ukraine since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.
Will make sure Ukraine has the "weapons they need to defend themselves", he said, stressing to his domestic audience that there were no plans to send US troops to Eastern Europe.
"When Putin invaded Ukraine he thought he could take Kyiv and the whole of Ukraine in a matter of days, but Putin has failed, and he will continue to fail," Biden said. "Kyiv still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Ukraine has regained more than 50 percent of the territory Russian troops once occupied."

Israel-Hamas four-day truce starts: How day one unfolded

November 24th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
After 48 days of war and bombardment that took thousands of lives,   in the Israel-Gaza war began on Friday with captives released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
Here is what we know about day one:
Captives and prisoners release
During the four days of truce, at least 50 captives are expected to be freed, leaving an estimated 190 captives in Gaza. In exchange, 150 Palestinians prisoners are expected to be released.
On Friday,  , including 10 Thai nationals, one Filipino and 13 Israeli women and children were released. In exchange, 24 Palestinian women — including two 18-year-olds — and 15 boys who were held as prisoners in Israel were released.
The captives were transferred out of Gaza and handed over to Egyptian authorities at the Rafah border crossing, accompanied by eight staff members of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in a four-car convoy, the ICRC said.
Earlier on Friday,   combat between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters halted for the first time in seven weeks under the truce. No big bombings, or artillery or rocket attacks were reported, although Hamas and Israel both accused each other of sporadic shootings.
Both said the war would resume at full throttle as soon as the truce was over.
On day one this is how things unfolded:
Thailand:
Thailand's Prime Minister  Srettha Thavisin was the first to announce the release of some captives. He said his government received confirmation that some Thai workers held in Gaza were released by Hamas.
A total of 10 Thai nationals were released. At least 23 Thai workers are believed to be taken as captives into Gaza during the October 7 attack, in addition to 32 Thai workers who were killed during the assault.
The release of the Thais, who were all men, is believed to be unrelated to the truce negotiations and followed a separate track of talks with Hamas mediated by Egypt and Qatar.
The Thai nationals "will be taken to Shamir Medical Center (Assaf Harofeh), where they will be met by Embassy officials. They are required to be under medical supervision for a period of 48 hours, without access to outsiders," Thailand's foreign ministry said.
Israel:
About half an hour later (around 14:23 GMT), the other captives were released, Hamas officials told AFP.
At 6:06pm in Gaza (16:06 GMT) the ICRC confirmed that 24 captives were released .
At 7:17pm (17:17 GMT) the Israeli military said that its forces  were currently with the released captives. "They will continue to be accompanied by [Israeli] soldiers as they make their way to Israeli hospitals, where they will be reunited with their families," they added.
A full list of the Israeli captives released on Friday is available  .
Speaking to Al Jazeera, Haaretz columnist Gideon Levy said most Israelis were watching images of the captives being released on their television screens.
"There is a mixture of emotion, on one hand, there is the most simple basic happiness for families getting reunited … but every Israeli knows that this is just the beginning," Levy said.
"I think the nation's sentiment right now is very clear, and is very general: Israelis want all the hostages back at any price, except for very radical right groups… and it means an extended ceasefire, because everyone understands that you cannot get back to the war with the same intensity and expect more deals," he explained.

Palestine:
At 7:34pm (17:34 GMT) , Qatar confirmed the release of 39 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails.
As part of a negotiated truce between Hamas and Israel, the group was transferred to Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank, where families gathered outside are waiting anxiously for their return home.
  who was arrested in 2015 when she was 16 years old, has been released from Ofer Prison. She was among the first batch of Palestinian women and children who were released as part of the truce agreement.
Bakeer told Al Jazeera many of the released prisoners need medical attention. 'All of the prisoners suffered a high level of medical neglect [while detained],' she said. Bakeer was shot in the arm while being arrested.
A complete list of the Palestinian prisoners released on Friday is available  .
According to Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera's senior political analyst, this could the beginning of something positive.
"If the agreement works today, it means it could definitely work in the following few days," Bishara said.
"This is the other side to the darkness that has befallen Gaza and somewhat Israel over the past 50 days … so it's important for us to look at this, regardless of how short and how complicated it is, and see it as what is possible and why ending this war is so important," he added.

International aid
More than 200 trucks carrying aid and fuel have entered Gaza,   to Gaza since the start of the war.
What's the situation in Gaza?
In Khan Younis town in southern Gaza, streets filled with people venturing out of home and shelters into a landscape of buildings flattened into heaps of rubble.
Displaced families with small children carried belongings in plastic bags, hoping to return at least temporarily to homes they had abandoned earlier in the war.
"I am now very happy, I feel at ease. I am going back to my home, our hearts are rested," said Ahmad Wael, smiling as he walked carrying a mattress balanced on his head. "I am very tired of sitting without any food or water. There [at home] we can live, we drink tea, make bread."
In northern Gaza's combat zone, viewed from across the fence in southern Israel, there was no sign of the warplanes that have thundered through the sky for weeks, explosions on the ground or the contrails of Hamas rocketfire. Just one plume of smoke was visible in the early afternoon.
Columns of Israeli tanks rolled away from the Gaza Strip's northern end in the morning, while aid trucks entered from Egypt at the southern end.

More than 700 killed in overnight Israeli attacks, Gaza officials say

More than 700 Palestinians were killed in overnight Israeli air raids on Gaza, according to Palestinian officials, the highest 24-hour death toll since Israel began bombarding the the besieged territory earlier this month.
The Israeli military said on Tuesday it hit more than 400 "Hamas targets" and killed dozens of Hamas fighters in the attacks, and warned that it would take time to achieve its aim of destroying the Palestinian group.
Israel launched an assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters killed at least 1,400 people in a surprise attack on southern Israel on October 7.
The health ministry in Gaza, which is governed by Hamas, has said at least 5,791 Palestinians, including 2,360 children, have been killed in the Israeli assault.
Ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said the overnight attacks produced the biggest influx of deaths in 24 hours.

'Thousands of families have been instantly displaced; its just full of rubble and debris everywhere,' said Al Jazeera's Youmna ElSayed, reporting from Gaza.
'You can hear the sound of drones and Israeli jets in the sky. Everyone says, everyone feels that there is no safe place in the Strip to be in anymore'.
The Israeli military said it killed three Hamas deputy commanders in the attacks.
Witnesses and health officials said many of the air raids hit residential buildings, some of them in southern Gaza where Israel had told civilians to take shelter.
One overnight attack levelled a four-storey residential building in the southern city of Khan Younis, killing at least 32 people and wounding dozens of others, survivors told The Associated Press news agency.
In Gaza City, at least 19 people were killed when an air raid hit the house of the Bahloul family, according to survivors, who said dozens more people remained buried. Workers pulled at least two children out of the collapsed building.
[Al Jazeera]
Aid trucks
In addition to bombarding the territory, Israel has cut access to food, water, medicine and fuel in a "complete siege".
More than 40 medical centres have stopped operations due to the shortages and the damage caused by the bombing, the health ministry spokesperson said.
Several aid trucks have crossed from Egypt to Gaza since Sunday, but the United Nations has warned of a "humanitarian catastrophe" if aid shipments were not ramped up significantly.
Jeremey Laurence, spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), said, 'The aid which resumed from Egypt over the weekend is a mere drop in the ocean of what is needed.'
Fuel, which has been left out of the deliveries due to the agreement with Israel, was crucial, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) said.
'Fuel is extremely urgent because, without fuel, the trucks themselves cannot move,' UNRWA spokesperson Tamara Alrifai said. 'Without fuel, the generators cannot produce electricity for hospitals, for bakeries and for the water desalination plant'.
UN humanitarian agencies said on Tuesday they were on their 'knees' pleading for unimpeded aid to enter Gaza.

Israel's military has closed in on the front gates of Gaza's  , where thousands of injured and displaced people are trapped amid intensive Israeli bombardment.
Israeli forces had fully encircled the al-Shifa Hospital as of early on Saturday morning, preventing ambulances from entering or leaving the facility, where medical supplies and food are running low.
"They are attacking and destroying the front gates of the main medical complex in the Gaza Strip as patients and thousands of Palestinians are still residing inside the yard of this hospital," Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum said.
"Those people are really trapped right now by Israeli forces who are stationed in different sectors encircling the entire place. They are no longer able to move ambulances to bring victims and wounded people from the areas targeted. People are trapped and they lack food."
Abu Azzoum said that Israeli snipers and artillery were also targeting anyone moving outside the hospital.
Al-Shifa director Muhammad Abu Salmiya described the area around the hospital as a 'battlefield', but said the hospital's staff have pledged to stay with patients until the 'last moment'.
'We will not leave, because we know if we leave the hospital, dozens of patients will die,' Abu Salmiya told Al Jazeera.
The escalating bombardment comes after an  , according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-governed enclave.
Health officials said later on Friday that Israeli tanks were closing in on at least four hospitals in northern Gaza from all directions.
As fighting escalated on Friday night, Marwan Jilani, director general of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, condemned Israel for attacking hospitals at the UN Security Council in New York.
'Displaced people at the hospitals are getting shot at as we speak,' Jilani said.
'They are asking, 'What can we do? Where can we go?' Thousands of innocent lives are under imminent threat.'
World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus echoed his concerns, saying he was 'extremely disturbed' by the situation at the al-Shifa Hospital.
'Many of the thousands sheltering at the hospital are forced to evacuate due to security risks, while many still remain there,' he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
'WHO is very concerned about the safety of patients, health workers and those sheltering in hospitals. They need immediate protection."
We are extremely disturbed by reports of airstrikes in the vicinity of Al-Shifa hospital in #Gaza . Many health workers we were in contact with have been forced to leave the hospital in search of safety. Others report being unable to move due to grave insecurity. Many of the

Israel has claimed the hospital is used by Hamas as a command centre, which both the al-Shifa staff and the armed group have denied.
The area around al-Shifa has been bombed at least five times since Thursday, according to Gaza health officials, while Israeli forces have also struck al-Nasr Medical Centre, al-Quds Hospital and al-Rantisi Hospital.
The WHO has confirmed that half of Gaza's 36 hospitals are not functioning and two-thirds of its primary care facilities are out of commission amid the fighting.
At least 11,078 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, according to Palestinian health officials.
More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas in the armed group's surprise attacks on Israel on October 7, according to Israeli officials.

British PM Sunak in Israel. What's on his agenda?

October 19th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Thursday landed in Tel Aviv to "express solidarity with the Israeli people" as non-stop Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip destroyed residential buildings and killed more than 3,400 Palestinians.
'I want you to know that the United Kingdom and I stand with you,' Sunak said as his country has firmly stood behind Israel in the wake of the Hamas attack on Israeli soil that killed more than 1,400 people. Hamas also took at least 199 people captive.
The trip comes as the mounting death toll has triggered  , with fears the Israel-Palestine conflict may escalate into a  .
Sunak's office told the Reuters news agency he would be 'sharing his condolences' for the loss of life in both Israel and Gaza, warning against further escalation.
His visit will see him perform a delicate balancing act, with any missteps likely to inflame tensions. Here's a look at Britain's involvement in the region.
What is Britain's position on the conflict?
Britain has so far lent staunch support to Israel, with Sunak calling the Hamas attack 'a pogrom'.
'This atrocity was an existential strike at the very idea of Israel as a safe homeland of the Jewish people,' Sunak told the House of Commons on Monday.
He urged Israel to 'go after Hamas, take back the hostages, deter further incursions, and strengthen its security for the long term'.
'This must be done in line with international humanitarian law, but also recognising that they face a vicious enemy that embeds itself behind civilians,' he said.
Britain's decision to abstain from yesterday's   on a resolution calling for Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza largely passed below the radar. The resolution was blocked by the United States on the basis that it did not explicitly mention Israel's right to self-defence.
Having declined to take a position on Wednesday, Sunak is nevertheless expected to push for the humanitarian corridor through the   with Egypt.
With Sunak's Conservative Party currently slumping in the polls, the Labour Party is eyeing a victory in general elections widely expected to be held next year.
Labour leader   has so far struck a similar tone to Sunak on the Israel-Gaza conflict, but faces mutiny within his own party after comments last week that suggested he supported Israel's 'right' to cut off power and water supplies to Gaza's 2.3 million people.
Rights groups say the Israeli siege of Gaza amounts to collective punishment and a war crime.
What is Britain's history in Palestine?
Ask most Palestinians what lies at the root of their plight and they'll likely blame Arthur Balfour.
It was back in 1917, while serving as Britain's foreign secretary, that Balfour pledged to create a 'national home' for Jewish people in Palestine in the  .
Britain had been in charge of Palestine - home to a Jewish minority and an Arab majority – since defeating the Ottoman Empire in World War I.
After the Balfour Declaration, Jewish people fleeing persecution in Europe started arriving in greater numbers, particularly during the Nazi Holocaust in World War II.
Britain withdrew in 1948, when Jewish leaders announced the creation of the State of Israel and Jewish militias went on a rampage against Palestinians forcing them to flee.
About 750,000 Palestinians were displaced in a campaign of ethnic cleansing, some ending up in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, and the rest squeezed into the remaining territory in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Palestinians call the forced displacement "Nakba" or catastrophe. In 1967, Israel captured the remaining Palestinian territories – a step not recognised by the international community.
What is Britain's relationship with Israel?
Britain has a strong relationship with Israel, but the two allies don't always agree on some foreign policy issues.
In March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu   for talks with Sunak, with Iran topping the agenda. While Britain has imposed sanctions on Israel's biggest foe, it has not gone as far as Netanyahu would like, stopping short of designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a "terrorist" organisation.
Sunak also used the talks to express his concern over Netanyahu's controversial judicial overhaul.
There have been some rocky moments in the past. Britain slapped an arms embargo on Israel following the latter's  .
With the relationship under strain, Israel's then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin approved a weapons deal with Argentina in 1982, which was fighting Britain in the Falklands War.
What to expect of Sunak's visit to Israel?
Sunak's visit has been billed as a diplomatic push to de-escalate the situation.
'The Prime Minister and President Herzog stressed the imperative need to avoid further escalation of violence in the region. They agreed to continue working together to that end,' a statement from the British Prime Minister's office after Sunak met Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
He is widely expected to follow the line taken yesterday by US President Joe Biden, who has thus far taken a leading role in brokering peace in the region between Israel and its neighbours.
London tends to march in lockstep with Washington on foreign and defence policy, particularly when it comes to   in the face of Russia's invasion of its territory.
Landing at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport, Sunak told local reporters: 'Above all, I'm here to express my solidarity with the Israeli people. You have suffered an unspeakable, horrific act of terrorism and I want you to know that the United Kingdom and I stand with you.'
Earlier, he had said the Gaza hospital blast that caused mass Palestinian casualties should be 'a watershed moment for leaders in the region and across the world to come together to avoid further dangerous escalation of conflict.' Britain, he said, would be at 'the forefront of this effort'.
Alongside Sunak's visit, British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, who visited Israel last week, will travel to Egypt, Turkey and Qatar over the next three days to discuss a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

Nablus, occupied West Bank – At three o'clock in the morning, Loay Zaqout found himself staring up at Israeli police surrounding him and two of his colleagues where they were staying in Nazareth.
The police began beating them up, shouting insults before arresting them in the early hours on Monday and taking the three Palestinian workers to the station.
"They treated us horribly because, they said, we were from Gaza," the 31-year-old father said. "The police threatened to return us to Gaza and said that our workers' permits were invalid."

Zaqout, from the central town of Deir al-Balah in the Gaza Strip, has been working in Nazareth for about a year in an auto body shop.
He is one of more than 21,000 Palestinian workers from Gaza who work within Israel in order to support their families – he supports his wife, their three children, and 16 members of his extended family.
On Tuesday, he was among about 100 workers who eventually managed to reach Jenin in the occupied West Bank, battered and frightened and wondering how they would be able to get back to their families.
After being held overnight by officials in Nazareth, away from his two colleagues who were also from Gaza, they were released the next morning with no information.
"I didn't have my phone, any money or my identity card," he said, adding that he managed to hitch a ride about half an hour south, to Jalama, from where he crossed into Jenin.
Zaqout had wanted to return to Gaza on Sunday, "but the war started on Saturday, and now I am on one side and my family is on the other, and I cannot reach them".
He is not alone, all the workers who managed to escape Israel to Jenin were equally worried.
The unprecedented surprise operation launched by the armed wing of Hamas on Israeli military bases and towns meant that their plans to go home were put on hold indefinitely and the siege Israel was laying on Gaza meant they could not reach their families living there because of power blackouts and phone service interruptions.
Israel on Saturday declared itself in a state of war and began relentless bombing of the Gaza Strip, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. According to the health ministry, 1,100 Palestinians have been killed and more than 5,000 others wounded.
Laila Ghannam, governor of Ramallah and al-Bireh, told Al Jazeera that nearly 600 Palestinian workers from Gaza are in the occupied West Bank cities of Ramallah, Hebron, Nablus and Jenin.
"As of yesterday evening, the last batch of workers from the Gaza Strip who work within the Green Line [the boundary of Israel] arrived," she said on Wednesday. "The number of workers has reached 595 workers."
"They've told us that they can't reach some of their friends or relatives, who also work inside, which is worrying," she said.
According to Ghannam, many workers had serious injuries to their faces from being beaten by Israeli security forces.
"Dentists will be made available to the workers to treat them," she said.

Palestinian workers surrounded by 'Jewish extremists'
Unemployment in the Gaza Strip - which has been under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade since 2007 - hovers at 50 percent. Jobs in Israel are in high demand, paying up to 10 times as much as similar jobs in Gaza.
Shaher Saad, the secretary-general of the Federation of Palestinian Trade Unions, said the conditions Palestinian workers suffer inside Israel are extreme.
Dozens of workers have been attacked and, if lucky, expelled to the occupied West Bank.
"Hundreds of workers are contacting us to get them out of the areas they are stuck in. Sometimes we can't do anything because they are surrounded by Jewish extremists and are under siege," he said.
"They're scared because there's a lot of tension, especially after these extremists called for the workers to be taken as hostages."
"We're working around the clock to get these workers out," he added. "I call on the Palestinians living in the areas occupied in 1948 to help these workers and get them to the nearest safe area."

Ammar Abu Yaish, the head of the Jenin Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told Al Jazeera that Israeli forces corralled and dumped 31 workers from Gaza who had been working in the northern city of Safad at the Jalama checkpoint on Tuesday. [Kindly recheck name; seems it's Ammar Abu Bakr? Applies to later mentions]
"The men showed signs of having been assaulted," Abu Yaish said, adding that they were stripped nearly naked.
Palestinian security forces on the other side of the crossing received the workers and provided them with food and shelter.
"They all have permits to work inside Israel," Abu Yaish said, explaining that the workers had a right to be there. "Palestinian trade unions called on workers inside Israel to stay indoors and not go to work."
Osama Sbeih is from Gaza City and has been working in construction in the Rishon area (south of Tel Aviv) for two years.
He says that on Monday, at about midnight, large forces from the Israeli army stormed the dorms where about 37 workers from Gaza lived.
"They began searching, checking our identities, beating us, and insulting us," the 34-year-old said.
"They expelled us towards one of the checkpoints near Ramallah. We did not have a single penny, and we were not allowed to take any of our belongings."
Sbeih, who supports his wife, son, parents and sister, said they slept on the road on the first night before Ramallah officials found them accommodation in a hotel.
"We're so worried about our families, and about our own fates," he said.

Protests in Lebanon express frustration at international support for Israel

Beirut, Lebanon - Hundreds of protesters chanted and waved flags outside the French embassy in Beirut on Tuesday, denouncing Western support for the Israeli military's   of Gaza.
'How are foreign governments with Israel?' said Hassan Badr, 60, who lives in the Palestinian refugee camp   in Beirut. 'They are killing kids in front of the world. They should be supporting the Palestinians, not Israel.'
More than   have been killed in Gaza since  , amid a bombing campaign that United Nations experts said resulted in crimes against humanity .
In the Arab world, news outlets and social media have carried gruesome images of the death and destruction, including photos of dead children. The nongovernmental organisation Save the Children has estimated   since the bombing began.
Tuesday's crowd, significantly smaller than a similar protest on Sunday in Beirut's downtown, included Palestinian and Lebanese demonstrators who expressed frustration over the international community's support for Israel.
'The French people are with the people of Palestine and protesting with us,' said Youssef, a member of the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad who asked to be referred to by his first name only. 'But the French president is 100 percent with Israel.'
Many of the protesters carried flags of Lebanese or Palestinian parties and factions, even if some said they were not aligned with a particular ideology.
'We are here to raise our voices to the rest of the world,' Samar al-Ashi, 36, told Al Jazeera. 'All the people are with us.'

The protest is   to erupt in Lebanon, which has seen demonstrations in most major cities as well as outside the United States and German embassies.
One of the rallying cries is for Israel to announce a ceasefire. But on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected international pressure to suspend hostilities, despite the growing civilian death toll in Gaza.
'This is a time for war,' he said in a televised address.
Meanwhile, in south Lebanon,   along the  , as Israel exchanged fire with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, as well as   based in the area.
 hit a house in the southern village of Alma Shaab on Monday, according to Lebanese daily L'Orient Today. And Hezbollah announced the death of one of its fighters, its 49th casualty since October 7.
Hezbollah leader   is set to give a televised speech on Friday, his first address since hostilities began. On October 25, Hezbollah released a handwritten letter signed by Nasrallah, calling for any members killed in the conflict to be called 'martyrs on the path to Jerusalem'.

Many in Lebanon are hoping the conflict does not expand beyond the southern border region. Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister   told Sky News Arabia on Monday that he was demanding an end to 'Israeli provocations' that might spiral into a  .
'The Lebanese people do not want war,' Mikati said. He did, however, add that he has 'coordinated with international organisations to put in place an [emergency] plan in case war breaks out'.
The last time hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah exploded into a   was in 2006.
One Lebanese minister, speaking anonymously, told Al Jazeera that the 2006 conflict resulted in a grassroots movement to aid those displaced by the fighting. He predicted, however, that no such assistance would be offered this time around.
Lebanon has been in an economic crisis since 2019, he explained, and that means most residents are unable to offer refuge or aid as they had in 2006.
Back at the French embassy, many protesters called for greater international solidarity with the Palestinian cause.
Abu Mohammad, a resident of Beirut, said he came to the embassy to support the Palestinian people and oppose Israel's killing of Gazan children.
'I'm not Palestinian, but I live among them and I know how they feel and what they think,' he said. 'Their future is there [in Gaza]. I hope they can go back to their homes. Many of them still have the keys in their hands.'
The protesters hoped that, by standing outside the French embassy, their voices would reach the country's President Emmanuel Macron.
Last Thursday, France voted in favour of a humanitarian truce at the  , despite voting against a failed Russia-backed ceasefire proposal at the   two weeks ago.
It did, however, vote in favour of Security Council resolutions proposed by the United States and Brazil, calling for a "humanitarian pause". Those resolutions likewise failed to pass.
Macron visited Israel last week and proposed building a coalition to fight Hamas. He has also reiterated his government's call for 'a humanitarian truce to protect the people of Gaza'.
But protesters like Badr, the 60-year-old from the Burj el-Barajneh refugee camp, still hoped Macron might take a stronger stance towards the protection of Palestinian rights.
'I'm with the French [people] and the French resistance,' Badr said, recalling the French underground movement that opposed the Nazis and the Vichy government in World War II. 'And Macron, he should be with us, too!'

Gaza's al-Quds Hospital ceases operations amid Israeli attacks

November 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says the al-Quds Hospital, the second largest in Gaza, has ceased operations due to a fuel shortage as Israeli forces continue to bomb the besieged enclave.
"The hospital has been left to fend for itself under ongoing Israeli bombardment, posing severe risks to the medical staff, patients and displaced civilians," the PRCS said in a statement on Sunday, intensifying fears for the Palestinians seeking treatment and shelter there.
"This cessation of services is due to the depletion of available fuel and power outage. Medical staff are making every effort to provide care to patients and the wounded, even resorting to unconventional medical methods amid dire humanitarian conditions and a shortage of medical supplies, food, and water," PRCS said.
The organisation said it held the international community and signatories of the Fourth Geneva Convention accountable for the complete breakdown of Gaza's healthcare system and the resulting dire humanitarian crisis.
Tommaso Della Longa, spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said al-Quds Hospital has been cut off from the world in the last six to seven days.
"No way in, no way out," said the spokesperson.
Al-Quds Hospital joins   – another major healthcare facility in northern Gaza – and is also now closed to new patients, with staff saying that Israeli bombardment and a lack of fuel and medicine meant those already being treated could die.
Hospitals in the north of the Palestinian enclave are blockaded by Israeli forces and barely able to care for those inside, medical staff said. More people are being killed and wounded daily, but there are fewer and fewer places for the injured to go.
"My son was injured and there was not a single hospital I could take him to so he could get stitches," said Ahmed al-Kahlout, who was fleeing south in accordance with Israeli advice while fearing that nowhere in Gaza was safe.
A plastic surgeon at al-Shifa Hospital said bombing of the building housing incubators had forced them to line up premature babies on ordinary beds, using the little power available to turn the air conditioning to warm.
The Gaza Health Ministry's spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said Israeli fire was "terrorising medical officials and civilians alike".
The Israeli attacks have killed more than 11,000 people in Gaza in five weeks, most of them women and children.

Missile strikes Egypt's Taba resort town near Israel border

At least six people have been wounded after a missile struck the Egyptian resort town of Taba near the Israeli border, according to reports from local media.
The missile on Friday morning hit an ambulance facility and a residential building for the administration of the Taba hospital, Egypt's Al Qahera News said, citing local sources.
A witness in Taba confirmed hearing an explosion and seeing smoke rising, Reuters reported, but the news agency was not immediately able to identify the blast's source.
The incident is believed to be linked to the continuing Israel-Hamas war that has been raging in Gaza since October 7, when Hamas fighters launched an attack on Israel, killing at least 1,405 people.
Israeli air strikes on Gaza have since killed at least 7,028 Palestinians.
Taba is about 220km (135 miles) from the Gaza Strip and straddles Egypt's border with Israel's Red Sea port of Eilat. Israel's military said it was aware of a security incident outside its borders.
Hamas, which governs Gaza, said on Wednesday it had targeted Eilat with a missile, which the Israeli military said hit an outlying area. That incident appeared to be the longest-range Palestinian attack of the Gaza war.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility after Friday morning's blast. Al Qahera reported that an investigation has been launched.
Taba, in Egypt's Sinai peninsula, is popular with tourists. It is about a three-hour drive from Egypt's Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.
The Taba explosion highlights the risks facing Egypt and other countries in the region as fighting intensifies between Israel and Hamas.
Egypt has taken an active role in negotiating access to aid for Palestinians, trying to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas and advocating for a ceasefire. But its proximity to the front line has exposed it to risks.
On October 22, several Egyptian border guards were injured after being accidentally hit by fragments of a shell from an Israeli tank. Israel apologised for the incident.
Other regional countries, including Lebanon and Syria, have also been peripherally caught up in the fighting.
Iran backs both Hamas and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, which Israel has clashed with in skirmishes along the Israel-Lebanon border.
On Thursday, the United States said it had attacked two Iran-linked facilities in  , following a series of attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria.
Last week, the US military said a Navy warship in the northern Red Sea intercepted projectiles launched by Yemen's Houthi armed group potentially towards Israel.

Ben-Gvir says Israeli rights trump Palestinian freedom of movement

Israel's far-right National Security Minister   has openly admitted that his right to move around unimpeded is superior to the freedom of movement for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, sparking outrage.
"My right, the right of my wife and my children to move around Judea and Samaria is more important than freedom of movement for the Arabs," he said in a Wednesday evening interview with Channel 12 News, using the biblical term for the occupied territory.
Directly addressing journalist Mohammad Magadli, who is a Palestinian citizen of Israel, Ben-Gvir said, 'Sorry, Mohammad, but that's the reality.'
Ben-Gvir, known for being a Palestinian-hating religious far-right provocateur, is in control of Israel's Border Police's division in the occupied West Bank. He lives in Kiryat Arba, one of the most radical Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Under international law, settlements in occupied land are considered illegal and a huge obstacle to any notion of a two-state solution.
Ben-Gvir has been convicted several times on charges of supporting a Jewish "terrorist organisation" and of incitement to racism against Arabs and non-Jews. He is also known for his anti-LGBTQ activism.
Some Israeli journalists reacted with outrage on social media over Ben-Gvir's comments, pointing out that he was acknowledging apartheid on air.
Israel's national security minister: 'The right of me, my wife and kids to travel around the West Bank is more important than that of the Arabs. Sorry Mohammed, but that's the reality.'
Anyone who's still not calling this apartheid — what else do they have to say? https://t.co/jClPkURcCZ
- Ben Reiff (@bentreyf) August 23, 2023
Israeli journalist Nir Gontarz  said Ben-Gvir's comments were hardly surprising.
"He simply described reality as it is," Gontarz wrote on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. "This reality was created by leftist and right-wing [Israeli] governments."
Ahmad Tibi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of Knesset, said: "For the first time, an Israeli minister admits on air that Israel enforces an apartheid regime, based on Jewish supremacy.'
Hansen Majadli, a Palestinian editor and columnist at the Israeli daily Haaretz, berated Ben-Gvir's "laziness".
"My problem with this creature is not that he is a racist," she wrote  on X. "After all, I have met racists like him and more throughout my life in the only democracy in the Middle East. My problem with him is that he's just lazy, and lacks style in general."
Congress just had a meltdown about Rep. Jayapal correctly calling Israel a racist state, meanwhile Ben-Gvir and the rest of Israel's fanatical governing coalition is out here literally begging people to understand that Israel is racist. https://t.co/ogEIRZk2ao
- Tariq Kenney-Shawa (@tksshawa) August 23, 2023
MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan blasted the United States for funding and being complicit in Israeli apartheid.
"Meanwhile, US-based defenders of Israel get mad if you say the A-word even though an Israeli minister is openly and proudly admitting to it," he said.
The US gives Israel – the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign aid – an average of $3.8bn in military aid annually.
We in the Unites States fund this apartheid and are complicit in this apartheid.
Meanwhile, US-based defenders of Israel get mad if you say the A-word even though an Israeli minister is openly and proudly admitting to it.
- Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) August 23, 2023
In 2021, several leading international, Israeli and Palestinian   published detailed reports describing Israel as an apartheid state and holding it accountable for treating Palestinians as an "inferior racial group".
The US and the European Union have defended Israel, with the former   proclaiming Israel is 'not a racist or apartheid state'.
Apartheid!?… How dare you? #Israel 's Security Minister is screaming his lungs out that Jewish Israelis have a superior status to Palestinians.
At this stage, Ben Gvir can just put us on trucks & deport us to Jordan while the civilized world looks the other way!  pic.twitter.com/PiTyqwaV76

Fear, confusion as Israel issues evacuation order for northern Gaza

Israel's order for   to relocate from the north to the south within 24 hours has created an atmosphere of confusion and fear in besieged enclave on the seventh day of Israel's retaliatory  .
The directive came on Friday as Israel is expected to order a ground invasion of the densely populated territory following last week's unprecedented attack carried out on southern Israel by Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza.
In response, the Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs told residents in the north to 'remain steadfast in your homes and to stand firm in the face of this disgusting psychological war waged by the occupation'.
Residents of northern Gaza say the streets were empty as people stayed inside their homes trying to decide what to do next following Israel's evacuation orders, AP reported.
There were no cars on the road except for ambulances. Because of the internet outages and collapse of phone networks, Palestinians said information was scant and most still had not heard direct orders from the army to evacuate.
"Until now, people believe this is a kind of psychological war, they don't want to believe it," Al Jazeera's Safwat al-Kahlout, reporting from northern Gaza, said in the early hours of Friday.
"Many are asking, is this true, is it a nightmare, or what?"
Al-Kahlout said there were no preparations in place for such a mass movement in a territory already devastated by 16 years of a crippling blockade.
'In practical terms, 1.1 million people – they don't have enough facilities to move, how can they move? Donkeys? They don't have enough donkeys. Cars? There are not enough cars. There is no fuel for vehicles to move for seven days now," al-Kahlout said, adding that the situation reminded people of the 1948 catastrophe  – the mass exodus of at least 750,000 Arabs from Palestine.
'Until last night people were looking for water to drink, now they are looking for how to leave and where to go," al-Kahlout said.
'More than one million Palestinians are panicking, are confused, and they don't have a plan, and they don't understand what to do. Now my children are asking me, 'Where should we go?' I said, I don't know.'
'Chaos'
Inas Hamdan, an officer at the UN Palestinian refugee agency in Gaza City, described the situation to the AP news agency as "chaos".
"No one understands what to do," said Hamdan, who grabbed whatever she could to throw into her bags amid the panic and shouting.
'Forget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel, the only concern now is just if you'll make it, if you're going to live,' Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City said, breaking into heaving sobs.
She also said there was no way that 1.1 million people could be safely evacuated.
Farsakh said there are hospital patients who cannot be moved under current conditions and many of the medics were refusing to leave and abandon their patients.
Instead, she said, they called their colleagues to say goodbye.
Imad Abu Alaa, the UN Palestinian refugee agency officer in charge of shelters in northern Gaza, said there were simply too many people to evacuate at such short notice.
'What about UN shelters? We're talking about civilians. Suddenly that doesn't even matter?' he told AP.
Ian Parmeter, former Australian ambassador to Lebanon, told Al Jazeera that Israel "is under no illusions" that 1 million people can simply move within 24 hours.
'It's simply warning that they're coming in.'
In its statement to civilians in Gaza, the Israeli military said the evacuation was for their own "safety" as it that it planned to "operate significantly in Gaza City" in the coming days.
'You will be able to return to Gaza City only when another announcement permitting it is made. Do not approach the area of the security fence with the State of Israel,' it added in a statement.
But thehead of Hamas's political and international relations bureau, Basem Naim, told Al Jazeera that Palestinians had "two options: To defeat this occupation or to die in our homes."
He added: 'We are not going to leave. We are not ready to repeat the Nakba again."

Once pro-Palestinian, Greece is now one of Israel's closest European allies

October 31st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Athens, Greece – Greece has emerged as a key supporter of Israel in the Eastern Mediterranean, a position unimaginable little more than a decade ago and apparently at odds with public opinion.
'I come here not just as an ally but as a true friend,' Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Tel Aviv on October 23, as the   Middle East conflict flared.
'Greece, from the very first moment, supported the right of Israel to defend itself in line with international law,' he said.
Unlike some other European leaders who demonstrated similar solidarity, Mitsotakis did not also pay a courtesy visit to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the Fatah Palestinian movement.
That may rankle with the two-thirds of Greeks, who support neutrality in the current war.
While just 18.4 percent are in favour of a pro-Israel position, 11.5 percent want Greece to be openly pro-Palestinian, according to an opinion poll aired by Star Channel two days after Mitsotakis's visit.
Despite championing humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza, Greece was one of 45 abstentions from a UN General Assembly   calling for an immediate humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas, on October 27. A majority of 120 countries voted in favour.
'Eight EU members voted for the UN call for a humanitarian ceasefire. Greece, under Mitsotakis, chose not to be among them,' European Parliament member for the opposition Syriza party, Dimitris Papadimoulis, told Al Jazeera.

Anyone who 'wants humanity and peace to prevail' would follow a 'more balanced position that also maintains good relations with the Arab world – a position that is conducive to a solution for the Palestinians,' Papadimoulis said.
Greece did, however, join a European Council call for 'safe and unhindered humanitarian access' in Gaza on October 27, 'including humanitarian pauses and corridors".
But Greece has gone beyond statements in helping Israel.
According to Greek media, large numbers of United States C-17 and C-130 transport aircraft have been stationed at the US air and naval base at Souda Bay, in Crete, and the Greek air force base at Elefsina, near Athens, in case a mass evacuation of US citizens from Israel should be necessary.
An historic change
Greece's official foreign policy position, now backed by right- and left-wing parties when in power, is starkly different to its traditionally pro-Palestinian policy during the Cold War, when Greece and Israel still had not developed full diplomatic relations.
When Netanyahu's predecessor, Menachem Begin, invaded Lebanon to destroy the military wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1982, Greek ships spirited the organisation's leader, Yasser Arafat, to safety in Athens.
Back then, expatriate Palestinians frequently held demonstrations on the streets of Athens with Greek left-wing party support, to trumpet their cause on European soil.

The support for Palestinians was not merely sentimental.
Greek-owned tankers carry a third of the world's crude oil, and that trade dictated good relations with the Arab world for decades.
Another reason was Turkey's invasion of Cyprus in 1974.
'Greece was very interested in getting UN votes in favour of its position on the Cyprus issue,' Aristotle Tziampiris, professor of international relations at the University of Piraeus told Al Jazeera. 'You had to weigh one Israeli vote versus 20 or so Arab votes.'
The beginnings of rapprochement occurred in 1990, when Mitsotakis's father, former prime minister Konstantine Mitsotakis, fully and legally recognised Israel, which he considered necessary 'for the restoration and establishment of peace in the region'.
However, Israel's close relationship with Turkey in the 1990s was a problem for Greece.
Then-Palestinian President Yasser Arafat (C) walks hand in hand with Christodoulos (L), the Greek archbishop of Athens and head of the Church of Greece, and Mufti Ikrema Sabri, the then-Muslim leader in Jerusalem, prior to their meeting in Bethlehem on August 25, 2000 [File: Reuters]
'The Turkish criterion, a permanent fixture in the Greek foreign ministry, dictates that we can't have good relations with Israel if it is also developing its relations with Turkey,' a senior Greek government official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.
'We put this dilemma to them and the Israelis in those days had much more strategic interests in Turkey, so we forced them to pick Turkey.'
In 2010, another clash between the Israeli army and Hamas changed everything.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sent a flotilla with humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians' aid. Israeli commandos attacked the flotilla, suspecting it of carrying weapons, killing nine people.
The breakdown in Turkish-Israeli relations was a void Greece's political establishment moved to fill 'with astonishing speed', said Tziampiris.
'Israel has been looking at Greece all these years as a gateway to the European Union that could facilitate Israel's relationship with the EU and soften its isolation due to Israel's behaviour towards the Palestinians,' said the government official.
Greece's budding friendship with Israel 'is not personal or partisan, but represents a national strategy that is going on for close to 15 years', said Tziampiris.
In a country whose politicians are given to infighting and frequently placing party interests above national interests, that, he said, is 'something to be admired'.
Greece had its own reasons to embrace Israel.
It had essentially gone bankrupt that year, and needed a bailout from its eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund in Washington. By signalling support for Israel, it drew closer to the US.
Greece was also becoming part of a budding energy partnership. 2010 was the year in which Israel discovered Leviathan, holding an estimated 566 billion cubic metres of gas and turning Israel overnight into the Eastern Mediterranean's biggest owner of exportable gas.
The following year, Greece and Israel started discussing building EastMed - a 1,900km-long (1,180-mile), $7bn mostly undersea pipeline to carry 10-20 billion cubic metres of Israeli gas to Europe via Greece each year.
Greek hydrocarbon companies have formed a consortium to build that pipeline, and one Athens-based company already plays a strategic role in the Israeli economy. Partly through Israeli financing, Energean now operates a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) platform anchored offshore Israel, which extracts and liquefies Israeli offshore gas for export.
Defence relationship
When in 2020 Greek-Turkish relations became tense, Greece sought a relationship with Israel's sophisticated defence industry.
Greece signed its first military agreement with Israel on May 6 2020, leasing two Heron UAVs to monitor the Aegean. Greece had been caught unawares by Turkey's development of its Bayraktar drones and needed the Herons as an interim solution before developing its own UAVs - something the Hellenic Aerospace Industry is now doing in collaboration with Greek universities.
In 2022, Greece would also buy the Drone Dome anti-drone defence system from Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, and in 2023 it would buy dozens of Orbiter 3 surveillance and reconnaissance drones, also from Rafael.
Mitsotakis signed cybersecurity cooperation protocols with Netanyahu in June 2020, and invited Israeli investors to use Greece as a base from which to reach the EU single market, especially in IT.
Unlike in 2010, when Greece's economy was teetering, the invitation now had takers.
In February 2021, Israeli defence manufacturers SK Group and Plasan took control of the defunct Hellenic Vehicles Industry (ELVO).
In 2022, Greece and Israel's Elbit launched a joint flight training centre in the southern Greek town of Kalamata. Israel had once sought training airspace from Turkey. Now it had the use of Athens' vast flight information region.
In 2023, Greece bought 34 Spike NLOS short-range missile defence systems with about 500 missiles from Israel's Elbit to protect its east Aegean islands.
Turkey has moved in the opposite direction during this time, offering Hamas leaders passports and offices on Turkish soil.
Erdogan recently frustrated Washington when he said Hamas was not a "terrorist" organisation and called Israel an occupier.
That places Greece and Turkey on opposite sides during the conflict in Gaza.
'Hosting Hamas was always an issue between Israel and Turkey and when we talked about rapprochement it was an issue that was on the table, and it's still on the table,' Israeli ambassador Noam Katz told Greece's Open TV.

Is Turkey uniquely positioned to mediate between Palestinians and Israel?

October 22nd, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Istanbul, Turkey – The war on Gaza has seen Turkey step forward as a potential mediator to not only end Israel's bombardment of the Palestinian enclave, but also bring lasting peace to one of the world's most intractable conflicts.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led his country's bid, keen to promote Turkey as a global player and replicate Ankara's success in   between Ukraine and its invader, Russia, to strike a deal for Kyiv to export grain.
Hamas's   attack on Israel and Israel's retaliatory air raids on Gaza – which have yet to end – came as Ankara and Tel Aviv were fostering   after more than a decade of hostility.
Ties to both sides
Turkey has relations with  , making it one of the few countries with any influence with the group that has ruled Gaza since 2007.
Ankara did not declare Hamas a 'terrorist organisation', leading Tel Aviv to protest that Turkey-based Hamas members have been involved in planning attacks on Israel.
'Turkey has a good communication channel with Hamas, which is an important asset,' Taha Ozhan, research director at the Ankara Institute, said. 'It has been built up over 17 years, when Turkey was the only country to   Hamas into [its capital].
'In these times of crisis, the communication channels and relations are important,' said Ozhan, a former chair of the Turkish parliament's foreign affairs committee.
Turkish officials - led by Erdogan and his foreign minister, Hakan Fidan - have acted on this advantage, seeing a central role for Ankara in resolving the latest   conflict.
Their immediate focus has been on getting   to civilians in Gaza and seeking the release of some 200 hostages taken by Hamas.
Speaking in Beirut on Tuesday, Fidan said 'a variety of countries' had asked Turkey for help in releasing their citizens.
'We have started discussing with the political section of Hamas,' he said. 'We've been putting a lot of effort to make sure that children and foreigners especially are released.'
Support for Palestine
There is wide   in Turkey for the Palestinian cause, with pro-Palestine demonstrations drawing thousands of Turks in recent days.
At the same time, Turkey had relations with Israel for much of Israel's history, until things hit a rough patch in 2010.
That year, Israel killed nine Turks who were on board a Freedom Flotilla trying to deliver humanitarian aid to a besieged Gaza Strip, with a tenth dying after years in a coma. Relations were restored in 2016, only to fall apart again in 2018.
That year, Israel passed a law declaring itself the 'nation-state of the Jewish people', drawing criticism from Erdogan. Then the United States   in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and Israel killed tens of protesters participating in the   in Gaza.
This has resulted in Erdogan being held in high regard by Palestinians.
'Erdogan remains lionised in Gaza, the West Bank, and across much of the Arab world, due to his history of using harsh rhetoric to attack Israel's policies towards the Palestinians,' said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at political risk advisory group Teneo.
This lionisation survived when Turkey changed gears last year and started a regional rapprochement drive that saw it rebuilding bridges with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE – and Israel.
'New methodologies'
Fidan has been meeting leaders across the region, and held phone calls with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh.
Ankara, he said, is seeking to 'open the door for a permanent and comprehensive peace' based on a two-state solution, and suggested Turkey could act as a guarantor.
'We don't believe there will be a permanent solution by using the old methodologies, so hopefully in the upcoming meetings we will continue to express our ideas on the use of new methodologies,' he said in a joint news conference with his Lebanese counterpart on Tuesday.
Ozhan says Turkey may be best placed to put forward a political framework that enables discussions on the future of Palestinians. 'Unless we ask that question, everything will be temporary or even arbitrary,' he said.
Ferhat Pirincci, international relations professor at Turkey's Bursa Uludag University, said: 'What Turkey has advocated from the very beginning is that many problems, especially frozen conflicts, can be resolved peacefully and therefore a sustainable peace can be established.'
But Turkey's efforts at a lasting solution could be thwarted without meaningful engagement from both sides.
'Without talking about occupation, without talking about Palestine and Palestinians' situation, there's no room to move, it's just talk,' Ozhan said.
'It depends on if Israel – and the support it has coming from Washington and Europe – are really interested in mediation.'
Warning of a 'ripple effect' that could expand the conflict, he added: 'The wise choice should be re-establishing a political context and using this crisis as a leverage to create a political framework. But it depends on Israel and it depends on some Western capitals.'

'Two sides of the same coin': Activists decry Assad's criticism of Israel

November 12th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
On Saturday, Bashar al-Assad, the head of the Syrian regime, gave a speech at the Arab-Islamic summit in Saudi Arabia. His call for an end to the war on Gaza sparked anger among activists in northwest Syria, who saw the denunciation of Israel as hypocritical.
Al-Assad criticised the "vicious circle" of allowing Israel to commit massacres then being content with providing humanitarian aid instead of protection for the Palestinian people.
"A right cannot be restored when the criminal has become a judge and the thief has become a referee," he said, referring to the role of Western countries in the Israeli bombing campaign of Gaza.
Since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict on October 7, Syrian activists have used the phrase 'two sides of the same coin' to describe both the Syrian regime and Israel's crimes against the Syrian and Palestinian peoples. They consider al-Assad's accusations of crimes and impunity to also describe what he has done in Syria over the past 12 years.

Bombing under the radar
Munira Baloch, a 34-year-old journalist, said she believes that Assad was able to remain at the head of his regime despite his crimes because he obtained the 'green light' to do what he wanted against the Syrian people.
She told Al Jazeera that the regime's pattern of using flimsy pretexts to justify bombing and crimes, which the world condones, continues to this day.
During October, Gaza wasn't the only area being bombed. Rather, Idlib witnessed the  . Hundreds of sites, including civilian ones, were targeted by aerial and artillery attacks, leaving dozens of people killed and wounded, and causing a new wave of displacement.
'The policy is the same in both countries of using intense bombing to displace opponents,' said Baloch. She lived in Rankous in the Damascus countryside before being forced into repeated displacement then settling in Idlib six years ago. "We [Gaza and northwestern Syria] are both densely populated areas under siege and continuous bombing."
Baloch still remembers the months she endured a siege by regime forces while living with six families in a two-room house with no electricity, water, or heating: "We ran out of bread crumbs until we accepted the displacement agreement to Idlib,' she said.
Political hypocrisy
During the past few weeks, there have been many scenes of Palestinians being displaced, on foot, from northern Gaza to the south.
That brought back painful memories for Ali al-Dalati, who was displaced with his family, in search of safety, about six years ago. In January 2017, the 26-year-old activist and his family walked eight kilometres (five miles) from the village of Bassemah – which was being bombed by regime forces with chemical weapons, incendiary phosphorus, and napalm – to the village of Deir Kanon in the Damascus countryside.

'I can't forget,' he told Al Jazeera, about the scene of people gathering together to reach the safe zone, which "seemed like the Day of Judgment".
During their displacement, those alongside him were targeted by snipers, similar to the Palestinians being targeted by Israel. Al-Dalati recalled that whoever was walking towards the safe zone could not approach any of the dead on the road. 'My neighbour who came with us was killed, and then her son was killed because he tried to drag her body to bury it,' he said.
Al-Dalati, who arrived in Idlib on January 31, 2017, viewed the invitations of al-Assad, who he described as a 'war criminal,' and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, whose forces occupy four Arab countries (Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen), to the summit as hypocritical and demonstrating an absence of actual intention to provide assistance to Palestinians.
Al-Dalati said he believes the current 'popularity' of the Palestinian cause and the rising number of deaths is what fuels international interest, adding that condemning one crime and not the other is not acceptable.
Same killers
Talal al-Loush, a 61-year-old activist who was displaced from Homs to Idlib nine years ago, told Al Jazeera that he could not listen to Bashar al-Assad's entire speech because he felt 'nauseous'. He was astonished that the man responsible for the killing and arresting of hundreds of thousands and the displacement of millions would speak on behalf of Gaza.
'The killers are the same, but the one that pulls the trigger is different,' al-Loush said, recalling the crimes he witnessed in Homs between 2012 and 2013, when regime forces and allied Iranian and Shiite militias committed horrific massacres and forced civilians into displacement, similar to Israel's actions in Gaza.

Al-Loush believes that Israel's military superiority has enabled it to commit crimes within a shorter period than what was required by the Syrian regime. "The videos that show the extent of destruction and killing in Gaza are the same scenes we saw in Homs 10 years ago," he said.
Torture in the name of Palestine
The crimes of the Syrian regime affected Palestinians and Syrians alike, according to Muhammad Taha, a 25-year-old Palestinian who lived through the two-year siege in the Yarmouk Camp neighbourhood, south of Damascus. There, dozens died of hunger.
Taha, who was born in Damascus and now lives in Idlib after being displaced, believes that the Syrian regime and the leaders of the countries surrounding Palestine are mere shields for Israel. He said he was not surprised by the similarities of the crimes committed against civilians by the Syrian regime and Israel's attacks on Gaza, such as the bombing of civilians, hospitals, mosques, churches, civil defence teams, and ambulances.
Standing with the Palestinians is a false claim by the Syrian regime, Taha said. He points to the "Palestine Branch", the notorious military intelligence division in Damascus known for its brutal torture of detainees, as evidence. 'No Palestinian family in Syria was spared" having at least one of its members being detained at the facility, he said.

Germany's immigration authorities accused of 'anti-Palestinian repression'

August 31st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
The twin Palestinian brothers thought they were ordinary young students in Germany.
They attended student events for Palestinians who wanted to study medicine in Germany, enjoying sitting around the campfire with new friends.
One occasionally went to a local mosque, helping to wash plates at the end of Ramadan, but spent more time volunteering at a church helping refugees.
They timed their holidays to coincide with a Palestinian conference run by a United Nations-consulting NGO, staying with family and friends and using this as an excuse to see different cities in Europe, like Milan and Copenhagen, barely attending the conference.
Over the best part of their decade in the European country, A and O, 28, who did not wish their full names to be given out of fear of legal consequences, felt integrated and were doing well in their studies and at work while learning to master the tricky German language, but something was not quite right.
O, then a pharmacy student, received a puzzling letter in 2017. He was no longer allowed to work, leaving him in legal limbo. He did not hear anything else for years, until he took the initiative to phone up the interior ministry in his home state of Hessen.
'Security concerns'
The civil servant sounded confused, but this set things in motion. A few years later, both brothers were separately invited to speak with immigration authorities about 'security concerns'.
They were subjected to long security interviews that they called 'an interrogation', over half of which was spent discussing their opinions on the Middle East conflict.
They explained the Palestinian perspective patiently to the authorities. The brothers have mainstream, liberal Palestinian views, wanting a peaceful democratic coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis and rejecting violence.
They criticised the Hamas movement to their interviewers and even recognised Israel's 'right to exist', a controversial framing that many Palestinians reject, as it is often used to argue that there must be a Jewish majority in the state and therefore, Palestinians under Israeli rule should not have equal rights.
The brothers received similar letters in May from the immigration authorities rejecting the extension of their visas and initiating deportation procedures.
A lost his job as a result. The letters sent to them do not match his recollections of the interview.
'They confiscated my opinion and projected their own imaginations onto it. They selected anything and cut it so that it fit their prejudices, not to my statements or opinions,' he said.
Among the justifications given for deportation was attendance at Palestinian community events such as PalMed Students, the student event where they were taught how to use medical equipment, and briefly attending the conferences for the Palestinian Return Center, as well as pro-Palestinian Facebook comments.

The two Palestinian nationals 'having pro-Palestinian sympathies' and a 'one-sided, Palestinian perspective' were mentioned in context as security risks.
O's "delayed" recognition of Israel's "right to exist" was given as evidence of this, as well as his claim that many Palestinian attacks against Israel were reactions to Israeli actions.
'It's about intimidating Palestinians. The background for all of these things is the idea from the security services, that if we follow Palestinians' Facebook activities, they'll be intimidated,' says O.
Misrepresented
The documents received by the brothers, which have been seen by Al Jazeera, are contradictory. One was told that being a long-term member of the humanitarian organisation PalMed was evidence of being against the liberal democratic order and showed sympathy for Hamas.
The other was told that the membership of PalMed Germany could not be used as evidence for support for Hamas, because the group is concerned with humanitarian medical support in the Gaza Strip.
'Membership alone in PalMed does not necessarily prove a membership of Hamas or supporting its terrorist activities,' said the letter to A.
The documents also misrepresent typical Palestinian expressions to make them sound politically extreme.
It is common for Palestinians to call all of those who die in the conflict, including civilians, 'martyrs'. The document implies that because one of the brothers used the word on Facebook, they support violent attacks on Israel, despite his assurances to the contrary.
Attending a mosque once every few months was considered 'against the fundamental democratic order' because of alleged connections to the Muslim Brotherhood, which there is no evidence A knew about.
Though the authorities admitted the brothers show no evidence of Islamist beliefs, confusingly they used A's statement that he disagreed with the Muslim Brotherhood as evidence that he knew about a connection between his local mosque and the Muslim Brotherhood.
Another Palestinian, who also wanted to remain anonymous, was asked about their opinions on the Middle East conflict in a citizenship application: "Due to the fact that the Palestinian and Israeli peoples do not [have] a peaceful co-existence, with regard to Israel's special relationship with Germany, I would like to ask you where you stand on this. Please give a short written statement."
They are still waiting for the decision.
'Unfounded allegations'
Criminologist Christine Graebsch, a law professor at the University of Applied Sciences Dortmund, sees the accusations against the brothers as legally unconvincing.
She told Al Jazeera that 'distant connections to Palestinian organisations are mentioned as alleged proof of clandestine support for Hamas … but these connections are not proven, only stated', while 'wordings or symbols in Facebook posts that represent a rather general Palestinian view' are 'framed as radical within the German context'.
'From my experience, courts will later override these unfounded allegations of the security and migration agencies,' Graebsch said.
However, she added, 'this takes years of thorough legal work and obtaining expert witness independent of the security authorities' aspersions' and can cause the brothers major difficulties such as deportation, prohibitions to work and strict infringements on civil liberties.
As a lawyer, she has handled similar cases herself and sees a 'system' in place where different migration authorities use similar arguments to make migration and integration more difficult for Palestinians.
"It's very unusual what's happening. I find it interesting that they were asked to give their recognition to the state of Israel, not just 'pro-Palestinian views' – this has nothing to do with dangerousness and also goes far beyond the expectation to accept the German constitution – which is what the law is about," Graebsch said.
The European Legal Support Center, an advocacy group for the Palestinian cause in Europe, said: 'We see here how deportation decisions are manifested on entirely racist and absurd premises. In our preliminary assessment, these cases present further proof of how law is abused and circumvented, as needed, to enact this anti-Palestinian repression by state authorities.'
They point out that these two cases are just the tip of the iceberg.
'As legal experts providing legal support to advocates for Palestine in Europe, we have dealt with dozens of cases of unfounded accusations and restrictions of individuals' fundamental rights, only on the account of being Palestinian or supporting their struggle for justice,' the group said.
Palestinian activist and filmmaker Rashad Alhindi argued that the German state was seeking to ban pro-Palestinian activism from the public sphere, pointing to   on demonstrations in Berlin.
'Just being Palestinian appears to be a problem in Germany for particular authorities."
A representative of the Hessian government said: 'We do not make any political statements or assessments to press organs.'

Israel kills Palestinian, destroys even more of Nur Shams camp

Tulkarem, occupied West Bank – Israeli forces have killed a young Palestinian man and seriously injured another during a large raid on a refugee camp in the northern occupied West Bank city of Tulkarem, damaging infrastructure in the camp.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health announced 21-year-old Ayed Samih Khaled Abu Harb dead at 8:15am (06:15 GMT) on Tuesday, noting he was shot in the head. A funeral procession was held for him at 11am.
Israeli forces, with armoured tractors, stormed the overcrowded Nur Shams refugee camp from several fronts at dawn, inciting armed resistance from Palestinian fighters.
They bulldozed the road leading to the camp, which is minutes from Tulkarem city, and destroyed a number of homes and shops, as well as infrastructure, before withdrawing three hours later.
'They destroyed everything'
Taha al-Irani, head of the camp's popular committee, spoke to Al Jazeera from the camp on Tuesday about the level of destruction and the shock of Abu Harb being killed and another man injured.

"I want to assure you that the martyr [Ayed], was just standing at his front door when he was killed, and the man in critical condition is a taxi driver who was headed to work," al-Irani, 50, said.
"It's total destruction in the camp … The main road tying the camp to other cities – to Tulkarem, Nablus, Ramallah – was partially destroyed."
Nur Shams refugee camp, established in 1952, is one of the two camps in Tulkarem and was built to house Palestinian refugees from the Haifa area following the 1948 Nakba, or ethnic cleansing of Palestine by Zionist militias.
Mohammad Abu Talal, a 39-year-old supermarket owner, told Al Jazeera: "The army entered with bulldozers and tractors. They destroyed the shop, they destroyed everything."
​​​​​​​In a statement, the Tulkarem Directorate of Education announced that schools would be suspended on Tuesday.
232 Palestinians killed this year
With the death of Abu Harb, the number of Palestinians killed by the Israeli army since the beginning of this year has risen to 232.
The Israeli army said it arrested 21 Palestinian "wanted suspects" overnight on Tuesday alone. The total number of Palestinians held in various forms of Israeli detention is in the thousands.

The Israeli army has been militarily occupying the West Bank, where some three million Palestinians live, for 56 years.
Over the past two years, Palestinian armed resistance has reorganised and risen in prominence, particularly in the north of the occupied West Bank. In response, Israel has been attempting to crush this resistance through near-daily raids on Palestinian cities, villages and refugee camps that almost always result in casualties.
Nur Shams was targeted in another recent large-scale Israeli raid on July 24, during which at least 13 Palestinians were injured, including four with live ammunition and nine by shrapnel. Israeli forces also damaged infrastructure badly during that raid, forcing the Palestinian Authority to dedicate a portion of its budget tothe camp's reconstruction.
"Thank God that we haven't put out tenders for reconstruction of roads and infrastructure [after the earlier raids] yet," said al-Irani.
On August 5, the Israeli army raided the camp and shot 18-year-old Mahmoud Abu Sa'an in the head at point-blank range, killing him, the  . Abu Sa'an had just graduated from high school.
"If the Israeli thinks that he can achieve security and peace through his oppression and these crimes that he carries out, he is delusional. This would not come unless Palestinians are given their rights, to live in dignity in their state," said al-Irani.

An Israeli air raid has killed Palestinian journalist Mohammad Abu Hasira along with 42 family members near Gaza City, according to local media reports.
The Israeli bombing "targeted his house' overnight between Sunday and Monday, the Wafa news agency reported on Tuesday.
The press service of Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, said Abu Hasira's body was recovered under the debris.
He is one of at least 37 journalists killed in Israeli attacks since October 7, according to figures released by the press freedoms group Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) on Monday.
Thirty-two of the journalists CPJ tracked were Palestinian, four were Israelis, and one was Lebanese.
On October 25, an Israeli attack killed the family of Al Jazeera bureau chief  , including his wife, son, daughter, grandson, and at least eight other relatives.
Israel has waged a devastating bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip since October 7 following a Hamas attack on Israeli territory that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, Israeli authorities say.
Israel's attacks have since killed more than 10,000 Palestinians, a third of them children, Gaza officials say, and displaced 1.5 million people.
The United Nations' rights chief, Volker Turk, said on Tuesday it has been 'one full month of carnage, of incessant suffering, bloodshed, destruction, outrage and despair'.

Some have also reported being arrested, stripped down, and beaten by Israeli soldiers in what was supposed to be a "safe corridor" to flee south, OCHA reported.
An up-to-date death toll for Gaza could not be made available for the fifth day in a row owing to the collapse of communication and medical services, according to OCHA.
At least six Palestinians have been arrested in overnight Israeli raids across the occupied West Bank, according to Wafa.
Situation at Gaza's hospitals
Israeli forces renewed their attack on al-Shifa early on Thursday, with tanks and bulldozers advancing into the hospital and damaging its walls, according to Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum.

Israel has revised downwards the death toll from an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas on  , to approximately 1,200 people against a previous government estimate of 1,400.
"Around 1,200 is the official number of victims of the October 7 massacre," spokesperson Lior Haiat of Israel's Foreign Ministry said on Friday in a written statement, according to the Reuters news agency.
The figure had been updated on Thursday, he said.
According to Haiat, the number was revised since unidentified corpses previously included in the tally likely belong to Palestinian fighters, the AFP news agency said.
"This is the updated number," Haiat told AFP. "It is due to the fact that there were a lot of corpses that were not identified and now we think those belong to terrorists … not Israeli casualties."
In a statement criticising a UNESCO resolution on Friday, Haiat posted on X that Hamas had killed "about 1,200 people" in the attack.
Israel rejects with disgust the one-sided resolution taken by UNESCO today regarding the situation in Gaza.
The resolution totally ignores the October 7 massacre by Hamas terrorists, who brutally murdered about 1200 people in cold blood, and kidnapped 240 including babies, pic.twitter.com/nklsjK5IFp
- Lior Haiat (@LiorHaiat) November 10, 2023
The updated figure comes more than one month after Palestinian gunmen carried out an attack on towns,  , and military bases in southern Israel. It included the killing of Israeli civilians, including women and children, in residential areas and at a  .
Israeli authorities also say that Palestinian groups also took more than 240 people captive  , including Israeli soldiers and civilians as well as people from numerous foreign countries.
Israel has responded by   access to food, electricity, and fuel for the more than 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip and has pounded the area with a relentless bombing campaign.
Non-stop Israeli air raids have levelled entire neighbourhoods,   more than 70 percent of Gaza's inhabitants, and killed 11,078 people, according to Palestinian authorities.
The United Nations has said that Israel's attacks on Gaza amount to   of a population with few options for seeking safe haven, and humanitarian conditions in the strip have grown increasingly dire.

Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled northern Gaza on foot as Israeli forces push deeper into dense urban neighbourhoods and   where residents have been sheltering.
Gaza City has been the focus of Israel's ground offensive, with fierce battles and air raids reported on Friday in densely populated areas.
A spokesperson for the Israeli army said on Friday more than 100,000 Palestinians have moved from the north to the south of Gaza in the last two days.
A never-ending stream of people including many children, the wounded, and the elderly were seen moving south, mostly on foot, carrying only small backpacks and essential belongings.

Israel has repeatedly targeted and attacked civilians who are making their way to the south.
'The fighting in the urban areas of the Gaza Strip has reached  , as the Israeli occupation forces are pushing forward and deeper,' Al Jazeera's Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Khan Younis.
'Now the Israeli troops are stationed in Tel Al-Hawa neighbourhood, in Al-Shati refugee camp and even in the eastern areas of Gaza as they are trying to infiltrate more into the central and to main centres of Gaza City. They are only one kilometre [0.6 miles] away from  .'

The UN's humanitarian office said on Friday it is unable to   trucks to the north of Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people still reside.
"If there is a hell on earth, it is the north of Gaza," Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told reporters in Geneva.
Also on Friday, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk, called for an investigation into what he called Israel's use of "high-impact explosive  " in Gaza. He said the use of such weapons was causing indiscriminate destruction in the besieged Palestinian enclave.

The UN said earlier this week that at least 1.5 million of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have fled their homes since the war began.
More than 11,000 Palestinians, including 4,506 children, have been killed in Gaza since Israel started pounding the enclave in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack that Israel says left more than 1,400 dead, mostly civilians.

Israeli Prime Minister   has hailed recent so-called "normalisation" deals between Israel and Arab states, stressing that Palestinians must not have "veto" over such agreements.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly on Friday morning, Netanyahu lauded the prospect of formal relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, underscoring the   in efforts to broker a pact between the two countries.
The Israeli prime minister also condemned the Iranian government and called on the international community to take a more stern position against Tehran.
Here, Al Jazeera looks at five key takeaways from Netanyahu's address:
Says Palestinians must not have veto over 'normalisation'
Netanyahu outlined what he called his vision for "peace" in the Middle East, in which Arab states would embrace Israel regardless of  .
"I've long sought to make peace with the Palestinians. But I also believe that we must not give the Palestinians a veto over new peace treaties with Arab states," he said.
"The Palestinians could greatly benefit from a broader peace. They should be part of that process, but they should not have a veto over the process."
Few Arab states have recognised Israel since its establishment in 1948, but former US President Donald Trump's administration helped secure agreements to establish relations between Israel and the   and Morocco in 2020.
Sudan also agreed to join the normalisation deals, formally known as the Abraham Accords.
Previously, much of the region had conditioned recognition of Israel on establishing a viable Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, as articulated in the  .
That plan also calls for finding a just solution to the plight of Palestinian refugees.
Holds Middle East maps without Palestine
Despite his claims of pushing for peace with Palestinians, Netanyahu held up two maps of the Middle East with Israel highlighted in blue.
Both maps showed the occupied Palestinian territories – the West Bank and Gaza – as well as Syria's occupied Golan Heights as being part of Israel.
The Israeli prime minister, who has a history of using props and   at the UNGA, employed the maps to emphasise Israel's growing relations with neighbouring Arab countries.
Netanyahu is presiding over one of the most right-wing governments in the history of Israel, which has been intensifying violence and   against Palestinians while expanding illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.
But on Friday, Netanyahu portrayed Israel as a peace-seeking nation, saying that "Palestinians must stop spewing Jew-hatred and finally reconcile themselves to the Jewish state."
Lauds potential deal with Saudi Arabia
Most of the Israeli prime minister's speech revolved around Israeli-Arab rapprochement, including a potential normalisation deal with Saudi Arabia.
Unofficial ties between Israel and the Gulf kingdom have been growing for years, but the Israeli prime minister argued on Friday that a formal diplomatic agreement would be transformative for the region.
"Peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia will truly create a new Middle East," Netanyahu said.
"Such a peace will go a long way to ending the Arab-Israeli conflict. It will encourage other Arab states to normalise their relations with Israel," he continued.
"It will enhance the prospects of peace with the Palestinians. It will encourage a broader reconciliation between Judaism and Islam, between Jerusalem and Mecca."
When asked about the prospects of normalising ties to Israel, Saudi Arabia had previously said it was sticking by the Arab Peace Initiative.
However, Saudi Crown Prince   – the country's de facto leader, better known as MBS – confirmed earlier this week that the kingdom is nearing a US-backed deal with Israel. "Every day, we get closer," he told Fox News.
Palestinian officials have   previous Arab normalisation deals with Israel as "a stab in the back of the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people".
Praises US President Biden
Despite reports of frosty relations between Netanyahu and Joe Biden, the Israeli prime minister singled out the US president with praise on Friday.
Biden   with Netanyahu earlier this year over the Israeli leader's push to overhaul the Israeli judiciary, a move that his liberal critics have said would weaken the rule of law in the country.
The Biden administration also has criticised some of Netanyahu's policies against Palestinians while stressing that US support for Israel is "ironclad".
On Friday, however, Netanyahu repeatedly commended Biden's efforts to secure a Israel-Saudi Arabia deal. According to numerous media reports, such an agreement would involve formal   to Saudi Arabia.
"Two days ago, I discussed this vision of peace with President Biden. We share the same optimism for what can be achieved and I deeply appreciate his commitment to seize this historic opportunity," Netanyahu told the UNGA.
"The United States of America is indispensable in this effort. And just as we achieved the Abraham Accords with the leadership of President Trump, I believe we can achieve peace with Saudi Arabia with the leadership of President Biden."
Trump and Biden are heading towards a likely rematch of the 2020 election in next year's   in the US.Israel, which leading rights groups accuse of maintaining a   against Palestinians, receives at least $3.8bn in US military aid annually.
Calls for tough stance against Iran
Netanyahu pushed on Friday to paint Iran as the main source of conflict in the Middle East, urginga strong international response to curb Tehran's nuclear programme.
"The regime's aggression is largely met by indifference in the international community," he said of Iran.
"Eight years ago, the Western powers promised that if Iran violated the nuclear deal, the sanctions would  . Well, Iran is violating the deal, but the sanctions have not been snapped back."
Netanyahu was referring to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that saw Tehran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting international sanctions against its economy.
But Iran only began violating the agreement – which Israel vehemently opposes – after Trump nixed the pact in 2018.
The UN Security Council also resisted the former US president's efforts to reimpose so-called "snapback" UN sanctions on Iran over breaches of the agreement.
Iran remains under   that largely prevent other countries and international companies from doing business with Tehran out of fear of secondary penalties from Washington.
"To stop Iran's nuclear ambitions, this policy must change. Sanctions must be snapped back. And above all – above all – Iran must face a credible nuclear threat," Netanyahu said.
After the speech, several UN-based journalists reported that Israeli diplomats clarified that Netanyahu misspoke; he meant "credible military threat", not nuclear threat, in line with his previous statements, they said.

World leaders attend Cairo peace summit to 'de-escalate' Israel-Hamas war

October 21st, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Leaders and top officials from more than a dozen countries have gathered in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, for a conference to discuss ways to 'de-escalate' the Israel-Hamas war amid growing fears of a wider Middle East conflict.
Dubbed the Cairo Peace Summit, representatives from countries including Jordan, France, Germany, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, Qatar and South Africa are attending  the one-day meeting on Saturday, together with United Nations and European Union officials.
In his opening remarks, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi invited leaders to come to an agreement for a road map to end the humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip and revive a path to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The road map's goals included the delivery of aid to Gaza and agreeing a ceasefire, followed by negotiations leading to a two-state solution, he said.
"All civilian lives matter," Jordan's King Abdullah said, addressing the summit. "The relentless bombing campaign under way in Gaza as we speak is cruel and unconscionable on every level. It is collective punishment of a besieged and helpless people. It is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law. It is a war crime."
"Anywhere else, attacking civilian infrastructure and deliberately starving an entire population of food, water, electricity and basic necessities would be condemned. Accountability would be enforced … but not in Gaza," he added.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas attended the summit and asked for humanitarian corridors to be opened. But the absence of any official from the Israeli side has dampened expectations for what the summit can achieve.
Al Jazeera's diplomatic editor James Bays said that while it is good for these countries to propose a road map out of this crisis, "Is Israel going to listen to that road map?"
"Israel is not represented. It's Israeli generals and the Israeli prime minister and the Israeli war cabinet who have the decisions on what to do militarily, and you see as the speeches have been going on, fresh bombardment of Gaza," Bays noted.
The summit takes place as Israel readies a ground assault on Gaza, after weeks of aerial attacks following the October 7 attack by Hamas that killed 1,400 people in Israel. More than 4,200 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's counteroffensive, amid a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Egypt called for the international conference last week to discuss the "developments and future of the Palestinian cause'. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said the meeting would seek an "international concurrence" on the need for de-escalation and humanitarian aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip.
The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, the one access point not controlled by Israel, had been closed for nearly two weeks amid Israel's bombardment of the Strip but opened on Saturday to allow   in.
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, is worried about a mass exodus of Palestinians into its territory.
President el-Sisi said on Wednesday that Egyptians in their millions would oppose any forced displacement of Palestinians into Sinai, adding that any such move would turn the Egyptian peninsula into a base for attacks against Israel.
Egypt's position reflects Arab fears that Palestinians could again flee or be forced from their homes en masse, as they were during the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948.
Arab countries have voiced anger at Israel's unprecedented bombardment and siege of Gaza, home to 2.3 million people.
'Showboating'
Marc Owen Jones, assistant professor of Middle East studies at Doha's Hamad Bin Khalifa University, said there was "a large amount of political grandstanding" in the opening statements of Arab leaders at the Cairo summit as they re-affirmed their commitment to a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"A lot of this is about the domestic legitimacy of these leaders, particularly el-Sisi who is worried about the population becoming restive if they don't see him doing anything about the Palestinian cause," he told Al Jazeera.
Despite the "showboating", Owen Jones said the summit's impact on developments on the ground to be limited.
He said "the realistic practical outcomes" would be "at the most a ceasefire, and at the least a little more humanitarian aid going through".
"I can't see, without Israel at the table, that there's going to be a sufficient degree of political clout here to stop Israel's bombing of Gaza."
Clashes on Israel's border with Lebanon and attempted attacks byIranian-backed forceselsewhere have fuelled fears of a spillover, particularly if a ground offensive proves bloody, while growing anti-Islamic and anti-Semitic harassment around the world has raised security concerns in many countries.
European countries havestruggled tosettle on a united approach to the crisis, beyond condemning Hamas's attack, after days of confusion and mixed messaging.

Germany announces complete ban of Hamas activities

Germany has announced a complete ban on the activities of the Palestinian group Hamas and ordered the disbanding of a pro-Palestine group accused of spreading anti-Israel and anti-Semitic ideas.
In a statement on Thursday, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said she implemented a formal ban on activity by or in support of Hamas, which is already designated as a "terrorist" organisation in the country.
"With Hamas, I have today completely banned the activities of a terrorist organisation whose aim is to destroy the state of Israel," Faeser said.
A Hamas official in Lebanon said the move showed that the country was in partnership with Israel on crimes against Palestinian people.
"This prompts us to question whether the German political mentality is a Holocaust mentality that affects all peoples and is not limited to one party or another," Osama Hamdan, the Hamas representative in Lebanon, said in a news conference on Thursday.
Faeser said she also is banning and dissolving the German branch of the Samidoun network, which she said "supports and glorifies" groups including Hamas.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had announced that the government would take action against both groups on October 12.
Samidoun was behind an October 7 action in which a group of people handed out pastries in a Berlin street in celebration of Hamas's attack on Israel. At least 1,400 people were killed in the attack, most of whom were civilians, according to Israeli officials.
"Holding spontaneous 'jubilant celebrations' here in Germany in response to Hamas's terrible terrorist attacks against Israel demonstrates Samidoun's antisemitic, inhuman worldview in a particularly sickening way," Faeser said, as cited by Deutsche Welle.
Since the attack, Israel has bombarded Gaza relentlessly and tightened its blockade on the territory, cutting off supplies of fuel and severely restricting water, food and electricity access.
More than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed in the bombardment, including 3,760 children, according to authorities in Gaza.
 
Pro-Palestinian protests in many parts of Germany have been   in recent weeks, and schools in Berlin have been given permission to ban the traditional Palestinian headdress, the keffiyeh.
Pro-Palestinian activists in Germany say it amounts to a crackdown on Palestinians and a curtailment of free speech.
'All instruments of assembly law must be used to prevent solidarity demonstrations with the terror of Hamas as early as possible,' a spokesperson with the German Interior Ministry previously told Al Jazeera.
Amir Ali, a Palestinian who has been involved in organising protests in Munich, told Al Jazeera that a demonstration was cancelled after years of 'holding them peacefully with police cooperation'.
'I was even forbidden to walk inside the city for 24 hours because I was wearing a keffiyeh,' he said.

Australian arms exports to Israel in focus amid court case, port protests

November 10th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
Protests at shipping ports and a unique court case are bringing attention to Australian weapons exports to Israel  , a trade that critics describe as secretive and unaccountable.
"Few people know that Australia has one of the most secretive, unaccountable weapons export systems in the world,' Australian Greens Senator David Shoebridge told the Australian Senate on Tuesday.
A legal challenge launched in Australia's high court on Monday by Palestinian and Australian human rights organisations is also seeking to shed light on the shadowy trade.
The case, which is a first of its kind in Australia, comes as Australian supporters of Palestine have joined the international "block the boat" movement to protest against arms shipments to Israel.
A protest at Sydney's Port Botany expected on Saturday followed a similar protest at the Port of Melbourne on Wednesday where activists lay down in front of trucks carrying cargo for the Israeli shipping company Zim.
But determining whether shipments from Australia do, in fact, include weapons that are being sent to Israel is difficult due to a general lack of transparency around Australia's growing military export industry.
'Our government doesn't tell us who we're exporting weapons to; doesn't tell us what the weapons are; doesn't tell us who profits here in Australia from the sale of weapons,' Shoebridge said in the Senate this week.
The Australian government approves hundreds of military sales to Israel and we have no idea what the weapons are or how they are used. Even the US has more transparency on weapons sales than Australia. Time to tell the truth. pic.twitter.com/26FED23AvM
- David Shoebridge (@DavidShoebridge) November 7, 2023
 
Shoebridge said such information is much less available in Australia than in other countries, including the United States.
What is known is that Australia has issued 350 defence export permits to Israel since 2017, including 52 this year alone, according to the Australian Department of Defence. That information  was only made publicly available after direct questions from Shoebridge during Senate hearings this year.
'A large and growing arms industry'
Antony Loewenstein, an Australian journalist and author of the book, The Palestine Laboratory, said there is 'damning evidence' that Western states, including Australia, have been selling weapons that are "potentially being used in Gaza as we speak'.
Loewenstein, who was based in East Jerusalem between 2016 and 2020, has investigated how Israeli weaponry and   is used on Palestinians and exported around the world.
'There is bipartisan support [from major political parties] in Australia for a large and growing arms industry, regardless of the serious human rights concerns around that,' Loewenstein said.
'Secrecy benefits the arms industry', he told Al Jazeera.
"What matters ultimately is making money," he said.
"That's all it's about."
Australia was the 15th largest exporter of major arms globally in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) which monitors global arms sales.

Like Shoebridge, Loewenstein has welcomed the legal challenge announced by Palestinian and Australian human rights organisations on Monday. He says it could be a 'landmark case' that the Australian government will likely 'fight furiously' in the courts.
Al-Haq, one of the three Palestinian human rights organisations involved in the court case, is also involved in other  , including another potential case focused on arms exports by the United Kingdom to Israel.
Last month Al-Haq and the UK-based Global Legal Action Network (GLAN) wrote to the UK Secretary of State for International Trade, Kemi Badenoch, asking her to "suspend all weapons export licences to Israel".
If the export licences were not suspended, Al-Haq and GLAN said a judicial review challenge would be brought before the UK High Court.
In Australia, Al-Haq, along with the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR), has launched legal action in the Federal Court of Australia with the support of the Australian Centre for International Justice (ACIJ).
Unlike in the UK, the Australian case is focused on accessing information about Australian defence export permits to Israel that have been granted by the Minister for Defence since October 7, 2023.
Rawan Arraf, the executive director of ACIJ, told Al Jazeera that access to the export information is required in order to establish if it will be possible to launch proceedings to seek a judicial review of Australian permits to determine if any have been "made in error".
Such errors, Arraf says, could, for example, include whether Australia's 'Minister for Defence failed to consider criteria relevant to the risk that the export would be used to facilitate human rights abuses or may go to a country where they may be used contrary to Australia's international obligations".
The international obligations include the Geneva Conventions, the Genocide Convention and other international human rights law, she said.
In the UK, information pertaining to companies that are making requests for export permits, as well as the nature of the exports, and "even the dollar amount", is available, she added.
Asked about the legal action, Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles told the Australian public broadcaster ABC on Tuesday that "Israel has not sought any weapons from Australia and we have not provided any".
He added that he could not comment further while the matter was 'before the court'.
Marles's office sent a transcript of the interview to Al Jazeera when asked for the defence minister's position on the case.
Port protests
Australian activists who protested at the Port of Melbourne on Wednesday stopped trucks, including those carrying cargo for the Israeli shipping company Zim.
The protests join other similar protests including one at the   in the US and airport workers in Belgium who are refusing to handle military shipments to Israel.

Zim is a publicly listed Israeli shipping line, and it is not clear if any of the ships or trucks targeted by Australian protests have been carrying military equipment.
Organisers of the Sydney protest claimed Zim's role "in the Israeli war machine, has been relentless".
In an interview with Australian radio station 2GB about a protest planned at Sydney's Port Botany on Saturday, the Premier of NSW Chris Minns described Israel as "a longstanding trading partner and ally of Australia".
'It's ridiculous to suggest or think that trade will be stopped because of the personal preferences of individual protesters," he said.
'I didn't see these people down the port when it comes to trading with Cuba, or Saudi Arabia or China or any other country there may be disagreements with," Minns added.

Grief to courage: A Palestinian stranded in Egypt as Israel bombs Gaza

November 27th, 2023 ( Al Jazeera English  — Delivered by  Newstex )
'Hello, I'm Mohammed of the family Kafarna. I am 24 years old and a law graduate from Al-Azhar University in Gaza. I live in the city of Beit Hanoon, adjacent to the apartheid wall that the Israeli occupation built. I lost 15 people from my family. I lost two friends, we grew up with each other too.'
For most young people, being 24 means entering the workforce, enrolling in grad school or moving cities.
But for Mohammed Kafarna, a Palestinian lawyer marooned in Egypt, 24 means watching helplessly as his family and friends in Gaza are slaughtered.
This is his story as told to Al Jazeera through conversations, messages and voice notes.
October 3 – Cairo, Egypt
At the beginning of October, Mohammed went to Egypt for eye surgery he could not get in Gaza. He was not travelling for pleasure, but wanted to make the most of his journey, writing on social media that he didn't want to go home before seeing the 'beautiful places in Egypt'.
Mohammed wears glasses so he can see. In photos with his university friend Amjad al-Athamneh – who has since been killed in a bombing – his laugh lines reach all the way to their rounded frames.
Mohammed was among   of Palestinians who were in Egypt for medical treatment on October 7. So far, not one has made it back into Gaza.
October 4 – Cairo, Egypt
On October 4, Mohammed joked about taking photos of his travel buddies, saying his friends never took his picture.
'The worst thing in life,' he said playfully. Like many young people, he once delighted in sharing lighthearted pictures of himself on social media.
He could never have predicted the turn his life would take.
October 9 – Jabalia refugee camp, Gaza and Cairo, Egypt
On October 9, Mohammed's cousin Suhail was transferring money for Mohammed's surgery when an   targeted the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza.
Suhail was killed at the money exchange.
'We shared everything since childhood. I couldn't bear the news. I went into shock for three days.'
Mohammed spiralled into a bottomless pit after Suhail's death, whom he described as a brother. He could not pull himself out of bed.
Cut off from his family in Gaza, Mohammed had not had the surgery yet, and his ability to see took a backseat as he refused to have anyone else meet the same fate as Suhail to transfer money.
October 12 – Beit Hanoun, Gaza and Cairo, Egypt
On October 12, the house belonging to Maryam, Mohammed's sister, was bombed in Beit Hanoon. Her husband Ali and his entire extended family were killed.
Maryam, who was flung 50 metres (164 feet) by the force of the explosion, and her two daughters survived.
One of Mohammed's friends got a message to him from Gaza, breaking the news of his brother-in-law's death. He reassured Mohammed that his sister and nieces were alive – for now.
'After their home was bombed, they were displaced to the south of the Gaza Strip and were targeted again,' said Mohammed, his voice hollow.
Maryam was able to receive several vital surgeries but some of the care she needs will have to wait 'due to the lack of medicines and treatment in Gaza'. Her daughter Nihad suffered serious injuries and burns to her face while her daughter Sham's left hand was fractured.
Hospitals in Gaza are so damaged and out of supplies that they cannot offer care. Several have shut down.
Stranded in Egypt, Mohammed was tormented by his sister and nieces' suffering. Not only was he watching his family's pain but he had to confront the possibility that he might become the only one left to remember them.
He wanted the rest of the world to know what hospitals have had to do in Gaza, that some operations were done without anaesthesia because there just isn't any. So he went online to share atrocities being committed in Gaza.
'We do not want to die and be remembered as if we were just numbers. Each of us has a dream and a future that he was drawing in his imagination.'
His cousin Suhail's dream was to raise enough money to build his own house.

October 23 – Cairo, Egypt
'Today I reached out to my mother. I wasn't able to contact her for five days she told me they drank the contaminated water.'
His mother cried from hunger on the phone call, and Mohammed felt utterly helpless. How could he keep his family from starving while stuck in Cairo? He appealed on social media for someone in Deir el-Balah to help his family.
'I just need someone to help me,' Mohammed pleaded. '[My family] need gas to be able to make bread'
Israel's siege on Gaza forced Palestinians there to ration food and drink noxious water, conditions that have worsened life in what rights groups have for years called an 'open-air prison'.
Hopelessness threatened to overwhelm Mohammed. The world had turned its back on thousands of innocents.
'Israel is committing genocide and ethnic cleansing,' Mohammed said. 'We must stop this.'
October 25 – Southern Gaza Strip and Cairo, Egypt
On October 25, Ahmed Musa Shabat, another university friend of Mohammed's, went to a bakery in southern Gaza hoping to buy bread for his family. They had just fled south from Beit Hanoon.
Victory Bakery fed the whole region, according to Mohammed, and he believes it was targeted, along with the people buying bread. Ahmed and his cousin were killed.
There were attacks even on the southern areas to where the Israeli army told  civilians to flee. Those who headed south are still being slaughtered.
'Everything was one shock after another for me,' Mohammed disclosed with some difficulty. The number of deaths he was bombarded with over the past weeks had taken a toll on his mental state.
The same day Ahmed was killed, Mohammed heard that his cousin Muhammad and his young son Bassem had been killed in a bombing. Bassem was beheaded.
'His head is still under the rubble,' said Mohammed.

October 29 – Cairo, Egypt
Mohammed's tone had grown weary.
Hours earlier, he heard news that his friend Ibrahim's entire family had been killed. Ibrahim survived but is still in critical condition in an intensive care unit after a near-fatal head injury.
October 30 – Cairo, Egypt
Mohammed still hadn't gotten the eye surgery but his thoughts were now entirely on his friend Ibrahim, who he still has hope for.
'Pray for Ibrahim,' Mohammed implored. 'And let the world know that the massacres have not stopped.'
He wants to use his unforeseen position as a Palestinian in Egypt to raise awareness about the desperate situation in Gaza.
He appealed to the world to expose the human rights violations in Gaza, in Palestine.
'When will you take action to stop the massacres?' Mohammed challenged the international community.
'Your silence kills us more than their missiles.'
November 26 – Southern Gaza Strip and Cairo, Egypt
Mohammed made contact with his mother for the first time in 10 days.
When his family fled their home in early October, they did not know to bring clothes for the arduous month that lay ahead. His young nieces, he said, were shivering in the rain in the displacement camps.

Since he heard about the ceasefire, Mohammed has longed to see his mother and sister, but his mother warned him not to try to cross the border.
'You'd just be a burden on us here,' she told Mohammed. 'There is no good water, no electricity, and no food.'
'She told me to stay out and try to find work so that I can help them after the end of this aggression because we've seen life after the war before.'
Mohammed recounted his family being without electricity for more than a year, carrying water by hand for more than 10km (6.2 miles) or sleeping in frigid homes without doors and windows.
In Cairo, Egyptian landlords are hostile towards him and many displaced Palestinians who struggle to pay rent, according to Mohammed. He managed to find housing after scouring social media but others were not as lucky.
Even if those in Gaza were able to send money to their relatives abroad, those who fled Israeli air raids have no income. When Mohammed's family left the house, they brought no more than $150, which 'ran out after the seventh day of the war'.
Mohammed sketched out an old dream of his – to complete his law studies at Cairo University, specialising in international humanitarian law.

'This is what I dreamed of since my childhood, to represent my country and my cause in international forums, and to convey to the world the correct narrative of the Palestinian issue.'
Palestinians, Mohammed said, love life and have dreams and ambitions. 'They want to live in peace without fighting, killing, displacement.'
But after what he has experienced from afar in recent weeks, Mohammed is losing hope.
'I've been disappointed in my childhood dream,' he said.
'I have a feeling that my law degree will be torn up. Why do we study laws and rights if we cannot protect them?' He pleaded hopelessly.
'What is the benefit of adopting laws and agreements if we do not see their effectiveness in Gaza?'
'Do the children of Gaza not deserve security and peace like the rest of the world?'

WHO concerned about al-Shifa chief detained by Israel, remaining patients

The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern about the fate of the head of Gaza City's al-Shifa Hospital, Muhammad Abu Salmiya, who was   this week.
The WHO said in a statement on Friday that the director of the biggest hospital in the besieged Palestinian territory had been arrested on Wednesday along with five other health workers, while they were taking part in a United Nations mission to evacuate patients.
"Three medical personnel from the Palestine Red Crescent Society and three from the Ministry of Health were detained," the WHO said.
Since then, two of the six have reportedly been released, but "we do not have information about the well-being of the four remaining health staff, including the director of Al-Shifa hospital," the statement added.
The UN agency called for "their legal and human rights to be fully observed during their detention".
A spokesperson for the Israeli army said on Saturday that Abu Salmiya was being questioned.
'We are currently moving forward with questioning him over the fact that he was the head of a hospital that was really sitting on top of an entire terror network,' Israeli military spokesperson Doron Spielman said.
'How could he not know what's happening? We have hostages that were on, you know, CCTV in his hospital.'
The Israeli army, which raided the hospital last week, has   that Hamas fighters used a tunnel complex beneath al-Shifa as a command centre – an assertion Hamas and hospital officials have repeatedly denied. Israel has not provided any evidence to back up its claim.
Concern for remaining patients
Abu Salmiya has frequently been quoted by international media about the conditions inside al-Shifa, a major focus of the   following attacks by Hamas fighters on October 7.
A week ago, the Israeli army ordered an   of al-Shifa, which had housed 7,000 people including patients and displaced Palestinians. But dozens of patients who could not be moved remained inside with a handful of medics.
The WHO has carried out three evacuation missions to the hospital in the space of a week, the organisation said, on one occasion managing to transfer 31 babies from the hospital.
During the third mission on Wednesday, which was carried out in cooperation with the Palestine Red Crescent, 151 people were evacuated, including patients, their relatives and healthcare workers, according to the WHO.
A WHO spokesperson said on Friday that the UN agency was working on further evacuations from northern Gaza hospitals as soon as possible as a truce gets under way, voicing fears for the safety of those remaining in al-Shifa Hospital.
"We're extremely concerned about the safety of the estimated 100 patients and health workers remaining at al-Shifa," said WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier.
He declined to react to comments from the Gaza health ministry saying it was suspending cooperation with the global health agency amid reports that Israel is holding medical staff for questioning.

Israeli flags adorn EU buildings after Hamas attacks. Is the bloc united?

Brussels, Belgium – After Hamas's   in Israel, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Bulgarian parliament were among buildings across the European Union that were lit up in the white and blue of Israel's flag.
In other demonstrations of solidarity, the European Commission and European Parliament hoisted Israeli flags outside their headquarters in Brussels.
On Wednesday, as part of a European Parliament vigil led by its president, Roberta Metsola, a minute's silence was held to commemorate the Israeli victims and the country's national anthem was played through speakers.
The Hamas assault on Saturday set off a major new war, with Israel now preparing a ground invasion of Gaza, having   the besieged strip. More than 2,000 people on both sides have been reported killed since Saturday.
"This is a strong message against terrorism in Israel," an Austrian tourist in Paris said of the Eiffel Tower display.
"So what if it is the EU stance on the conflict now?" said the woman, who requested anonymity.
But some said the gestures do not represent them.
'As a European citizen, I felt that my voice was erased through that action,' Elena, from Italy, told Al Jazeera.
"I was shocked. Especially when I saw [the Israeli flag] on the EU Parliament building. It's the house of democratically elected representatives of Europe, many of whom do not simply 'stand with Israel'.
'I was also shocked at how quickly the EU institutions put up the flags, I think it was even faster than Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Considering the incredibly complex situation of Israel and Palestine, I think this rapid step is incredibly irresponsible."

In the diplomatic corridors of Brussels, too, debates over the flag were heated.
One EU official, who requested anonymity, told Al Jazeera: 'It makes me feel like I'm working for an organisation that is endorsing apartheid.
'Did the commission put the Palestinian flag up when the IDF shot teenagers in the ankles last week? Or when they killed journalist  ? What Hamas is doing is terrible – but is it any different to what the IDF does every week?' the official said, referencing the May 2022 Israeli killing of Al Jazeera's journalist, and recent reports that Israeli troops have been targeting young Palestinian protesters.
But, the bloc's foreign policy chief, Peter Stano, said that now is not the time to squabble over demonstrations of support, but rather focus on the grave situation in the Middle East.
'We are the only ones actively pursuing the restart of the peace process and are the biggest donor to the Palestinian people anyway,' he told Al Jazeera.
Diplomatic fallout
On Monday, as Israel retaliated to Hamas's attacks by bombarding Gaza, EU Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi said that the European Commission would suspend 691 million euros ($728m) in developmental aid to Palestine, sparking a brief diplomatic fallout.
The foreign ministers of EU nations such as Spain, Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg criticised Varhelyi's announcement, saying only the bloc's foreign ministers can make such a decision.
"But where were the other countries, like Germany? Member states need to stand up against this rogue commissioner," the EU official told Al Jazeera.
The EU has   back-pedalled, saying it won't suspend the aid but rather review payments to ensure they are not misused. Even so, tensions remain.

'I find these suggestions to stop aid to Palestine very difficult to understand,' Sven Kuhn von Burgsdorff, the former EU ambassador to Palestine, told Al Jazeera.
'Hamas does not represent the people of Palestine. Why would we want to punish the people of Palestine? Also, all EU aid to the Palestinians is very thoroughly monitored. We scrutinise every single household member and bank account holder receiving aid and if any are linked to terrorists, he or she will not receive any aid. So I can 100 percent say that not a single cent goes to Hamas,' he said.
'Under the current arrangement, we deliver budgetary aid only to the Palestinian Authority, which sits in Ramallah, and don't deliver anything to Gaza, with the exception of a social aid allowance package which benefits poor families in Gaza."
European Parliament Member Evin Incir, a Swedish politician, told Al Jazeera that Varhelyi is well aware of how aid reaches Palestinians.
"He is trying to lie in the face of the European people and trying to connect the EU financial support to Hamas. It doesn't go there. It goes through the Palestinian Authority," she said.
The bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that 'punishing all the Palestinian people' will "damage the EU's interests in the region and embolden terrorists".
After he met with EU foreign ministers on Tuesday, Borrell said: 'The overwhelming majority of the member states considered that we have to continue our support to the Palestinian Authority and the payments due should not be delayed."
(Al Jazeera)
The European Union officially says  it is committed to the "vision of an independent and sovereign state of Palestine, living side by side with Israel in peace and security".
But the bloc's stance on all matters related to the Israel-Palestine conflict is complex and divisive.
"Some nations like Ireland have a recent history of colonialism, and so they're particularly aware of the oppression of Palestinians," the EU official told Al Jazeera.
Another EU diplomat said that amid the latest war, showing solidarity with the "Palestinian side … means you can also be accused of being anti-Israeli or even worse, anti-Semitic', a second EU diplomat, who also requested anonymity, told Al Jazeera. 'The fact that the European Commission and European Parliament [are] displaying the Israel flag appears to be a reflection of a general political preference for Israel, of these two institutions."
The second diplomat noted, however, that the "European Council chose not to do so, mindful of the divisions between EU member states".

In a recent briefing, a European Commission spokesperson told journalists that the body responds to "terror" attacks in the same way, regardless of where they occur, claiming its statements on Israel's right to self-defence have nothing to do with its position on the Israel-Palestine conflict.
The spokesperson added that the commission is now focusing on matters "on the ground" and not "internal debates" within the bloc.
Meanwhile, according to emails seen by Al Jazeera, the European Parliament's vigil on Wednesday raised concerns among some.
Members of the Parliament's Left group questioned why sombre events were not previously held for Palestinian victims of Israeli occupation.
Incir, the left-wing Swedish politician, said she would prefer to see the Israeli and Palestinian flags hanging next to each other outside European institutions.
"That would have sent a clear signal from the European Union that the only way forward is a two-state solution, with two democratic states living in peace and security side by side,' she told Al Jazeera.
"The bombs are raining down on innocent people in Gaza. This is unacceptable and must also be condemned. It's about the credibility of the European Union and its commitment to a two-state solution."
How do Europeans want EU politicians to respond?
After meeting with the bloc's foreign ministers, Borrell said that while Israel has the right to self-defence, its operations must be in line with international and humanitarian law, acknowledging that so far, "some of the decisions are contrary to international law".
For Katie, from Ireland, the EU appears to be making a statement.
'The EU hasn't really 'picked a side' before. But seeing the flags everywhere alongside their statements makes me feel like they have picked one,' she told Al Jazeera.
Nina, from the Netherlands, said while the Hamas attacks were "awful and wrong … we cannot forget the gradual acts of violence and war Israel has been conducting without any criticism".
She said it seemed "hypocritical" to put up Israeli flags but not Palestinian flags "when they have been oppressed every day for decades'.
"Also Hamas is not the same as the PA and punishing all Palestinians for Hamas's actions is very harmful and contributes to the already harmful European practices of looking away from Israel's misconduct," she added.
Marco from Belgium shared a similar view.
'In Palestine, like in Ukraine and Israel, innocent people are dying because for decades we have turned a blind eye to evil,' he said. 'EU leaders should be able to condemn last week's terrorist attack in Israel while also holding the Israeli government accountable for the criminal actions that have led up to this moment."
